Description
General: Figwort Family (Scrophulariaceae).
Penstemon or beardtongue species are perennial forbs
or sub-shrubs to shrubs with attractive flowers. They
are short to long-lived. Eaton’s penstemon is a short-
lived perennial herbaceous forb with red flowers. It
is recognized as having three varieties: P. eatonii ssp.
eatonii, P. eatonii ssp. exsertus, and P. eatonii ssp.
undosus. Cronquist et al. (1984) provides a key
separating eatonii from undosus and notes the key
characteristics for exsertus.
Penstemons have opposite, entire, or toothed leaves.
They have several stalked flowers or flower clusters
that are borne in the axils of the upper leaves or
leaflike bracts. The tubular corolla is strongly to
distinctly two-lipped at the mouth with a two-lobed
William S. Moye upper lip and a three-lobed lower lip. There are 4
