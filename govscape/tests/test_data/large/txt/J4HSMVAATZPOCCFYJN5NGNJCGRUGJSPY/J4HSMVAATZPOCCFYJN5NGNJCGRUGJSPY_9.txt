randomly scheduled in the establishments where the RTE processes existed.
Results were recorded both by the HACCP Processes used for scheduling and by the
10 product categories listed in Table 4 (USDA/FSIS microbiological HACCP
verification testing program for RTE meat and poultry products produced in USDA-
inspected establishments). Laboratory personnel assign the Table 4 product
categories to the product samples when they arrived at the laboratory.
The 10 product categories were identified based on factors that could be expected to
affect the probability that a product could become contaminated during post-lethality
exposure or factors that could relate to the effectiveness of the kill step. For
example, the categories identified products that were exposed to unique types of
post-lethality processing equipment such as peelers or slicers or shredders. The
categories also distinguished whole muscle cuts from products where the internal
tissues were more likely to have been contaminated before the kill step, e.g., a
chopped and formed product.
The sampling projects implemented in December 2000 added both RTE products and
establishments that had not been included in the nine microbiology monitoring
projects reported for 1990 through 2000. In addition, FSIS Directive 10,240.2
provided for reduced sampling frequency in establishments that had sampling
programs meeting criteria outlined in the Directive. Thus, the results for 2001 and
2002 are not directly comparable to the results published for previous years.
