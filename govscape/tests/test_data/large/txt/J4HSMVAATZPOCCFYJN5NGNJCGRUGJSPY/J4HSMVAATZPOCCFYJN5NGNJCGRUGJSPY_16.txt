selected for RLm based on a risk ranking algorithm that is formed by previously
developed peer-reviewed risk assessments and the ongoing results from FSIS tests
of RTE meat and poultry products. Once an establishment is selected for RLm, the
products are selected using the same hierarchy as described above for RTE001. That
hierarchy is based on what is usually referred to as the FDA-FSIS risk ranking model
summarized at http://www.foodsafety.gov/~dms/lmr2-su.html. Instructions for RLm
are contained in FSIS Directive 10,240.5, March 15, 2006 (PDF Only).
The results for CY 2006 are presented in Tables 17 and 18. The 10 product
categories listed in Table 4 were continued for CY 2006, so all results are organized
around those 10 product categories. The results from CY 2006 for Salmonella are
presented in Table 17. The results for L. monocytogenes are presented in Table 18.
Table 18 includes the product sampling results from RLm, designated as RLmPROD
to indicate it is just the product portion of RLm. A total of 12,372 products were
tested for L. monocytogenes in CY 2006, excluding all follow-up sampling and
sampling of imported products. The percentage of positive product samples across all
projects was 0.48%. Table 18 does not include 2,745 product contact surface and
environmental samples that were analyzed as part of RLm. Thus, the number of L.
monocytogenes analyses remained above 15,000 for the second consecutive year
and the total number of analyses for L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli
O157:H7 was 27,505.
