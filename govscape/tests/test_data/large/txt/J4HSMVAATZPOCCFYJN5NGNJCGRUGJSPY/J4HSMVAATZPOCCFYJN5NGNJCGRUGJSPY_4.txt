so all results are organized around those 10 product categories. The results from CY
2007 for Salmonella are presented in Table 19. The results for L. monocytogenes are
presented in Table 20. Table 20 includes the product sampling results from RLm,
designated as RLmPROD to indicate it is just the product portion of RLm. A total of
12,665 products were tested for L. monocytogenes in CY 2007, excluding all follow-
up sampling and sampling of imported products. The percentage of positive product
samples across all projects was 0.43%. Table 18 does not include 5,198 product
contact surface and environmental samples that were analyzed as part of RLm. The
total number of analyses for L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 in
CY 2007 was 30,113, not including follow-up samples and imports. The total of
30,113 analyses increased from 27,505 in CY 2006.
Discussion of Trends
As was mentioned above, FSIS does not view the results of regulatory testing as
estimates of national product prevalence. The Agency does, however, consider the
RTE regulatory results to be an excellent indicator of the trends in pathogen
presence in RTE products over several years. The Agency implemented the ALLRTE
project in order to have L. monocytogenes results that could be better compared
with earlier years (before CY 2004) as the Agency moved to make its RTE projects
less random and more risk-based.
Last year, the Agency recognized that changes in how samples were scheduled did
limit the ALLRTE results as a trend indicator. The concept behind ALLRTE was to get
a random sample across the full range of RTE products and across all establishments
producing an RTE product. Because many establishments are scheduled almost
every month under RTE001, they are never sampled under ALLRTE. Because of
