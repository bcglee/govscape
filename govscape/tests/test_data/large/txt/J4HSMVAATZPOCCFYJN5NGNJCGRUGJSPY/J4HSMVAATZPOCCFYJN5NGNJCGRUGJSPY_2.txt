for L. monocytogenes.
There were no new projects added for CY2007, as FSIS continued the ALLRTE,
RTE001, and RLm projects described below for the year when they were introduced.
During 2007, there was a modification to the RTE001 project. Following an incident
where an unusual proportion of a product using growth inhibitors was found to be L.
monocytogenes positive, the risk based algorithm was adjusted to ensure that more
products using antimicrobials or growth inhibitors were sampled. During April, the
algorithm was modified to ensure that 50 percent of the samples each month were
scheduled in establishments reporting production of Alternative 2b products, i.e.,
products with an antimicrobial or growth inhibitor but without any post exposure
pasteurization. As originally designed, the algorithm will direct the majority of
samples to establishments using sanitation alone to control L. monocytogenes in RTE
products, i.e., establishments reporting using Alternative 3. There is no way to
assess what effect this modification had on the overall CY2007 results for RTE001.
For projects other than RLm, when an establishment is selected for testing, the
inspection program personnel are sent a sample request form identifying the
sampling project, the microbial hazard(s) for which the sample of product will be
analyzed, and the FSIS laboratory to which the sample is to be sent. The form also
identifies a window of time within which to collect a sample of product for shipment
to an FSIS laboratory. Additional guidance for how to select the product to be
sampled is contained in different FSIS Directives. After the product or product
category is identified, the sample is randomly selected. All samples (except RLm) are
analyzed for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. A few specific products containing
beef are also analyzed for Escherichia coli O157:H7.
