RESULTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS
The 1990–2000 Results
The information presented in Table 1 (USDA/FSIS microbiological testing projects for
RTE meat and poultry products produced in USDA-inspected establishments in CY
1990-2000) lists the product categories used for scheduling samples collected until
the end of 2000. Table 2 (Percent Positive Salmonella Tests for RTE meat and poultry
products, CY 1999-2000) and Table 3 (Percent Positive L. monocytogenes Tests for
RTE meat and poultry products, CY 1990-2000) represent 11 years (1990-2000) of
results from FSIS testing of RTE meat and poultry products. A more detailed
description of these microbiological testing projects and test results for the years
1990 through 1999 has been published in the Journal of Food Protection, Vol. 64, No.
8, 2001, Pages 1188-1193.
The 2001–2002 Results
In December of 2000, FSIS discontinued basing its RTE testing program on selected
product categories and instead began basing the program on Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Point (HACCP) processing categories identified in 9 CFR 417.2 that
apply to ready-to-eat (RTE) products. This is detailed in FSIS Directive 10,240.2,
Microbial Sampling of Ready-to-Eat (RTE) Products for the FSIS Verification Testing
Program, which became effective in December 2000. The Performance Based
Inspection System (PBIS) identified the establishments that had HACCP plans in the
processes like 03G, Fully Cooked/Not Shelf Stable or 03E, Not Heat Treated/Shelf
Stable or 03F, Heat Treated/Shelf Stable, or 03I, Product with Secondary
Inhibitors/Not Shelf Stable. Thus, samples were scheduled based on the different
RTE HACCP Processes utilized in USDA-Inspected establishments. Samples were
