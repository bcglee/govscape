Directive 10,240.3, when inspection program personnel received a form requesting a
sample under the Target project, the form included instructions to collect a RTE
sample from other than non-targeted products, giving priority to high (e.g., deli
meats) and medium risk products (e.g., franks/hotdogs). Each form requested the
collector to designate the product as a targeted product or low-targeted product.
Under the Target project, all establishments producing targeted or low-targeted RTE
products were equally likely to be scheduled each month. Under FSIS Directive
10,240.3, FSIS did not sample non-targeted products. The reduced sampling
frequency, that had been part of FSIS Directive 10,240.2, was discontinued.
The results for CY 2003 are presented in Tables 11 and 12. The 10 product
categories listed in Table 4 were continued for CY 2003 so all results are organized
around those 10 product categories. The results from CY 2003 for Salmonella are
presented in Table 11. The results for L. monocytogenes are presented in Table 12.
The majority of results are for targeted products. For L. monocytogenes, the results
for targeted and low-targeted products were essentially the same, 0.81 percent
positive for targeted products and 0.84 percent positive for low-targeted products.
However, there was no expectation that the contamination levels at production
would be different, only the potential for growth during the shelf life.
FSIS Directive 10,240.3 is no longer available on the Web site. See the current RTE
sampling directive: FSIS Directive 10,240.4, Revision 1, March 15, 2006 (PDF Only).
