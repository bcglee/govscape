continuing concerns about ALLRTE as a good trend indicator, the Agency, for this
year, included two graphs illustrating the trend in results from regulatory sampling
for Lm, one using the ALLRTE results from CY 2004 through CY 2007 and the other
using the sum of all product sampling from each year, regardless of whether the
sampling was random or based on a risk-based algorithm.
For CY 2007, the ALLRTE project had 11 positive L. monocytogenes results in 2,963
samples, a positive rate of 0.37%. That result is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1
illustrates the trend for the percentage of RTE regulatory samples positive for L.
monocytogenes during the time period from 1990 through 2007, using the ALLRTE
project for 2004 through 2007. Figure 2 illustrates the trend for the percentage of
RTE regulatory samples positive for L. monocytogenes during the time period from
1990 through 2007, using all product sampling from 2004 through 2007. When
examining overall trends in regulatory findings, the two graphs show the same thing.
That is, there has been a continuing and consistent decline in the percentage of
positive samples in the projects where FSIS analyzes RTE meat and poultry products
for L. monocytogenes. In both cases, CY 2007 has the lowest level of positive L.
monocytogenes samples to date.
For CY 2007, the RTE001 had 42 positive L. monocytogenes results in 8,690
samples, a positive rate of 0.48%, almost the same as the CY 2006 rate of 0.47 %.
The last two years can be compared to the 51 positives in 7,089 RTE001 samples
(0.72%) for CY 2005. This decrease is very important in terms of consumer exposure
to L. monocytogenes contamination occurring during the production and packaging
of higher risk products. Even with the CY 2007 modification discussed earlier,
RTE001 remains a risk-based project that targets the higher risk product categories
