there would be an expectation that the percentage of positive samples would be
higher in RTERISK1 than under ALLRTE sampling. The 2004 findings did show some
difference.
The results for CY 2004 are presented in Tables 13 and 14. The 10 product
categories listed in Table 4 were continued for CY 2004 so all results are organized
around those 10 product categories. The results from CY 2004 for Salmonella are
presented in Table 13. The results for L. monocytogenes are presented in Table 14.
FSIS Directive 10,240.4, issued October 2, 2003 is no longer available on the Web
site. However, the project for ALLRTE is still in place under the current RTE sampling
directive: FSIS Directive 10,240.4, Revision 1, March 15, 2006 (PDF Only). The
project RTERISK1 was continued through CY 2005, but was discontinued at the
beginning of CY 2006.
The 2005 Results
During CY 2005, FSIS continued projects ALLRTE and RTERISK1 that were initiated
in CY 2004. FSIS also initiated a new project identified as RTE001. This new project
is the first HACCP verification project where RTE establishments are not equally likely
to be scheduled each month. Rather, each month an RTE001 sample is requested
from a list of establishments with the highest risk ranking for L. monocytogenes. This
ranking is based on a number of factors including the RTE Alternative(s) used by the
establishment, the volume of production for post-lethality exposed products, and the
sample results from previous testing for L. monocytogenes.
The instructions for implementing RTE001 were first issued as FSIS Notice 61-04,
