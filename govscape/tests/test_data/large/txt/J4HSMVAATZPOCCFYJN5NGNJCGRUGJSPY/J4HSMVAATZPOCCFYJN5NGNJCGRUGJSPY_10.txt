poultry products, CY 2002), Table 8 (Percent Positive L. monocytogenes Tests for
RTE meat and poultry products, CY 2002), Table 9 (Percent Positive Salmonella Tests
for RTE meat and poultry products, CY 2001-2002-combined results), and Table 10
(Percent Positive L. monocytogenes Tests for RTE meat and poultry products, CY
2001-2002-combined results), represent the percentage of positive regulatory
samples collected and analyzed under FSIS Directive 10,240.2.
The overall RTE sampling program, under which those products were tested and
whose results are displayed in Tables 5 through 10, was outlined in FSIS Directive
10,240.2, which was issued in December 2000, but is no longer available on the
FSIS Web site. See current RTE sampling directive: FSIS Directive 10,240.4,
Revision 1, March 15, 2006 (PDF Only).
The 2003 Results
FSIS Directive 10,240.3 defined three categories of products; targeted, low-targeted
and non-targeted products. Low-targeted products included products that were less
likely to support growth of L. monocytogenes because of low pH, low water activity,
the addition of antimicrobial agents, or because the product could be expected to
remain frozen from production until preparation for consumption. Non-targeted
products included regulated products such as lard, mixtures of animal fats, popped
pork skins, dried soup mixes, and products labeled for further processing in which
the product would be expected to receive a lethality treatment.
Most of the RTE sampling for 2003 was conducted under a project designated as
Target sampling for the collection of targeted and low-targeted products. Under FSIS
