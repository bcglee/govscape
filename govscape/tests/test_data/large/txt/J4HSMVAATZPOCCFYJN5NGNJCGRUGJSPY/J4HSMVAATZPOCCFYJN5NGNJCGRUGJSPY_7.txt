analyzed 9,381 samples of unpeeled sausage products and found 62 positive results
(0.66 percent positive). For CY 2006, the percentage of unpeeled sausage samples
positive for L. monocytogenes was only 0.14 percent, only 4 positives in 2,903
samples. The 2007 results were almost the same with 4 positives in 2,656 samples,
or 0.15 percent. The last two years represent a noticeable change for this product
category.
As noted above, the 10 product categories were also based on factors that could
relate to the effectiveness of the kill step. The Salmonella results for RTE products do
not indicate any differences related to the effectiveness of lethality. FSIS testing has
consistently found very low levels of Salmonella in RTE products. While the
percentage of samples positive for Salmonella in CY 2006 had been the lowest level
since the implementation of HACCP (2 positives in 11,842 samples), FSIS found 10
positives in 11,651 samples for CY2007 (0.09 percent), the highest percentage since
2002.
Lastly, all of the results presented here so far are for Salmonella and L.
monocytogenes. For some of the time period the Agency has also tested RTE
products for E. coli O157:H7 and staphylococcal enterotoxins. From 1994 through
2007, 8,282 RTE products (cooked beef patties and dry fermented sausages) were
tested for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 (excluding imported products). All RTE
samples tested for E. coli O157:H7 have been negative. Between 1994 and
December 2002, 3,105 RTE products were tested for the presence of staphylococcal
enterotoxins. FSIS stopped testing RTE products for staphylococcal enterotoxins in
January 2003. All RTE samples tested for staphylococcal enterotoxins were negative.
