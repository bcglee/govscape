Any product represented by a positive sample result must be reprocessed or
destroyed. Most establishments voluntarily hold all RTE product represented by a
specific regulatory sample pending notification of the FSIS laboratory test results. If
all product implicated by a positive laboratory result is not under the establishment's
control, then steps must be taken by the producing establishment to remove
adulterated product from distribution channels and/or commerce, which may entail a
voluntary recall.
With the posting of the CY 2004 RTE microbiological testing program results FSIS
revised the nomenclature that had previously been used. Results are now reported
as both the number and percentage of analyzed samples that have tested positive
for Salmonella or L. monocytogenes. Previous postings described these results as
"prevalence." However, the term "prevalence" seems to imply that results from the
regulatory sampling projects are statistical estimates of national product prevalence.
To avoid confusion, FSIS will now only use "prevalence" to describe testing results
from nationwide baseline studies specifically designed to provide statistically valid
baseline estimates of national product prevalence for various microorganisms and for
regulatory purposes. Results of regulatory testing projects conducted to verify the
effectiveness of food safety systems, and not designed to provide statistically valid
baseline estimates of national product prevalence, will be reported as the percent of
analyzed samples that tested positive.
The 2007 Results
The results for CY 2007 are presented in Tables 19 and 20. The 10 product
categories introduced in CY 2001 and listed in Table 4 were continued for CY 2007,
