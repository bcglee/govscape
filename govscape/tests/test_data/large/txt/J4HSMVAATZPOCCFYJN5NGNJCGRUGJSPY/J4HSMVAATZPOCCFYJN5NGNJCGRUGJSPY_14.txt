issued on December 23, 2004, which were later incorporated into FSIS Directive
10,240.4, March 15, 2006 (PDF Only). This Directive instructs sample collectors to
select the highest risk post-lethality exposed RTE product produced at the time of
collection. Directive 10,240.4 provides a hierarchy of products to sample that has
been revised from that described above for RTERISK 1. A key difference is that deli
products have been divided into those that are sliced in the inspected establishment
and those shipped intact to be sliced at grocery store deli counters and other retail
outlets. The hierarchy for RTE001 is:
1. Deli-meats that are sliced in the federal establishment
2. Deli-meats shipped whole from the federal establishment (this does not
include cook-in-bag products; only those exposed post-lethality)
3. Hotdog Products
4. Deli salads, pâtés, and meat spreads
5. Fully cooked type products (other than cooked products in 1-4 above)
6. Fermented products
7. Dried products
8. Salt-cured products
9. Products labeled as "Keep Frozen".
The results for CY 2005 are presented in Tables 15 and 16. There was a major
increase in RTE sampling in CY 2005, where almost 16,000 samples were analyzed
