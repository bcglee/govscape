of deli meats and hotdogs. This project is now the primary project where inspectors
collect a single product on a specific day. This project is complemented by the RLm
project.
The 10 product categories, introduced in December of 2000, were identified based on
factors that could be expected to affect the probability that a product could become
contaminated during post-lethality exposure or factors that could relate to the
effectiveness of the kill step. Over the past several years, these product categories
have appeared to provide some differentiation in the results, at least in the area of
potential for post-lethality exposure to L. monocytogenes. For example, when FSIS
reported the CY 2004 data, the Agency noted that the highest percentage of samples
positive for L. monocytogenes in each year had been in the sliced, diced, and
shredded product category where exposure to product contact surfaces would be
considered high. From 2001 through 2004, FSIS had analyzed samples from 5,143
sliced, diced, or shredded products and recorded 91 positive results (1.77 percent
positive). In CY 2005 and CY 2006 the percentages of positive samples for sliced
and diced products were noticeably lower, 0.67 percent and 0.83 percent,
respectively. In CY 2007, FSIS analyzed 3,408 samples of sliced and diced products
and found positive results in only 0.38 percent, a dramatic change from the 2.59
percent positive of CY2001. For CY 2007, the highest positive rate was for multi-
component products at 0.88 percent (12 positives in 1,356 samples). Examples of
multi-component products include sandwiches or wraps or dishes such as lasagna
and chicken fried rice.
The other category where there have historically been a large number of samples is
the product category of unpeeled sausage products. From 2001 through 2005, FSIS
