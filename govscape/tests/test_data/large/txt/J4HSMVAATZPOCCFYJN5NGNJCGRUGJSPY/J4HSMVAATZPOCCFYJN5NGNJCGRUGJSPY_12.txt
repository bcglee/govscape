The 2004 Results
FSIS issued Directive 10,240.4 in October 2003 to implement 9 CFR part 430 that
was published on June 6, 2003 (68 FR 34207). Under the new Directive, the Agency
defined two new sampling projects for CY 2004. These projects were identified as All
Ready-to-Eat (ALLRTE) and Ready-to-Eat Risk1 (RTERISK1). Under the project
ALLRTE, inspection program personnel were instructed to collect, at random, a RTE
product that fit the previous definitions of targeted or low-targeted products. In
other words, the Agency wanted random samples across a wide variety of RTE
products, but didn't want to expend resources testing the products that have low risk
for supporting growth of pathogens like fats and oils, dried soup mixes, and popped
pork skins.
Most of the samples would be scheduled under RTERISK1. Product selection under
RTERISK1 would be based on the risk-based guidance provided in FSIS Directive
10,240.4, October 2003. Under both projects, all RTE establishments were equally
likely to be scheduled each month. However, once a RTERISK1 sample was
scheduled, inspection program personnel were instructed to collect only Alternative 3
products if they were available. (Definitions for RTE Alternatives 1, 2, and 3, can be
found in 9 CFR 430.4.) Within Alternative 3, FSIS Directive 10,240.4 provided the
hierarchy of (1) deli meats, (2) hotdogs, (3) deli salads, pâté, meat spreads, and (4)
other product. Inspection program personnel would collect an Alternative 2 product
only when Alternative 3 was not available, and an Alternative 1 product only if the
establishment produced no Alternative 2 or 3 products. The intent of this risk based
sampling project was to always select the highest risk product. So an establishment
that was always producing Alternative 3 deli meats would have their Alternative 3
deli meats sampled every time a RTERISK1 sample was scheduled. For this reason,
