Throughout the history of the FSIS microbiological RTE regulatory sampling program,
the individual projects have been continuously evolving in response to public health
concerns. The data reported here are from these individual sampling projects that
have been implemented under the overall RTE program. This testing program has
not been designed to test for statistically significant changes from one year to the
next. The aggregate data do, however, provide an overall indication of trends.
Through 2004, for all projects, establishments were randomly selected for regulatory
samples from different sub-populations or from the total population of
establishments producing RTE products. During 2005, FSIS implemented a new
project where the establishments are selected for sampling based on different risk
factors for L. monocytogenes. The new project, designated RTE001, is described
below with the 2005 results. RTE001 became the primary sampling project in 2006,
representing almost 70 percent of regulatory product sampling. In 2006, FSIS
introduced a second project based on risk factors referred to as phase 2 of L.
monocytogenes risk-based sampling and designated as RLm. RLm includes sampling
of products, product contact surfaces and environmental surfaces in conjunction with
a comprehensive Food Safety Assessment (FSA). The scheduling of RLm is
coordinated through the District Offices. FSIS Directive 10,240.5 (March 15, 2006;
PDF Only) provides direction to Enforcement, Investigations, and Analysis Officers
(EIAOs) and Public Health Veterinarians (PHVs) trained in the EIAO methodology for
collecting samples under the RLm sampling project. RLm samples are analyzed only
