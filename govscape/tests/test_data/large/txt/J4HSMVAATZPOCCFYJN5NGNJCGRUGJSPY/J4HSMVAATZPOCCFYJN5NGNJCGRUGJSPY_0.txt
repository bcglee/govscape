INTRODUCTION
FSIS has conducted a regulatory microbiological testing program on Ready-To-Eat
(RTE) meat and poultry products since 1983. The data reported here are from
product sampling projects covering the years 1990 through 2007. These data do not
include the results of follow-up sampling that FSIS conducts in response to a positive
result. Products sampled and the microbial hazards for which they are analyzed are
those of public health concern. FSIS also analyses samples of RTE egg products for
Salmonella. The results from those analyses are not included here. All regulatory
analyses of RTE products are performed in FSIS laboratories located in Alameda, CA,
