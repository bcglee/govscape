13. ABSTRACT
Bromacil and Tandex were applied to one-acre plots as granules and as sprays
using rotary-wing aircraft, and as granules using fixed-wing aircraft. Granular ma-
terials were applied at rates ranging from 11 to 200 Ibs/A. Spray volumes ranged
from 10 to 40 gal/A.
The spray volumes dispensed did not differ more than five percent from scheduled
amounts, but the output of granular materials was more variable. The greatest diffi-
culty in delivery was encountered with granules formed on a sand core. Individual
sand grains interferred with the proper operation of gates in the rotary-wing distri-
butors. Also, the variation between scheduled and measured delivery of granules from
rotary-wing equipment was greatest when less than 25 Ib/A was applied, indicating a
need for a less sensitive gate design.
Distribution of applied materials was measured by collecting samples of granules
for weighing or samples of dyed spray for colorimetric determination. Generally, the
distribution patterns were satisfactory.
The characteristics of each type of aircraft and the different forms of materials
are discussed as they would apply to a military operation.
