other granular applications where two flight lines were utilized
(Appendix C-l to C-6). The distribution patterns for the bromacil
synules and the Tandex 10G granules using the Transland unit approach-
ed the ideal trapezoidal form for a single swath. However, the sharply
vertical sides may pose some problem in swathing.
The Transland unit on loan was radio controlled; the manufacturer
has installed a direct electrical connection through the hook on later
models. Pilot training will be essential in using these units since
there is a lag of approximately 0.8 seconds between activation and the
opening and closing of the gate. Also, lighter materials such as
Tandex and synules tend to swirl in the fiberglass basket and spilled
over the edge in flight. This has been corrected in later models by
installing a cover.
The granular materials used varied widely in their physical
characteristics (Table 8). For soil-applied materials such as these,
the absorbing plant root must intercept the herbicide in the soil
solution. The soil area each particle must service (Table 8) varies
from 0.05 sq in for Tandex to 6.03 sq in for bromacil 10G. Further
judgements in this regard should be based upon the responses of the
treated vegetation.

The clay granules did not cause any of the problems which were
encountered in Allied and Transland equipment with the Tandex on a
sand-core. The fall application of Tandex on a coated clay granule
generated considerable dust at the point of release (Figure 8).
Delivery of Tandex from the Swathmaster varied more from the pre-
scribed rate than did other materials. Although many herbicides are
applied on clay granules, representatives of Niagara maintain that a
clay granule will endanger the viability of the Tandex material.
