ABSTRACT
Bromacil and Tandex were applied to one-acre plots as
granules and as sprays using rotary-wing aircraft, and as
granules using fixed-wing aircraft. Granular materials
were applied at rates ranging from 11 to 200 Ibs/A. Spray
volumes ranged from 10 to 40 gal/A.
The spray volumes dispensed did not differ more than
five percent from scheduled amounts, but the output of
granular materials was more variable. The greatest diffi-
culty in delivery was encountered with granules formed on
a sand core. Individual sand grains interferred with the
proper operation of gates in the rotary-wing distributors.
Also, the variation between scheduled and measured deliv-
ery of granules from rotary-wing equipment was greatest
when less than 25 Ib/A was applied, indicating a need
for a less sensitive gate design.
Distribution of applied materials was measured by
collecting samples of granules for weighing or samples
of dyed spray for colorimetric determination. Generally,
the distribution patterns were satisfactory.
The characteristics of each type of aircraft and the
different forms of materials are discussed as they would
apply to a military operation.
