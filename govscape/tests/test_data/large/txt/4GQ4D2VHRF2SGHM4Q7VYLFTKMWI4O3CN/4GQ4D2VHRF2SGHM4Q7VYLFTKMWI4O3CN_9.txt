Both rotary-wing contractors used Bell, Model 47D1, helicopters.
The Allied unit was fitted with a granular distribution system fab-
ricated in their own shop (Figure 3). In this system granular
material was fed from both straddle tanks through pre-set gates into
the center of a centrifugal spreader. This spreader consisted of
upper and lower plates separated by curved vanes.
The distributor for the spring application was a Sling-King unit
furnished by Transland Aircraft Inc. of Harbor City, California. This
unit was suspended beneath the helicopter furnished by Boyl using a
hook and sling arrangement (Figure 4). It consisted of an open fiber-
glass hopper with an internal adjustable gate arrangement which dumped
directly onto a spinning disc fitted with four vanes.
The granule/pellet materials were applied with fixed-wing air-
craft on October 29-30, 1968 and on April 1, 1969. The distribution
patterns and swath widths for the various materials were checked at
College Station, Texas prior to the actual application. Releasing the
material 30 feet above the ground with the ship traveling at 80 mph
ground speed gave a swath approximately 40 feet wide. The gate open-
ing was established during application. The initial spacing was based
on the experience of the operator with materials having particles of
similar size and density, and was adjusted during the operation. The
Cuero Airport, ten miles west, of the experimental location, was used
for landing and loading the fixed-wing aircraft.
The fall treatments using rotary-wing equipment were made October
30-31, 1968, except the Tandex 10G material on a sand-core. Individu-
al sand grains interferred with the proper operation of the release
gate assembly, and the treatment was applied December 4, 1968 using a
clay granule. Spring treatments were applied April 18-19, 1969.
The flow rate for each granular material was established on the
ground by adjusting the gate opening to deliver a specified amount of
material during a prescribed time interval (Figure 3). The pilot for
Allied, by flying at an altitude of 20 ft, a ground speed of 40 mph,
and turning the spreader at 750 rpm, applied the lower rate of each
material to an effective swath of 40 feet. Higher rates were achieved
by flying each swath twice.
The Transland distributor (Figure 4) was powered by an auxilary
3 HP gasoline motor. A radio signal in the aircraft accelerated the
auxilary motor, which in turn actuated a centrifugal clutch to raise
the covering sleeve on the gate a pre-set distance. A swath 80 ft
wide was achieved by releasing the material at an altitude of 30 ft
and a ground speed of 30 mph with the plate spinning at 1750 rpm.
The rotary-wing aircraft also were used to apply spray materials
(Figure 5). Fall spray applications were scheduled at volumes of 10
and 20 gal/A (1 gal/1 Ib ai), and the spring treatments inadvertently
were applied at twice these volumes.
