Recovery of a smaller amount of the tracer dye from the spring appli-
cation compared with that from the previous fall treatment may have
been due in part to the extremely heavy dew which formed on and ran
off the collection plates prior to treatment. Failure to recover a
large proportion of spray material released from aircraft is not un-
usual; most engineering studies expect to recover only 40-60 percent
of the released material.
Gate openings on the Swathmaster for each material are shown in
Figure 7. The delivered rate of granular material varied from the
scheduled rate less than 10 percent in nearly one-half of the appli-
cations (Tables 4-7). In only two cases, both involving Tandex 10G
granules, was the variance greater than 44 percent. In the case of
the fall application using the fixed-wing aircraft, the plot receiv-
ing the extreme overdose of Tandex 10G (Table 4) was the first load
of material flown.
The extreme overrun with Tandex 10G on the fall application using
rotary-wing aircraft probably reflects the difficulty encountered in
the gate mechanism with the sand-core material. There may have been
some pneumatic (venturi) influence on small granules with the Allied
distributor. Further adjustment of the gate setting was needed after
the first flight with finer but not with coarser material. The re-
maining Tandex treatments for the fall application were applied
using clay granules supplied by the manufacturer (Figure 8).
The greatest problem in delivery seemed to be the metering of
the synules by the two distributors used with the rotary-wing air-
craft, although the fixed-wing ship had no problem. This is seen as
a mechanical problem requiring the installation of a saw-tooth baffle
or other critical metering mechanism to render the gate adjustment
less sensitive. Flying at a faster speed so long as the distribution
pattern is not affected adversely is another alternative.
The amount of granular material recovered relative to the amount
delivered varied widely and was considerably below the standards set
by Chamberlin and Young (1956). Using sample collectors having
vertical sides 3 inches high they were able to account for more than
90 percent of the known discharge. The muslin panels (Figure 6) used
in these applications to sample granule distribution were taut enough
in most cases that some of the granules bounced off on impact.
Crosswinds having a velocity of 5 mph or greater appeared to
displace the distribution pattern laterally (Appendix C-3, C-5, C-9).
Some distortion of the pattern occurred when the aircraft traveled
into and with the wind in applying a light rate of Tandex G, but this
distortion was not so evident at the higher rate of application
(Appendix C-6).
Some comparisons can be made of the distribution patterns obtain-
ed with the Transland distributor used in the spring helicopter
applications down a single flight line (Appendix C-8; C-9) with the
