Appendix B3. Fordtran loamy fine sand
(64) Fordtran loamy fine sand
This soil is a member of the clayey, mixed, thermic family of Aernic
Albaqualfs. It consists of thick grayish brown loamy fine sand A
horizons and mottled sandy clay Bt horizons.
A representative profile (moist) is:
Al 0 to 14 inches, dark grayish brown loamy fine sand; weak
granular structure; plentiful fine roots; slightly acid;
clear boundary.
A2 14 to 21 inches, grayish brown loamy fine sand without soil
structure; contains a few small chert gravel; slightly acid;
abrupt wavy boundary.
B21t 21 to 27 inches, dark grayish brown sandy clay with common
medium distinct yellowish brown and strong brown mottles;
moderate medium blocky soil structure; continuous coatings
on natural clods; medium acid; contains a few fine chert
gravel; clear boundary.
B22t 27 to 38 inches, light brownish gray sandy clay with many
coarse distinct yellowish brown and a few medium strong
brown mottles; continuous coating on the natural clods;
slightly acid; gradual boundary.
B3t 38 to 62 inches, gray sandy clay with a few, fine strong
brown mottles; it has weak blocky structure.
C 62 to 96 inches, dark yellowish brown light sandy clay with
a few medium faint light brownish gray mottles; structure-
less; slightly acid.
Where this soil occurs in the lower valleys, the A horizon is a heavy
loamy fine sand and the Bt horizon has less mottling. These areas
remain wet longer. During the wet season, a perched water table lays
on the Bt horizon and causes it to be boggy.
Native vegetation is brownseed paspalum, some bermudagrass and some
scrubby live oak trees.
