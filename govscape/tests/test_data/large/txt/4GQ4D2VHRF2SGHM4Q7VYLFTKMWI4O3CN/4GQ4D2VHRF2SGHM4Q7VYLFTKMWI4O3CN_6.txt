DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF SELECTED
HERBICIDES APPLIED USING AERIAL EQUIPMENT
Wayne G. McCully and Charles W. Robinson
Aerial equipment can be fitted with distributors for applying
herbicides having a wide range of physical characteristics. Liquid
sprays, as well as dry materials fashioned into granules or pellets
of varying size and configuration, have been distributed from air-
craft in flight. The widespread use of various types of aircraft in
military operations offers a ready source of transport for applying
herbicides to a target vegetation.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of aircraft over ground equipment
for distributing herbicides is the facility with which large areas can
be treated relatively quickly. This rapid dissemination of material
does not lessen the need for accurate placement of herbicide over the
area being treated. The response of target vegetation to the applied
herbicide may vary considerably with seemingly small variations in
amount of material intercepted. The relatively high herbicidal
activity of materials presently in use, compared with older materials,
demands precise application for most efficient control of vegetation.
This project, "Aerial Test Evaluation of Soil-Applied Herbicides,"
was activated 1968 July 1. The objective of this phase of the study
was to assess the depositional patterns of liquid and granule/pellet
formulations in aerial applications by available dissemination systems
used in the test program. Subsequent work will evaluate plant re-
sponse to the applied herbicides, determine the rate of dissipation
for the herbicides, and assess the relative effectiveness of liquid
and granule/pellet formulations.
PROCEDURE
This study was organized to compare the relative effectiveness of
two herbicides, bromacil and Tandex,* for controlling perennial grasses
and associated woody and herbaceous plants. The herbicides were
applied in liquid and dry form using both fixed- and rotary-wing air-
craft. Phase I of this study consisted of securing and organizing the
experimental area, and applying specified herbicides.
