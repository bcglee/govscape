as sprays of wettable powders (WP) required a volume of 1 gal of water
per Ib (ai) of herbicide. Emulsifiable concentrate (EC) forms applied
undiluted would treat four times the area/load than would WP, using
the materials in this test.
The only real problem involved granular Tandex coated on a sand
core. Individual sand grains rendered the Allied sliding gate inoper-
able. They prevented the covering sleeve on the Transland unit from
closing completely, causing it to leak material. This material also
was the most erratic of the three distributed through the Swathmaster
unit. Also, units accommodating the sand-core material would be sub-
ject to accelerated wear from sand abrasion.
It may be concluded from this study that soil-applied herbicides
may be distributed either dry or as sprays. Distribution systems for
either type of material are available, but some additional engineering
studies involving granular distributors probably are warranted.
