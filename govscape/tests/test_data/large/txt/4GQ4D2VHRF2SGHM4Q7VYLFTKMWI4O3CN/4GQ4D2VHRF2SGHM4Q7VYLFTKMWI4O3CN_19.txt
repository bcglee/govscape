SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Precision in the placement of an herbicide is necessary for effi-
cient biological action of the applied material. Too little material
gives disappointing results, and too much may not only be wasteful but
generate undesirable side effects. Both rotary- and fixed-wing air-
craft have been used to dispense herbicides in agricultural operations.
Since both of these types of aircraft are commonly used in military
operations they could easily be fitted to distribute biological agents.
Within limits, the pattern of distribution for either a single or
multiple swath obtained with material distributed from aircraft depends
upon the height of release above the target surface, the density of the
individual particles, the aircraft velocity, mechanical characteristics
of the herbicide distributor and certain atomspheric conditions such
as wind direction and velocity. Some distance between the aircraft and
the target surface is desirable for safety and to take advantage of
aerodynamic factors in distributing the herbicide particles, but the
risk of particle displacement increases with greater height.
Liquid and granular forms of bromacil and Tandex were applied us-
ing fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft to an area of mixed grass-brush
vegetation near Cuero, Texas. Duplicate 1-acre plots were treated
during fall 1968 and spring 1969 using 10 and 20 pounds of material
(ai) per acre. The amount of material dispensed was measured at the
landing site, and distribution within the treated plots was determined
on two lines transverse to the direction of flight. Dye added to the
spray mixture was determined colorimetrically from material intercepted
on mylar plates; granules deposited on cloth panels attached to wire
frames were collected and weighed.
The fixed-wing aircraft featured an internal tank and a standard
Swathmaster distributor mounted directly under the wing. The granular
distributors on the rotary-wing aircraft offered a comparison of an
internally-contained unit with one suspended beneath the ship. De-
tachable distributors, such as Transland, offer greater flexibility in
the use of assigned aircraft. An internally-contained unit, such as
Allied used, produces a minimum amount of drag compared with external
distributors employed by the other contractors. This increased drag
may increase power requirements with a possible reduction in speed and
maneuverability. Spray systems are available which do not require
outside mounting, or which produce a minimum of drag.
The amounts of spray dispensed were much more precise than were
the granular materials. Each of the three types of granular distrib-
utors applied the various materials in a satisfactory pattern over the
target area. If granules are to be dispensed at rates less than 25
Ib/A from aircraft flying at a ground speed of 40 mph, a more sensitive
metering design than a rectangular gate opening should be employed.
The volume of granular material used is a function of the rate
applied and the active ingredient content. Tandex and bromacil applied
