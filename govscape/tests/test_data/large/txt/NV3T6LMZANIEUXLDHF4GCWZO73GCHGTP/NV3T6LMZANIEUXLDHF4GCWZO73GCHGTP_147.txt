health and vigor of plants. Most soils in Douglas County have pH of more than 4.5
within a depth of 40 inches.
Ponding is a hazard in areas where the seasonal high water table is above the
surface. Ponding is standing water that is only removed by deep percolation or
evaporation (fig. 11). Duration of ponding is described as very brief, brief, long, or very
long. Ponding reduces aeration and increases nutrient losses. Soils in the survey area
that are affected by ponding are Brooklyn, Drummer, Harpster, Hartsburg, Milford,
Peotone, Sawmill, Sexton, and Zook soils.
Drainage systems have been installed in most areas of poorly drained and
somewhat poorly drained soils in the county. As a result, these soils are adequately
drained for the crops commonly grown in the area. Poorly drained soils, such as
Drummer and Hartsburg soils, commonly have subsurface drainage. In addition, some
areas of poorly drained soils require surface tile inlets or shallow surface ditches to
remove ponded water. Milford soils commonly have both tile drainage and surface
ditches, especially in the central part of Douglas County. Some areas of somewhat
poorly drained soils are occasionally wet long enough that artificial drainage is
required if productivity is to be maintained. Most areas of somewhat poorly drained
soils, such as Flanagan, Rutland, and Raub soils, have subsurface drainage.
Land grading helps to control ponding. Surface ditches and surface inlet tile also
help to remove excess water if suitable outlets are available. Management of drainage
in conformance with wetland regulations may require special permits and extra
planning.
Poor tilth is a limitation if (1) the content of clay in the surface layer is at least 27
percent but less than 35 percent and the content of organic matter is less than 4
percent, or (2) the content of clay is greater than or equal to 35 percent. Poor tilth can
occur in soils when part of the subsoil is incorporated into the plow layer, typically as a
result of the thinning of the surface layer by erosion. The incorporation of subsoil
material into the plow layer decreases the amount of organic matter and increases the
