Douglas County, Illinois 149
Forestland
When the first settlers arrived in the survey area, forests covered about 15.5
percent of the land (Iverson and others, 1989). Since then, most of the trees have
been cleared from areas that are most suitable for cultivation.
By 2002, only 2,901 acres, or about 1 percent of the acreage in Douglas County,
remained as forestland (USDA, NASS, 2002). Most of the forestland is privately
owned. The most common trees in the uplands are white oak, black oak, northern red
oak, shagbark hickory, white ash, green ash, sugar maple, silver maple, boxelder,
black walnut, black cherry, and American elm. The most common trees on flood plains
are cottonwood, sycamore, willow, bur oak, pin oak, swamp white oak, hackberry, and
silver maple.
The remaining forestland acres are predominantly in areas too steep, too wet, or
too isolated for cultivation. Most of these areas are along the drainageways of the
Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers. If they are properly managed, the soils in these
areas are well suited to producing high-quality trees.
The productivity of many of the remaining forestland stands could be improved with
proper management. Management practices needed in these areas include excluding
livestock from the stands; providing protection from fire, insects, and diseases; using
proper logging methods; and using proven silvicultural methods to enhance growth
and regeneration.
In table 10, the potential productivity of merchantable or common trees on a soil is
expressed as a site index and as a volume number. The site index is the average
height, in feet, that dominant and codominant trees of a given species attain in a
specified number of years. The site index applies to fully stocked, even-aged,
unmanaged stands. Commonly grown trees are those that forest managers generally
favor in intermediate or improvement cuttings. They are selected on the basis of
growth rate, quality, value, and marketability. More detailed information regarding site
index is available in the “National Forestry Manual” (USDA/NRCS, National Forestry
Manual), which is available in local offices of the Natural Resources Conservation
Service or on the Internet.
The volume of wood fiber, a number, is the yield likely to be produced by the most
important tree species. This number, expressed as cubic feet per acre per year and
calculated at the age of culmination of the mean annual increment (CMAI), indicates
the amount of fiber produced in a fully stocked, even-aged, unmanaged stand.
Suggested trees to plant are those preferred for planting, seeding, or natural
regeneration and those that remain in the stand after thinning or partial harvest.
Windbreaks and Environmental Plantings
Windbreaks protect livestock, buildings, yards, fruit trees, gardens, and cropland
from wind and snow; help to keep snow on fields; and provide food and cover for
wildlife. Wind erosion is a moderate hazard on about 12.5 percent of the soils in the
county. These soils have a surface layer of very fine sandy loam or sandy loam, have a
high content of finely divided calcium carbonate, or have a high content of clay in the
surface layer. Hartsburg soils generally have a high content of calcium carbonate in
the surface layer. Milford and Peotone soils have a high content of clay in the surface
layer.
Field windbreaks are narrow plantings made at right angles to the prevailing wind
and at specific intervals across the field. The interval depends on the erodibility of the
soil.
Environmental plantings help to beautify and screen houses and other buildings and
to abate noise. The plants, mostly evergreen shrubs and trees, are closely spaced. To
