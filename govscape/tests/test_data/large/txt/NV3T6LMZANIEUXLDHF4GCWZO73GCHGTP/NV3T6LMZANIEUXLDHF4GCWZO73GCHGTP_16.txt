Douglas County, Illinois 5
The relief in Douglas County is low on the nearly level and gently sloping, broad
uplands. The greatest change in relief is in areas along major drainageways, where
stream downcutting has caused 50- to 65-foot drops in elevation from the adjacent
uplands (fig. 4). The elevation in the county ranges from about 600 feet to about 720
feet above mean sea level. The highest elevation is near the village of Newman on the
West Ridge Moraine. The lowest elevation is where the Embarras River exits the
county southwest of Oakland.
The Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers drain most of the county. The Kaskaskia River
ultimately drains into the Mississippi River south of St. Louis. The Embarras flows into
the Wabash River, which then joins the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois.
The flood plains along these rivers and their tributaries are generally flooded annually,
and the soils in these areas often have a high seasonal water table. Because the
county has such low relief, ponding occurs on many soils.
Most areas are sufficiently drained for the commonly grown crops. Subsurface tile
drains have been installed in most of the fields, and an extensive system of drainage
ditches supplements the natural drainage.
Natural Resources
At the time of settlement, about 41,000 acres of the county was forestland (Iverson,
1989). In 2002, about 2,901 acres, or about 0.9 percent of the county, was forestland
and pasture forestland (USDA, NASS, 2002). The remaining forestland is typically
along the major streams and their tributaries. Much of this land is not tillable because
of the slope or the frequency of flooding and is maintained for conservation reasons. It
provides important areas of wildlife habitat (fig. 5).
The county has approximately 788 acres of impounded water, and most of this
water is in farm ponds. The Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers provide habitat and
opportunities for recreation. The county has another 288 acres of miscellaneous water
in the form of settling ponds and wastewater treatment ponds. These areas are not
typically considered useful for wildlife habitat or recreation.
The county has an abundant supply of ground water in the sand and gravel deposits
in buried valleys and in areas where glacial drift is thick. The municipal water supplies
and many rural areas depend on ground-water wells (Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency, 2005).
Excavations for sand and gravel along both the Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers are
identified on the soil maps as Pits, gravel.
Gravel, stone, and agricultural lime are quarried from an area just east of Tuscola
where limestone bedrock lies near the land surface. This area is identified on the soil
maps as Pits, quarries.
