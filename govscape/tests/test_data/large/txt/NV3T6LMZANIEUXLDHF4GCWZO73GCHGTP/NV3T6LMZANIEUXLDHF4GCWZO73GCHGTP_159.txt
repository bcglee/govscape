148 Soil Survey of
Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils
(NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long
enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part
(Federal Register, 1994). These soils, under natural conditions, are either saturated or
inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and
reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation.
The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with
wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil,
however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration
of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties
unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria
are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands.
The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in “Soil
Taxonomy” (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and “Keys to Soil Taxonomy” (Soil Survey Staff,
2003) and in the “Soil Survey Manual” (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993).
If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric,
they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These
visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite
determinations of hydric soils are specified in “Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the
United States” (Hurt and others, 2002).
Hydric soils are identified by examining and describing the soil to a depth of about
20 inches. This depth may be greater if determination of an appropriate indicator so
requires. It is always recommended that soils be excavated and described to the depth
necessary for an understanding of the redoximorphic processes. Then, using the
completed soil descriptions, soil scientists can compare the soil features required by
each indicator and specify which indicators have been matched with the conditions
observed in the soil. The soil can be identified as a hydric soil if at least one of the
approved indicators is present.
Map units that are dominantly made up of hydric soils may have small areas, or
inclusions, of nonhydric soils in the higher positions on the landform, and map units
dominantly made up of nonhydric soils may have inclusions of hydric soils in the lower
positions on the landform.
The criteria for hydric soils are represented by codes in the table (for example,
2B3). Definitions for the codes are as follows:
1. All Histels except for Folistels, and Histosols except for Folists.
2. Soils in Aquic suborders, great groups, or subgroups, Albolls suborder, Historthels
great group, Histoturbels great group, Pachic subgroups, or Cumulic subgroups
that:
A. are somewhat poorly drained and have a water table at the surface (0.0 feet)
during the growing season, or
B. are poorly drained or very poorly drained and have either:
1) a water table at the surface (0.0 feet) during the growing season if textures
are coarse sand, sand, or fine sand in all layers within a depth of 20
inches, or
2) a water table at a depth of 0.5 foot or less during the growing season if
permeability is equal to or greater than 6.0 in/hr in all layers within a depth
of 20 inches, or
3) a water table at a depth of 1.0 foot or less during the growing season if
permeability is less than 6.0 in/hr in any layer within a depth of 20 inches.
3. Soils that are frequently ponded for long or very long duration during the growing
season.
4. Soils that are frequently flooded for long or very long duration during the growing
season.
