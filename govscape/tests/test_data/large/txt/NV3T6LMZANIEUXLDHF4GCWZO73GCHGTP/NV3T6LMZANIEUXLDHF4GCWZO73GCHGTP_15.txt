Douglas County has a well developed system of roads. Federal and State highways
cross the county, including Interstate 57, U.S. Highways 36 and 45, and State
Highways 49, 130, and 133. Several county and township roads also provide important
transportation links. Most of the township and county roads are paved and follow
section lines. Three railroad mainlines intersect at Tuscola. Tuscola has a small airport
that services business and private aircraft.
Physiography, Relief, and Drainage
Douglas County lies entirely within the Bloomington Ridged Plain of the Central
Lowland physiographic province (Leighton and others, 1948). The Bloomington Ridged
Plain is part of the Wisconsinan till plain that is characterized by a series of end
moraines and ground moraines.
Douglas County also lies entirely within the Illinois and Iowa Deep Loess and Drift
major land resource area (MLRA 108). An MLRA is a geographic area that is
characterized by a particular pattern of soils, climate, water resources, and land use
(USDA, 2006).
Douglas County was covered by glaciers during the Pleistocene. Most of the
present surface materials and landforms are the result of glacial ice, running water,
and windblown deposits of the most recent glacial stage, the Wisconsinan. The
glaciers deposited from about 20 feet to more than 200 feet of drift throughout the
county (Willman and Frye, 1970). In most areas the drift was covered with as much as
5 feet of windblown silt, called loess. The central part of Douglas County is surrounded
by glacial moraines from different ice advances and retreats. The Arcola Moraine lies
to the south and west, and the Pesotum and West Ridge Moraines are to the north. A
large part of Douglas County was covered by a glacial lake between these moraines
(fig. 3).
