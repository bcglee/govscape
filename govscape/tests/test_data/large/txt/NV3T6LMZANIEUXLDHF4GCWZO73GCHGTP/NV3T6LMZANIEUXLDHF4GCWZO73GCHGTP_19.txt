While a soil survey is in progress, samples of some of the soils in the area generally
are collected for laboratory analyses and for engineering tests. Soil scientists interpret
the data from these analyses and tests as well as the field-observed characteristics
and the soil properties to determine the expected behavior of the soils under different
uses. Interpretations for all of the soils are field tested through observation of the soils
in different uses and under different levels of management. Some interpretations are
modified to fit local conditions, and some new interpretations are developed to meet
local needs. Data are assembled from other sources, such as research information,
production records, and field experience of specialists. For example, data on crop
yields under defined levels of management are assembled from farm records and from
field or plot experiments on the same kinds of soil.
Predictions about soil behavior are based not only on soil properties but also on
such variables as climate and biological activity. Soil conditions are predictable over
long periods of time, but they are not predictable from year to year. For example, soil
scientists can predict with a fairly high degree of accuracy that a given soil will have a
water table within certain depths in most years, but they cannot predict that a water
table will always be at a specific level in the soil on a specific date.
The soil survey information contained in this report was based on a review of field
notes, laboratory data, and other data collected during the previous soil survey of
Douglas County (Hallbick and Fehrenbacher, 1971). In addition, data from other soil
surveys within MLRA 108 were reviewed. Reviewing data on a regional basis allows
for improved consistency in the identification, classification, and interpretations of soils
on similar landscapes.
Aerial photographs used in this survey were taken in 1998 and 1999. Soil scientists
also studied U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps (enlarged to a scale of
1:12,000) and ortho-photographs to relate land and image features. Specific soil
boundaries were drawn on the ortho-photographs. Adjustments of soil boundary lines
were made to coincide with the U.S. Geological Survey topographic map contour lines
and tonal patterns on aerial photographs.
