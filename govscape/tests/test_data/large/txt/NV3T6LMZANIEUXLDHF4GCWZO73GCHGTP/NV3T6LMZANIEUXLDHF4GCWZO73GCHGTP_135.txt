533—Urban land
(cid:127) This map unit occurs as areas that are covered by pavement and buildings. Because
of extensive land smoothing, the areas are generally nearly level or gently sloping.
Most of the paved areas are parking lots adjacent to shopping centers, industrial
plants, and other commercial buildings.
W—Water
(cid:127) This map unit includes streams, lakes, ponds, and estuaries. These areas are
covered with water in most years, at least during the period that is warm enough for
