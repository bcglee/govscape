192 Soil Survey of
Siltstone. An indurated silt having the texture and composition of shale but lacking its
fine lamination or fissility; a massive mudstone in which silt predominates over
clay.
Similar soils. Soils that share limits of diagnostic criteria, behave and perform in a
similar manner, and have similar conservation needs or management
requirements for the major land uses in the survey area.
Site index. A designation of the quality of a forest site based on the height of the
dominant stand at an arbitrarily chosen age. For example, if the average height
attained by dominant and codominant trees in a fully stocked stand at the age of
50 years is 75 feet, the site index is 75.
Slickensides (pedogenic). Grooved, striated, and/or glossy (shiny) slip faces on
structural peds, such as wedges; produced by shrink-swell processes, most
commonly in soils that have a high content of expansive clays.
Slope. The inclination of the land surface from the horizontal. Percentage of slope is
the vertical distance divided by horizontal distance, then multiplied by 100. Thus, a
slope of 20 percent is a drop of 20 feet in 100 feet of horizontal distance. In this
survey, classes for simple slopes are as follows:
Nearly level...........................................0 to 2 percent
Gently sloping...................................... 2 to 5 percent
Strongly sloping..................................5 to 10 percent
Moderately steep..............................10 to 18 percent
Steep.................................................18 to 35 percent
Very steep................................35 percent and higher
Slope alluvium. Sediment gradually transported down the slopes of mountains or hills
primarily by nonchannel alluvial processes (i.e., slope-wash processes) and
characterized by particle sorting. Lateral particle sorting is evident on long slopes.
In a profile sequence, sediments may be distinguished by differences in size
and/or specific gravity of rock fragments and may be separated by stone lines.
Burnished peds and sorting of rounded or subrounded pebbles or cobbles
distinguish these materials from unsorted colluvial deposits.
Sloughed till. Water-saturated till that has flowed slowly downhill from its original
place of deposit by glacial ice. It may rest on other till, on outwash, or on a
glaciolacustrine deposit.
Slow refill (in tables). The slow filling of ponds, resulting from restricted permeability in
the soil.
Soft bedrock. Bedrock that can be excavated with trenching machines, backhoes,
small rippers, and other equipment commonly used in construction.
Soil. A natural, three-dimensional body at the earthâ€™s surface. It is capable of
supporting plants and has properties resulting from the integrated effect of climate
and living matter acting on earthy parent material, as conditioned by relief and by
the passage of time.
Soil separates. Mineral particles less than 2 millimeters in equivalent diameter and
ranging between specified size limits. The names and sizes, in millimeters, of
separates recognized in the United States are as follows:
Very coarse sand ........................................2.0 to 1.0
Coarse sand................................................1.0 to 0.5
Medium sand.............................................0.5 to 0.25
Fine sand.................................................0.25 to 0.10
Very fine sand..........................................0.10 to 0.05
Silt..........................................................0.05 to 0.002
Clay.....................................................less than 0.002
