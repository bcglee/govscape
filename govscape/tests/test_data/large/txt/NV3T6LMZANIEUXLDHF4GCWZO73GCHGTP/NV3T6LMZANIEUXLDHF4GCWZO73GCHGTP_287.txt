276 Soil Survey of
Table 16a.--Construction Materials
(The information in this table indicates the dominant soil condition but does not eliminate the
need for onsite investigation. The numbers in the value columns range from 0.00 to 0.99. The
smaller the value, the greater the limitation. See text for further explanation of ratings in
this table)
