Douglas County, Illinois 183
Hard to reclaim (in tables). Reclamation is difficult after the removal of soil for
construction and other uses. Revegetation and erosion control are extremely
difficult.
Hardpan. A hardened or cemented soil horizon, or layer. The soil material is sandy,
loamy, or clayey and is cemented by iron oxide, silica, calcium carbonate, or other
substance.
Head slope (geomorphology). A geomorphic component of hills consisting of a
laterally concave area of a hillside, especially at the head of a drainageway. The
overland waterflow is converging.
Hemic soil material (mucky peat). Organic soil material intermediate in degree of
decomposition between the less decomposed fibric material and the more
decomposed sapric material.
Henry Formation (geology). Consists of stratified sand and gravel that occur above
the Sangamon Geosol.
High-residue crops. Such crops as small grain and corn used for grain. If properly
managed, residue from these crops can be used to control erosion until the next
crop in the rotation is established. These crops return large amounts of organic
matter to the soil.
Hill. A generic term for an elevated area of the land surface, rising as much as 1,000
feet above surrounding lowlands, commonly of limited summit area and having a
well defined outline. Slopes are generally more than 15 percent. The distinction
between a hill and a mountain is arbitrary and may depend on local usage.
Hillslope. A generic term for the steeper part of a hill between its summit and the
drainage line, valley flat, or depression floor at the base of a hill.
Holocene (geology). Postglacial age or time period (interglacial). About 0 to 12,600
years before present. See Quaternary.
Horizon, soil. A layer of soil, approximately parallel to the surface, having distinct
characteristics produced by soil-forming processes. In the identification of soil
horizons, an uppercase letter represents the major horizons. Numbers or
lowercase letters that follow represent subdivisions of the major horizons. An
explanation of the subdivisions is given in the “Soil Survey Manual.” The major
horizons of mineral soil are as follows:
O horizon.—An organic layer of fresh and decaying plant residue.
L horizon.—A layer of organic and mineral limnic materials, including coprogenous
earth (sedimentary peat), diatomaceous earth, and marl.
A horizon.—The mineral horizon at or near the surface in which an accumulation
of humified organic matter is mixed with the mineral material. Also, a plowed
surface horizon, most of which was originally part of a B horizon.
E horizon.—The mineral horizon in which the main feature is loss of silicate clay,
iron, aluminum, or some combination of these.
B horizon.—The mineral horizon below an A horizon. The B horizon is in part a
layer of transition from the overlying A to the underlying C horizon. The B horizon
also has distinctive characteristics, such as (1) accumulation of clay, sesquioxides,
humus, or a combination of these; (2) prismatic or blocky structure; (3) redder or
browner colors than those in the A horizon; or (4) a combination of these.
C horizon.—The mineral horizon or layer, excluding indurated bedrock, that is little
affected by soil-forming processes and does not have the properties typical of the
overlying soil material. The material of a C horizon may be either like or unlike that
in which the solum formed. If the material is known to differ from that in the solum,
an Arabic numeral, commonly a 2, precedes the letter C.
Cr horizon.—Soft, consolidated bedrock beneath the soil.
R layer.—Consolidated bedrock beneath the soil. The bedrock commonly
underlies a C horizon, but it can be directly below an A or a B horizon.
