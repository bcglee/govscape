Camp areas require site preparation, such as shaping and leveling the tent and
parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary
facilities and utility lines. Camp areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some
vehicular traffic. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the ease of
developing camp areas and the performance of the areas after development. Slope,
stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns affecting
the development of camp areas. The soil properties that affect the performance of the
areas after development are those that influence trafficability and promote the growth
of vegetation, especially in heavily used areas. For good trafficability, the surface of
camp areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not
be dusty when dry. The soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the
surface layer, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, permeability, and large stones.
The soil properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented
pan, permeability, and toxic substances in the soil.
Picnic areas are subject to heavy foot traffic. Most vehicular traffic is confined to
access roads and parking areas. The ratings are based on the soil properties that
affect the ease of developing picnic areas and that influence trafficability and the
growth of vegetation after development. Slope and stoniness are the main concerns
affecting the development of picnic areas. For good trafficability, the surface of picnic
areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be
dusty when dry. The soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface
layer, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, permeability, and large stones. The soil
properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan,
permeability, and toxic substances in the soil.
Playgrounds require soils that are nearly level, are free of stones, and can
withstand intensive foot traffic. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect
the ease of developing playgrounds and that influence trafficability and the growth of
vegetation after development. Slope and stoniness are the main concerns affecting the
development of playgrounds. For good trafficability, the surface of the playgrounds
should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty
when dry. The soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer,
depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, permeability, and large stones. The soil
properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan,
permeability, and toxic substances in the soil.
Paths and trails for hiking and horseback riding should require little or no slope
modification through cutting and filling. The ratings are based on the soil properties
that affect trafficability and erodibility. These properties are stoniness, depth to a water
table, ponding, flooding, slope, and texture of the surface layer.
Off-road motorcycle trails require little or no site preparation. They are not covered
with surfacing material or vegetation. Considerable compaction of the soil material is
likely. The ratings are based on the soil properties that influence erodibility, trafficability,
dustiness, and the ease of revegetation. These properties are stoniness, slope, depth
to a water table, ponding, flooding, and texture of the surface layer.
Golf fairways are subject to heavy foot traffic and some light vehicular traffic. Cutting
or filling may be required. Irrigation is not considered in the ratings. The ratings are
based on the soil properties that affect plant growth and trafficability after vegetation is
established. The properties that affect plant growth are reaction; depth to a water table;
ponding; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; the available water capacity in the
upper 40 inches; the content of salts, sodium, or calcium carbonate; and sulfidic
materials. The properties that affect trafficability are flooding, depth to a water table,
ponding, slope, stoniness, and the amount of sand, clay, or organic matter in the
