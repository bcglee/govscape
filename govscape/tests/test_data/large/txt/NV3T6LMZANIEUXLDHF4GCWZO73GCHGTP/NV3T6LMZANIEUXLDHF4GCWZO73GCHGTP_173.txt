or depth of standing water if the soil is subject to ponding; slope; susceptibility to
flooding; subsidence of organic layers; and the potential for frost action. Excavating,
grading, and the stability of ditchbanks are affected by depth to bedrock, large stones,
slope, and the hazard of cutbanks caving. The productivity of the soil after drainage is
adversely affected by extreme acidity or by toxic substances in the root zone, such as
salts, sodium, and sulfur. Availability of drainage outlets is not considered in the
ratings.
Sprinkler irrigation is the controlled application of water to supplement rainfall and
support plant growth. The design and management of an irrigation system are affected
by depth to the water table, the need for drainage, flooding, available water capacity,
intake rate, permeability, erosion hazard, and slope. The construction of a system is
affected by large stones and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan. The performance of
a system is affected by the depth of the root zone, the amount of salts or sodium, and
soil reaction.
