Douglas County, Illinois 145
The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers,
conservationists, and extension agents (Olsen and others, 2000a and 2000b).
Available yield data from nearby counties and results of field trials and demonstrations
also are considered.
The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops
depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion
control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable
high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant
diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop
residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the
smallest possible loss.
Pasture yields are expressed in terms of animal unit months. An animal unit month
(AUM) is the amount of forage required by one mature cow of approximately 1,000
pounds weight, with or without a calf, for 1 month.
The estimated yields reflect the productive capacity of each soil for each of the
principal crops. Yields are likely to increase as new production technology is
developed. The productivity of a given soil compared with that of other soils, however,
is not likely to change.
Crops other than those shown in the yields tables are grown in the survey area, but
estimated yields are not listed because the acreage of such crops is small. The local
office of the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the Cooperative Extension
Service can provide information about the management and productivity of the soils
for those crops.
