faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt coats on faces of peds; common medium
faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; common fine
rounded black (10YR 2/1) weakly cemented iron-manganese oxide nodules
throughout; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films and common faint light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) silt coats on faces of peds; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR
5/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; many fine rounded black (10YR
2/1) weakly cemented iron-manganese oxide nodules throughout; very strongly
acid; clear smooth boundary.

channels and pores; common coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and
common coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation
in the matrix; common fine rounded black (10YR 2/1) weakly cemented iron-
manganese oxide nodules throughout; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.
2BC—35 to 40 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy loam; weak coarse
prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; friable; few medium

sandy clay loam; massive; friable; few medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; few fine rounded black (10YR 2/1) weakly
cemented iron-manganese oxide nodules throughout; slightly acid; abrupt smooth
boundary.
