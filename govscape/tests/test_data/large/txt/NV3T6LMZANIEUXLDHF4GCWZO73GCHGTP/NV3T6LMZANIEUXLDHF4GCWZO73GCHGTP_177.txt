10kPa tension) and oven dryness. The volume change is reported in the table as
percent change for the whole soil. Volume change is influenced by the amount and
type of clay minerals in the soil.
Linear extensibility is used to determine the shrink-swell potential of soils. The
shrink-swell potential is low if the soil has a linear extensibility of less than 3 percent;
moderate if 3 to 6 percent; high if 6 to 9 percent; and very high if more than 9 percent.
If the linear extensibility is more than 3, shrinking and swelling can cause damage to
buildings, roads, and other structures and to plant roots. Special design commonly is
needed.
Organic matter is the plant and animal residue in the soil at various stages of
decomposition. In table 19, the estimated content of organic matter is expressed as a
percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 millimeters in diameter.
The content of organic matter in a soil can be maintained by returning crop residue
to the soil. Organic matter has a positive effect on available water capacity, water
infiltration, soil organism activity, and tilth. It is a source of nitrogen and other nutrients
for crops and soil organisms.
Erosion factors are shown in table 19 as the K factor (Kw and Kf) and the T factor.
Erosion factor K indicates the susceptibility of a soil to sheet and rill erosion by water.
Factor K is one of six factors used in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and the
Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to predict the average annual rate of
soil loss by sheet and rill erosion in tons per acre per year. The estimates are based
primarily on percentage of silt, sand, and organic matter and on soil structure and
permeability. Values of K range from 0.02 to 0.69. Other factors being equal, the higher
the value, the more susceptible the soil is to sheet and rill erosion by water.
Erosion factor Kw indicates the erodibility of the whole soil. The estimates are
modified by the presence of rock fragments.
Erosion factor Kf indicates the erodibility of the fine-earth fraction, or the material
less than 2 millimeters in size.
Erosion factor T is an estimate of the maximum average annual rate of soil erosion
by wind or water that can occur without affecting crop productivity over a sustained
period. The rate is in tons per acre per year.
Wind erodibility groups are made up of soils that have similar properties affecting
their susceptibility to wind erosion in cultivated areas. The soils assigned to group 1
are the most susceptible to wind erosion, and those assigned to group 8 are the least
susceptible. The groups are described in the “National Soil Survey Handbook”
(USDA/NRCS, National Soil Survey Handbook).
Wind erodibility index is a numerical value indicating the susceptibility of soil to wind
erosion, or the tons per acre per year that can be expected to be lost to wind erosion.
There is a close correlation between wind erosion and the texture of the surface layer,
the size and durability of surface clods, rock fragments, organic matter, and a
calcareous reaction. Soil moisture and frozen soil layers also influence wind erosion.
Chemical Properties
Table 20 shows estimates of some chemical characteristics and features that affect
soil behavior. These estimates are given for the layers of each soil in the survey area.
The estimates are based on field observations and on test data for these and similar
soils.
Depth to the upper and lower boundaries of each layer is indicated.
Cation-exchange capacity is the total amount of extractable bases that can be held
by the soil, expressed in terms of milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil at neutrality
(pH 7.0) or at some other stated pH value. Soils having a low cation-exchange
capacity hold fewer cations and may require more frequent applications of fertilizer
