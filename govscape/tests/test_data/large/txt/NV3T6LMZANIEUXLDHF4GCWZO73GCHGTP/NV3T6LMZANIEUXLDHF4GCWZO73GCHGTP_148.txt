clay content in the surface soil. Poor tilth also occurs in poorly drained soils that have a
high clay content, regardless of organic matter content, and in soils that have been
excessively tilled. Soils with poor tilth generally have a surface layer that is sticky when
wet and hard and cloddy when dry. Because they can be tilled only within a narrow
range of moisture content, seedbed preparation is difficult. Poor tilth inhibits seedling
germination and emergence, increases runoff and erosion, and reduces the rate of
water infiltration. Clods make it difficult to prepare a good seedbed. Sloping fields
commonly have clayey spots where the subsoil is exposed. Preparing a good seedbed
and tilling are difficult in these areas because the original friable surface layer has
been lost through erosion.
Soils with good tilth are granular and porous and have a high content of organic
matter in the surface layer. Dana, Flanagan, and Catlin soils commonly have good tilth.
Soils that have poor tilth generally have more clay, a lower content of organic matter,
and weaker soil structure in the surface layer. Milford, Peotone, and Zook soils have
poor tilth. If these soils are plowed when too wet, they become cloddy.
Practices that improve tilth protect the surface from the impact of raindrops and
flowing water. Incorporating green manure crops, manure, or crop residue into the soil
and using a system of conservation tillage improve tilth. Regularly returning crop
residue to the soil, adding other organic material to the soil, minimizing tillage, and
timing conservation tillage operations to near optimal soil moisture conditions can
improve tilth. Surface cloddiness can be controlled by avoiding tillage when the soil is
too wet or by using no-till methods.
Restricted permeability occurs when the soil has a layer within a depth of 40 inches
in which permeability is very slow or slow. Permeability less than 0.2 inch per hour or
less than 1.4 micrometers per second is the criterion used for this interpretation.
Permeability is the quality of the soil that enables water or air to move through it.
Permeability affects interpretations for irrigation and drainage systems and
conservation management structures and plantings. Soils with slowly permeable or
very slowly permeable layers, such as Brooklyn and Sexton soils, have a higher
potential for surface runoff and drain more slowly than more permeable soils.
A root-restrictive layer is a limitation if dense material, a natric horizon, bedrock, or
a fragipan is within 40 inches of the surface. A root-restrictive layer can increase the
susceptibility of the soil to erosion and can limit the effectiveness of drainage systems.
Root-restrictive layers affect plant growth by limiting nutrients and available water.
Examples of soils with root-restrictive layers are Mona and Octagon soils.
A combination of conservation measures, including special tillage practices,
incorporation of organic material, and crop selection, can help to overcome this
limitation.
Water erosion is a hazard in areas of cropland if the erosion factor (Kw) multiplied
by the percent slope is greater than 0.8 and the slope is greater than or equal to 3
percent. Water erosion can occur if the surface soil is not protected against the impact
of raindrops. Erosion leads to a reduction in soil aggregate stability, which reduces the
rate of water infiltration and increases the rate of surface runoff (Brady, 1984). Soils
with long or steep slopes are more susceptible than other soils to water erosion. Sheet
and rill erosion is a hazard in areas where slopes are more than 2 percent or in areas
where slopes are longer or are subject to concentrated flow. Excessive runoff leads to
a decrease in surface water quality through sedimentation and contamination by
agricultural chemicals attached to soil particles in the sediment. Sediment enters
streams, rivers, water impoundments, and road ditches. Water erosion is a hazard on
about 8 percent of the total land area in the county. Dana, Senachwine, and Octagon
soils are examples of soils that are subject to water erosion.
Erosion can be controlled by a conservation tillage system that leaves crop residue
on the surface after planting or by a cropping system that rotates grasses and
legumes in the cropping sequence. On soils with long, uniform slopes, contour farming
