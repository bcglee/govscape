erosion when the soils are partially frozen because reduced infiltration results in more
water running off the surface.
Plant and Animal Life
Soils are greatly affected by the type of vegetation under which they formed. The
chief contribution of vegetation and biological processes to soil formation is the
addition of organic material and nitrogen. The amount of organic material in the soil
depends primarily on the kind of native plants that grew there. Decayed remains of
plants on or below the surface eventually become organic matter, or humus. Roots of
the plants provide channels for the downward movement of water through the soil and
add organic matter as they decay.
The native vegetation in Douglas County since the Wisconsinan Stage has
consisted primarily of tall prairie grasses and, to a lesser extent, deciduous
hardwoods. At the time of early settlement, about 84.5 percent of the county supported
prairie vegetation (Iverson, 1989). These grasses have many fibrous roots that
contribute large amounts of organic matter to the soil, especially where they are
concentrated near the surface. Soils that formed under prairie vegetation typically have
a thick, black or dark brown surface layer. They generally are in areas of low relief
relatively undissected by drainageways. Catlin, Drummer, and Flanagan soils are
examples.
About 15.5 percent of the county supported forest vegetation at the time of early
settlement (Iverson, 1989). Because the root systems of deciduous hardwoods are
less fibrous than those of grasses and are concentrated more at the surface, the
organic matter that they contribute to soil is mainly in the form of leaf litter.
Consequently, soils that formed under forest vegetation have a thinner and lighter
colored surface layer than that of prairie soils. Sabina, Senachwine, and Xenia soils
formed under forest vegetation. They are on summits and on backslopes along
drainageways.
