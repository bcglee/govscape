Douglas County, Illinois 139
Proper grazing is essential for the production of high-quality forage, stand survival,
and erosion control. It helps plants maintain sufficient and vigorous top growth during
the growing season. Brush control is essential in many areas, and weed control is
generally needed. Rotation grazing, deferred grazing during wet periods, and proper
applications of lime and fertilizer also are important management practices.
Management concerns affecting the use of the detailed soil map units in the survey
area for pasture are shown in table 6. The main concerns in managing pastureland in
Douglas County are equipment limitations, flooding, frost heave, high pH, limited
available water capacity, low fertility, low pH, ponding, poor tilth, root-restrictive layers,
water erosion, and wetness.
Equipment limitations occur if the slope is more than 18 percent. They can cause
rapid wear of equipment and can present problems with fertilization, harvest, pasture
renovation, and seedbed preparation. The use of equipment is limited in moderately
steep and steep areas of Senachwine soils.
Flooding applies to any map unit that is subject to occasional or frequent flooding.
Flooding occurs in unprotected areas along major rivers and their tributaries. Surface
drainage ditches help to remove floodwater if suitable outlets are available. Flooding
may damage pasture plants in some years. Medway, Shaffton, Sawmill, and Zook soils
are subject to flooding.
Selecting forage and hay varieties adapted to a shorter growing season and wetter
conditions reduces the extent of flood damage. Dikes and diversions can help to
minimize the extent of damage resulting from frequent or occasional flooding.
Restricted use during wet periods helps to keep the pasture in good condition.
Management of drainage in conformance with wetland regulations may require special
permits and extra planning.
Frost heave is a concern when the potential for frost action is moderate or high and
the drainage class is poorly drained or very poorly drained. Frost heave occurs in soils
when ice lenses or bands develop into or push an ice wedge between layers of soil
near the surface. The ice wedges heave the overlying soil layer upward, snapping plant
roots. Soils with textures low in sand have small pores that hold water and enable ice
lenses to form. Drummer, Hartsburg, Milford, Peotone, and Sawmill soils are
susceptible to frost heave.
Selecting adapted forage and hay varieties can reduce the effects of frost heave.
Timely rotation of grazing maintains a protective cover on the surface and insulates
the soil, thereby reducing the effects of frost heave. Maintaining stubble 4 to 6 inches
high and using mixtures of grasses and legumes can also help to prevent frost heave.
High pH is a limitation if the pH of the soil above a depth of 40 inches is greater
than or equal to 7.4. This limitation can create toxicity or reduce the availability of plant
nutrients, either of which will affect the health and vigor of the plants. Many soils in
Douglas County have pH of more than 7.4 within a depth of 40 inches. Harpster,
Hartsburg, Senachwine, and Octagon soils are subject to this limitation.
Limited available water capacity occurs when the available water capacity in the
upper 60 inches is less than 6.0. This limitation defines the potential droughtiness of a
soil. Mona soils are subject to this limitation.
Low fertility occurs when the average content of organic matter in the surface layer
is less than 1 percent or the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is less than or equal to 7
milliequivalents per 100 grams. Low organic matter content and low cation-exchange
capacity result in a limited capacity of the soil to retain nutrients for plant use. Severely
eroded Mona soils are examples of soils that have low fertility.
Frequent applications of small amounts of fertilizer help to prevent excessive loss of
plant nutrients through leaching. Legumes, when used as part of a seeding mixture,
can provide nitrogen to grass varieties. Timely deferment of grazing helps to maintain
a protective cover on the surface and maintains the content of organic matter, which is
a source of nutrients in the soil.
