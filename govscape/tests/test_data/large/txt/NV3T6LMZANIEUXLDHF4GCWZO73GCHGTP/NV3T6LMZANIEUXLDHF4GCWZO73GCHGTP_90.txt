Mona Series
Taxonomic classification: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls
Taxadjunct features: The Mona soils in this survey area have a lighter colored surface
layer than is defined as the range for the series. This difference, however, does not
significantly affect the use and management of the soils. These soils are classified
as fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs.
