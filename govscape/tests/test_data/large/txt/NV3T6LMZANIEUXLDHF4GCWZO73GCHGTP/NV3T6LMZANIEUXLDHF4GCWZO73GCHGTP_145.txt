134 Soil Survey of
gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact
on the use and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation. The limitations
appear in order from the most limiting to the least limiting. Thus, if more than one
limitation is identified, the most severe limitation is listed first and the least severe one
is listed last.
Crops and Pasture
General management needed for crops and pasture is suggested in this section.
The estimated yields of the main crops and pasture plants are listed, the system of
land capability classification used by the Natural Resources Conservation Service is
explained, and prime farmland is described.
Planners of management systems for individual fields or farms should consider the
detailed information given in the description of each soil under the heading “Soil Series
and Detailed Soil Map Units.” Specific information can be obtained from the local office
of the Natural Resources Conservation Service or the Cooperative Extension Service.
In 2002, approximately 223,202 acres in Douglas County was used as cropland and
3,001 acres was used as pastureland. The major row crops were corn and soybeans.
Wheat and oats were the major small grain crops grown. Corn for grain was grown on
about 108,357 acres and had an average yield of 131 bushels per acre. Soybeans
were grown on about 104,025 acres and had an average yield of 46 bushels per acre.
Wheat was grown on 487 acres and had an average yield of 71 bushels per acre. Oats
were grown on 914 acres and had an average yield of 65 bushels per acre. Hay was
grown on about 3,424 acres and had an average yield of 2.6 tons per acre. Corn for
silage was grown on 736 acres and had an average yield of 15.9 tons per acre.
Vegetables were grown on about 131 acres. About 97 percent of the planted acreage
was harvested (Illinois Agricultural Statistics Service, 2002).
The soils in Douglas County have good potential for continued crop production,
especially if the latest crop production technologies are applied. This soil survey can
be used as a guide for applying these technologies.
Limitations and Hazards Affecting Cropland
The management concerns affecting the use of the detailed soil map units in the
survey area for crops are shown in table 6. The main concerns include crusting,
excess lime, flooding, high pH, limited available water capacity, low pH, ponding, poor
tilth, restricted permeability, water erosion, and wetness.
Crusting occurs when the average content of organic matter in the surface layer is
less than or equal to 2.5 percent and the content of clay is greater than 20 percent and
less than or equal to 35 percent. Flowing water or raindrops break down soil structural
units, moving clay downward and leaving a concentration of sand and silt particles on
the surface layer. Crusts can reduce the rate of water infiltration, increase the runoff
rate, inhibit seedling emergence and proper growth, and reduce oxygen diffusion to
seedlings. Generally, if the structure in the surface layer is weak, a crust forms during
periods of intense rainfall. Camden, Senachwine, Sabina, and Xenia soils are
examples of soils that have a low content of organic matter in the surface layer and are
susceptible to crusting.
Practices that minimize surface crusting protect the surface from the impact of
raindrops and flowing water. Incorporating green manure crops, manure, or crop
residue into the soil and using a system of conservation tillage help to prevent crusting
by improving tilth.
Excess lime is a management concern in areas of Harpster soils. These soils have
a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 percent or more in the surface layer, or they
meet the requirements for a calcic horizon at or near the surface. This limitation can be
