results in the formation of small ridges perpendicular to the slope of the land. The
ridges greatly reduce the velocity of the water moving downhill.
Stripcropping, although not used widely in the survey area, is an effective erosion-
control measure if used in combination with other methods. It involves alternating rows
or strips of one crop with rows of another crop that has a different rate of maturity and
a different canopy cover. The rows are planted on the contour. The resulting vegetation
reduces the hazard of erosion by protecting the surface from the impact of raindrops.
Erosion-control management through tillage and cropping systems is effective alone
or in combination on most of the farmland in the county. The combination used and its
effectiveness depend on soil characteristics and topography. Information about the
design of erosion-control practices for each kind of soil is provided in the Field Office
Technical Guide, which is available in local offices of the Natural Resources
Conservation Service.
Conservation Tillage
Most of the cropland in Douglas County can be protected from erosion by using a
system of conservation tillage. Conservation tillage includes any non-inversion tillage
practice that keeps a protective cover of residue on the surface throughout the year.
The crop residue increases the rate of water infiltration by improving tilth. It also
protects the surface from the beating action of raindrops, prevents surface crusting,
and provides a more friable seedbed for good germination (fig. 15).
Chisel tillage is a common system of conservation tillage used in Douglas County. It
leaves crop residue covering 20 to 60 percent of the surface. The extent of the
coverage depends on the type of chisel plow used, the speed with which the
