and/or terraces in combination with a conservation tillage system can help to control
erosion. Sedimentation problems should be addressed for maintenance of proper
drainage. Removal of sediments is expensive. Management measures that help to
control water erosion also help to minimize sedimentation and can improve the quality
of water available for rural, municipal, and recreational uses and for fish and wildlife.
Wetness is a limitation when the seasonal high water table is within a depth of 1.5
feet. Wetness is a management concern on about 82 percent of the acreage used for
crops and pasture in Douglas County. Some soils are naturally so wet that the
production of crops is not possible unless a drainage system is installed. The poorly
drained Drummer, Hartsburg, Milford, and Sawmill soils are examples of soils that are
subject to wetness. Seasonal wetness in areas of somewhat poorly drained soils, such
as Flanagan, Shaffton, Raub, Sabina, Starks, Sunbury, and Rutland soils, can delay
planting in wet years.
Most naturally wet soils are already drained by tile, but many drainage systems are
old and should be replaced if maximum efficiency is to be achieved. Subsurface drains
can lower the seasonal high water table if suitable outlets are available. In soils that
have a high content of clay and restricted permeability, subsurface drainage may not
be practical. In these soils, surface ditches can reduce the wetness. Milford soils
commonly have both tile drainage and surface ditches, especially in the central part of
Douglas County. Management of drainage in conformance with regulations influencing
wetlands may require special permits and extra planning.
Wind erosion occurs on soils that are in wind erodibility groups 1 and 2. These soils
typically have a surface layer of sand or loamy sand and are more susceptible to soil
blowing than other soils. Wind erosion can also occur on fine textured soils. Generally,
most soils that have the surface exposed as a result of cultivation are subject to wind
erosion. Surface texture, moisture content, the content of organic matter, the content
of calcium carbonate, the content of rock fragments, aggregate stability, and cultivation
practices can affect the susceptibility to wind erosion. Large areas without field
windbreaks and cleared areas on flood plains are vulnerable. Most of the soils in
Douglas County are not susceptible to wind erosion. Clayey soils, however, such as
Milford and Peotone soils, are moderately susceptible to soil blowing.
Conservation tillage, crop residue management, moisture management,
conservation structures, and windbreaks can be used to limit the damage caused by
wind erosion.
Limitations and Hazards Affecting Pastureland
Planting legumes, cool-season grasses, and warm-season grasses suited to the
soils and climate of the area helps to maintain a productive stand of pasture.
Suitable pasture and hay plants include several legumes, cool-season grasses, and
native warm-season grasses. Alfalfa, red clover, alsike clover, and ladino clover are
legumes commonly grown in the county. Alfalfa is best suited to well drained soils,
such as Camden and Martinsville soils, and moderately well drained soils, such as
Dana and Xenia soils. Alfalfa is suited to some of the somewhat poorly drained soils,
such as Flanagan, Raub, and Sunbury soils. Other legumes, such as alsike clover, red
clover, and ladino clover, are more tolerant of wetter conditions. These legumes are
better suited to poorly drained soils, such as Drummer, Sawmill, and Hartsburg soils,
and somewhat poorly drained soils, such as Fincastle and Sabina soils.
Cool-season grasses commonly grown in the county include smooth bromegrass,
orchardgrass, timothy, and tall fescue. These grasses can be seeded alone or in
mixtures with legumes. Native warm-season grasses, such as indiangrass, big
bluestem, and switchgrass, grow very well in the summer. They require different
management techniques from those used for cool-season grasses.
