Use and Management of the Soils
This soil survey is an inventory and evaluation of the soils in the survey area. It can
be used to adjust land uses to the limitations and potentials of natural resources and
the environment. Also, it can help to prevent soil-related failures in land uses.
In preparing a soil survey, soil scientists, conservationists, engineers, and others
collect extensive field data about the nature and behavioral characteristics of the soils.
They collect data on erosion, droughtiness, flooding, and other factors that affect
various soil uses and management. Field experience and collected data on soil
properties and performance are used as a basis in predicting soil behavior.
Information in this section can be used to plan the use and management of soils for
crops and pasture; as forestland; as sites for buildings, sanitary facilities, highways and
other transportation systems, and parks and other recreational facilities; and as wildlife
habitat. It can be used to identify the potentials and limitations of each soil for specific
land uses and to help prevent construction failures caused by unfavorable soil
properties.
Planners and others using soil survey information can evaluate the effect of specific
land uses on productivity and on the environment in all or part of the survey area. The
survey can help planners to maintain or create a land use pattern in harmony with the
natural soil.
Contractors can use this survey to locate sources of gravel, sand, reclamation
material, roadfill, and topsoil. They can use it to identify areas where bedrock,
wetness, or very firm soil layers can cause difficulty in excavation.
Health officials, highway officials, engineers, and others may also find this survey
useful. The survey can help them plan the safe disposal of wastes and locate sites for
pavements, sidewalks, campgrounds, playgrounds, lawns, and trees and shrubs.
Interpretive Ratings
The interpretive tables in this survey rate the soils in the survey area for various
uses. Many of the tables identify the limitations that affect specified uses and indicate
the severity of those limitations. The ratings in these tables are both verbal and
numerical.
Rating Class Terms
Rating classes are expressed in the tables in terms that indicate the extent to which
the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect a specified use or in terms that
indicate the suitability of the soils for the use. Thus, the tables may show limitation
classes or suitability classes. Terms for the limitation classes are not limited,
somewhat limited, and very limited. The suitability ratings are expressed as well suited,
moderately suited, poorly suited, and unsuited or as good, fair, and poor.
Numerical Ratings
Numerical ratings in the tables indicate the relative severity of individual limitations.
The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.00 to 1.00. They indicate
