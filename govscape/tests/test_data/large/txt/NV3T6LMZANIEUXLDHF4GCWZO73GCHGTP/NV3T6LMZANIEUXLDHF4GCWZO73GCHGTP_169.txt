bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect absorption of the effluent. Stones and
boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation. Subsidence
interferes with installation and maintenance. Excessive slope may cause lateral
seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas.
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth
of less than 4 feet below the distribution lines. In these soils the absorption field may
not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new. As a result, the
ground water may become contaminated.
Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic
bacteria decompose the solid and liquid wastes. Lagoons should have a nearly level
floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted soil. Nearly impervious
soil material for the lagoon floor and sides is required to minimize seepage and
contamination of ground water. Considered in the ratings are slope, permeability, depth
to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, large stones,
and content of organic matter.
Soil permeability is a critical property affecting the suitability for sewage lagoons.
Most porous soils eventually become sealed when they are used as sites for sewage
lagoons. Until sealing occurs, however, the hazard of pollution is severe. Soils that
have a permeability rate of more than 2 inches per hour are too porous for the proper
functioning of sewage lagoons. In these soils, seepage of the effluent can result in
contamination of the ground water. Ground-water contamination is also a hazard if
fractured bedrock is within a depth of 40 inches, if the water table is high enough to
raise the level of sewage in the lagoon, or if floodwater overtops the lagoon.
A high content of organic matter is detrimental to proper functioning of the lagoon
because it inhibits aerobic activity. Slope, bedrock, and cemented pans can cause
construction problems, and large stones can hinder compaction of the lagoon floor. If
the lagoon is to be uniformly deep throughout, the slope must be gentle enough and
the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make land
smoothing practical.
A trench sanitary landfill is an area where solid waste is placed in successive layers
in an excavated trench. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin
layer of soil excavated at the site. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material
at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill. The ratings in the table are based on the
soil properties that affect the risk of pollution, the ease of excavation, trafficability, and
revegetation. These properties include permeability, depth to bedrock or a cemented
pan, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, flooding, texture, stones and boulders,
highly organic layers, soil reaction, and content of salts and sodium. Unless otherwise
stated, the ratings apply only to that part of the soil within a depth of about 6 feet. For
deeper trenches, onsite investigation may be needed.
Hard, nonrippable bedrock, creviced bedrock, or highly permeable strata in or
directly below the proposed trench bottom can affect the ease of excavation and the
hazard of ground-water pollution. Slope affects construction of the trenches and the
movement of surface water around the landfill. It also affects the construction and
performance of roads in areas of the landfill.
Soil texture and consistence affect the ease with which the trench is dug and the
ease with which the soil can be used as daily or final cover. They determine the
workability of the soil when dry and when wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when
wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and are difficult to place as a uniformly
thick cover over a layer of refuse.
The soil material used as the final cover for a trench landfill should be suitable for
plants. It should not have excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. The
surface layer generally has the best workability, the highest content of organic matter,
and the best potential for plants. Material from the surface layer should be stockpiled
for use as the final cover.
