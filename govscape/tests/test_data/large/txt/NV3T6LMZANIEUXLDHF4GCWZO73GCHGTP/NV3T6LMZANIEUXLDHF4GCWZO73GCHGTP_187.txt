176 Soil Survey of
Backslope. The position that forms the steepest and generally linear, middle portion of
a hillslope. In profile, backslopes are commonly bounded by a convex shoulder
above and a concave footslope below.
Basal area. The area of a cross section of a tree, generally referring to the section at
breast height and measured outside the bark. It is a measure of stand density,
commonly expressed in square feet.
Basal till. Compact till deposited beneath the ice.
Base saturation. The degree to which material having cation-exchange properties is
saturated with exchangeable bases (sum of Ca, Mg, Na, and K), expressed as a
percentage of the total cation-exchange capacity.
Base slope (geomorphology). A geomorphic component of hills consisting of the
concave to linear (perpendicular to the contour) slope that, regardless of the
lateral shape, forms an apron or wedge at the bottom of a hillside dominated by
colluvium and slope-wash sediments (for example, slope alluvium).
Batavia facies (geology). An informal separation of the Henry Formation. Consists of
stratified silt loam to gravelly sandy loam with thin bands of finer or coarser
material on outwash plains.
Batestown Member (geology). The medium textured, lowermost unit of diamicton in
the Lemont Formation. Diamicton of the Batestown Member generally consists of
calcareous, dark gray to gray silt loam to loam that contains lenses of gravel,
sand, silt, and clay. Locally, the Batestown Member is finer texturally and therefore
similar to the Yorkville Member.
Bedding plane. A planar or nearly planar bedding surface that visibly separates each
successive layer of stratified sediment or rock (of the same or different lithology)
from the preceding or following layer; a plane of deposition. It commonly marks a
change in the circumstances of deposition and may show a parting, a color
difference, a change in particle size, or various combinations of these. The term is
commonly applied to any bedding surface, even one that is conspicuously bent or
deformed by folding.
Bedding system. A drainage system made by plowing, grading, or otherwise shaping
the surface of a flat field. It consists of a series of low ridges separated by shallow,
parallel dead furrows.
Bedrock. The solid rock that underlies the soil and other unconsolidated material or
that is exposed at the surface.
Bedrock-controlled topography. A landscape where the configuration and relief of
the landforms are determined or strongly influenced by the underlying bedrock.
Bench terrace. A raised, level or nearly level strip of earth constructed on or nearly on
a contour, supported by a barrier of rocks or similar material, and designed to
make the soil suitable for tillage and to prevent accelerated erosion.
Bisequum. Two sequences of soil horizons, each of which consists of an illuvial
horizon and the overlying eluvial horizons.
Blowout. A saucer-, cup-, or trough-shaped depression formed by wind erosion on a
preexisting dune or other sand deposit, especially in an area of shifting sand or
loose soil or where protective vegetation is disturbed or destroyed; the adjoining
accumulation of sand derived from the depression, where recognizable, is
commonly included. Blowouts are commonly small.
Bottom land. An informal term loosely applied to various portions of a flood plain.
Boulders. Rock fragments larger than 2 feet (60 centimeters) in diameter.
Breaks. A landscape or tract of steep, rough or broken land dissected by ravines and
gullies and marking a sudden change in topography.
Breast height. An average height of 4.5 feet above the ground surface; the point on a
tree where diameter measurements are ordinarily taken.
Brush management. Use of mechanical, chemical, or biological methods to make
conditions favorable for reseeding or to reduce or eliminate competition from
