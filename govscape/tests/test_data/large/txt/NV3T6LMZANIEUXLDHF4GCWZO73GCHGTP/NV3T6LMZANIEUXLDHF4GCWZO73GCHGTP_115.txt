Similar soils:
(cid:127) Soils that have a dark surface layer less than 24 inches thick
(cid:127) Soils that have a dark surface layer and subsoil more than 36 inches thick
(cid:127) Soils that have a loamy subsoil
(cid:127) Soils that are subject to occasional flooding
(cid:127) Soils in the slightly higher areas that are subject to shorter periods of flooding or
ponding
Dissimilar soils:
