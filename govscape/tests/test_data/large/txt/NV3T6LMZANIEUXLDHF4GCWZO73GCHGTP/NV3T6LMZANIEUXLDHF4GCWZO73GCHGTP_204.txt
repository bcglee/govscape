Solum. The upper part of a soil profile, above the C horizon, in which the processes of
soil formation are active. The solum in soil consists of the A, E, and B horizons.
Generally, the characteristics of the material in these horizons are unlike those of
the material below the solum. The living roots and plant and animal activities are
largely confined to the solum.
Stone line. In a vertical cross section, a line formed by scattered fragments or a
discrete layer of angular and subangular rock fragments (commonly a gravel- or
cobble-sized lag concentration) that formerly was draped across a topographic
surface and was later buried by additional sediments. A stone line generally caps
material that was subject to weathering, soil formation, and erosion before burial.
Many stone lines seem to be buried erosion pavements, originally formed by sheet
and rill erosion across the land surface.
Stones. Rock fragments 10 to 24 inches (25 to 60 centimeters) in diameter if rounded
or 15 to 24 inches (38 to 60 centimeters) in length if flat.
Stony. Refers to a soil containing stones in numbers that interfere with or prevent
tillage.
Strath terrace. A type of stream terrace; formed as an erosional surface cut on
bedrock and thinly mantled with stream deposits (alluvium).
Stream terrace. One of a series of platforms in a stream valley, flanking and more or
less parallel to the stream channel, originally formed near the level of the stream;
represents the remnants of an abandoned flood plain, stream bed, or valley floor
produced during a former state of fluvial erosion or deposition.
Stripcropping. Growing crops in a systematic arrangement of strips or bands that
provide vegetative barriers to wind erosion and water erosion.
Structure, soil. The arrangement of primary soil particles into compound particles or
aggregates. The principal forms of soil structure are—platy (laminated), prismatic
(vertical axis of aggregates longer than horizontal), columnar (prisms with rounded
tops), blocky (angular or subangular), and granular. Structureless soils are either
single grained (each grain by itself, as in dune sand) or massive (the particles
adhering without any regular cleavage, as in many hardpans).
Stubble mulch. Stubble or other crop residue left on the soil or partly worked into the
soil. It protects the soil from wind erosion and water erosion after harvest, during
preparation of a seedbed for the next crop, and during the early growing period of
the new crop.
Subsoil. Technically, the B horizon; roughly, the part of the solum below plow depth.
Subsoiling. Tilling a soil below normal plow depth, ordinarily to shatter a hardpan or
claypan.
Substratum. The part of the soil below the solum.
Subsurface layer. Any surface soil horizon (A, E, AB, or EB) below the surface layer.
Summer fallow. The tillage of uncropped land during the summer to control weeds
and allow storage of moisture in the soil for the growth of a later crop. A practice
common in semiarid regions, where annual precipitation is not enough to produce
a crop every year. Summer fallow is frequently practiced before planting winter
grain.
Summit. The topographically highest position of a hillslope. It has a nearly level
(planar or only slightly convex) surface.
Surface layer. The soil ordinarily moved in tillage, or its equivalent in uncultivated soil,
ranging in depth from 4 to 10 inches (10 to 25 centimeters). Frequently designated
as the “plow layer,” or the “Ap horizon.”
Surface soil. The A, E, AB, and EB horizons, considered collectively. It includes all
subdivisions of these horizons.
Taxadjuncts. Soils that cannot be classified in a series recognized in the classification
system. Such soils are named for a series they strongly resemble and are
