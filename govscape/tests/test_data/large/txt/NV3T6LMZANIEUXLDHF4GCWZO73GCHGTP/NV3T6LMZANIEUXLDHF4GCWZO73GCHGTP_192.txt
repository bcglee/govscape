Fertility, soil. The quality that enables a soil to provide plant nutrients, in adequate
amounts and in proper balance, for the growth of specified plants when light,
moisture, temperature, tilth, and other growth factors are favorable.
Fibric soil material (peat). The least decomposed of all organic soil material. Peat
contains a large amount of well preserved fiber that is readily identifiable
according to botanical origin. Peat has the lowest bulk density and the highest
water content at saturation of all organic soil material.
Field moisture capacity. The moisture content of a soil, expressed as a percentage
of the ovendry weight, after the gravitational, or free, water has drained away; the
field moisture content 2 or 3 days after a soaking rain; also called normal field
capacity, normal moisture capacity, or capillary capacity.
Fill slope. A sloping surface consisting of excavated soil material from a road cut. It
commonly is on the downhill side of the road.
Fine textured soil. Sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.
Firebreak. An area cleared of flammable material to stop or help control creeping or
running fires. It also serves as a line from which to work and to facilitate the
movement of firefighters and equipment. Designated roads also serve as
firebreaks.
First bottom. An obsolete, informal term loosely applied to the lowest flood-plain
steps that are subject to regular flooding.
Flaggy soil material. Material that has, by volume, 15 to 35 percent flagstones. Very
flaggy soil material has 35 to 60 percent flagstones, and extremely flaggy soil
material has more than 60 percent flagstones.
Flagstone. A thin fragment of sandstone, limestone, slate, shale, or (rarely) schist 6 to
15 inches (15 to 38 centimeters) long.
Flood plain. The nearly level plain that borders a stream and is subject to flooding
unless protected artificially.
Flood-plain landforms. A variety of constructional and erosional features produced
by stream channel migration and flooding. Examples include backswamps, flood-
plain splays, meanders, meander belts, meander scrolls, oxbow lakes, and natural
levees.
Flood-plain splay. A fan-shaped deposit or other outspread deposit formed where an
overloaded stream breaks through a levee (natural or artificial) and deposits its
material (commonly coarse grained) on the flood plain.
Flood-plain step. An essentially flat, terrace-like alluvial surface within a valley that is
frequently covered by floodwater from the present stream; any approximately
horizontal surface still actively modified by fluvial scour and/or deposition. May
occur individually or as a series of steps.
Fluvial. Of or pertaining to rivers or streams; produced by stream or river action.
Footslope. The concave surface at the base of a hillslope. A footslope is a transition
zone between upslope sites of erosion and transport (shoulders and backslopes)
and downslope sites of deposition (toeslopes).
Forb. Any herbaceous plant not a grass or a sedge.
Forest cover. All trees and other woody plants (underbrush) covering the ground in a
forest.
Forest type. A stand of trees similar in composition and development because of
given physical and biological factors by which it may be differentiated from other
stands.
Fragipan. A loamy, brittle subsurface horizon low in porosity and content of organic
matter and low or moderate in clay but high in silt or very fine sand. A fragipan
appears cemented and restricts roots. When dry, it is hard or very hard and has a
higher bulk density than the horizon or horizons above. When moist, it tends to
rupture suddenly under pressure rather than to deform slowly.
