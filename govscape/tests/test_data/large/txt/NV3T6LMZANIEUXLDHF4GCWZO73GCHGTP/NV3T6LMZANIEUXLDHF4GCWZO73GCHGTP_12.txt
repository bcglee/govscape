history and development; physiography, relief, and drainage; natural resources; and
climate.
History and Development
Native Americans known as Mound Builders were among the first people known to
inhabit the survey area (Kehoe, 1981). The Kickapoo Indians inhabited the area just
prior to the arrival of the first European settlers (Golden and Golden, 1990). Other
tribes included the Pottawatomie and Winnebago. By the time most European settlers
arrived, many of the tribes had moved westward across the Mississippi River.
The early settlers used the rivers and creeks for fishing and for travel lanes. They
also favored the timbered areas because of the availability of firewood, the abundance
of game, the danger of prairie fires, and the belief that the prairies were in general
infertile and unproductive. The prairie served mainly as open grazing land for livestock.
