Fincastle Series
Taxonomic classification: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs
Taxadjunct features: The Fincastle soils in this survey area are slightly deeper to a
high water table than is defined as the range for the series. This difference,
however, does not significantly affect the use and management of the soils. These
soils are classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs.
