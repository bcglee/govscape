(cid:127) Soils that have a thin dark surface layer
(cid:127) Soils that have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches
(cid:127) Soils that have a thicker dark surface soil and more clay in the subsoil
(cid:127) Soils that have a loamy surface layer or subsoil
(cid:127) Soils that are subject to very rare flooding
Dissimilar soils:
(cid:127) Soils that have a thin, light-colored surface layer
(cid:127) The somewhat poorly drained Brenton soils in the slightly higher landscape positions
(cid:127) Soils on low terraces or flood plains that are subject to more than very rare flooding
