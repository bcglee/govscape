than soils having a high cation-exchange capacity. The ability to retain cations reduces
the hazard of ground-water pollution.
Effective cation-exchange capacity refers to the sum of extractable bases plus
aluminum expressed in terms of milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil. It is determined
for soils that have pH of less than 5.5.
Soil reaction is a measure of acidity or alkalinity. The pH of each soil horizon is
based on many field tests. For many soils, values have been verified by laboratory
analyses. Soil reaction is important in selecting crops and other plants, in evaluating
soil amendments for fertility and stabilization, and in determining the risk of corrosion.
Calcium carbonate equivalent is the percent of carbonates, by weight, in the fraction
of the soil less than 2 millimeters in size. The availability of plant nutrients is influenced
by the amount of carbonates in the soil. Incorporating nitrogen fertilizer into calcareous
soils helps to prevent nitrite accumulation and ammonium-N volatilization.
Organic matter is the plant and animal residue in the soil at various stages of
decomposition. In table 20, the estimated content of organic matter is expressed as a
percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 millimeters in diameter.
The content of organic matter in a soil can be maintained by returning crop residue
to the soil. Organic matter has a positive effect on available water capacity, water
infiltration, soil organism activity, and tilth. It is a source of nitrogen and other nutrients
for crops and soil organisms.
Water Features
Table 21 gives estimates of various water features. The estimates are used in land
use planning that involves engineering considerations.
Hydrologic soil groups are based on estimates of runoff potential. Soils are
assigned to one of four groups according to the rate of water infiltration when the soils
are not protected by vegetation, are thoroughly wet, and receive precipitation from
long-duration storms.
The four hydrologic soil groups are:
Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly
wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or
gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.
Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These
consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained
soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have
a moderate rate of water transmission.
Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist
chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils
of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water
transmission.
Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when
thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential,
soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the
surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. These soils have a
very slow rate of water transmission.
If a soil is assigned to a dual hydrologic group (A/D, B/D, or C/D), the first letter is
for drained areas and the second is for undrained areas.
Ponding is standing water in a closed depression. Unless a drainage system is
installed, the water is removed only by percolation, transpiration, or evaporation. Table
21 indicates surface water depth and the duration and frequency of ponding. Duration
is expressed as very brief if less than 2 days, brief if 2 to 7 days, long if 7 to 30 days,
and very long if more than 30 days. Frequency is expressed as none, rare, occasional,
and frequent. None means that ponding is not probable; rare that it is unlikely but
