Prime farmland category: Not prime farmland
Hydric soil status: Milford, undrained—hydric; Milford, drained—hydric
Millbrook Series
Taxonomic classification: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Udollic Endoaqualfs
Taxadjunct features: The Millbrook soils in this survey area are better drained than is
defined as the range for the series. This difference, however, does not significantly
affect the use and management of the soils. These soils are classified as fine-silty,
mixed, superactive, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs.
