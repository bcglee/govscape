Wildlife Habitat
Much of Douglas County was once part of a broad, tall-grass prairie that contained
wet meadows, marshes, and areas of open water. This broad area is near the
southern limit of the midwestern prairie pothole region that provided valuable nesting
and stop-over habitat for migratory waterfowl and habitat for other wetland and
openland wildlife. Although some areas were woodlands, especially those along
creeks and on moderately steep to very steep landforms, the native plant communities
were dominated by tall prairie grasses.
As the county was settled, the conversion of land for agriculture and urbanization
altered these natural communities and the wildlife species associated with them. The
landscape in the survey area is now a mosaic of urban development, cropland,
pasture, isolated areas of forestland, wetlands, and waterways that support wildlife
species that are able to adapt to the human-altered landscape. These species include
whitetail deer, fox, coyotes, mourning doves, pheasants, squirrels, cardinals, and
raccoons.
The largest areas managed for wildlife in the county are in the Walnut Point State
Park and other nature preserves. Walnut Point covers about 631 acres and includes a
59-acre lake and a 65-acre nature preserve (fig. 17). It is managed by the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources.
Wildlife habitat is commonly a secondary use in most areas. Large areas of nearly
level and gently sloping soils used for cultivated crops and pasture are generally well
suited to use as habitat for openland wildlife. Most areas in the county can be
improved for wildlife habitat by providing needed food, cover, and water.
Soils affect the kind and amount of vegetation that is available to wildlife as food and
cover. They also affect the construction of water impoundments. The kind and
abundance of wildlife depend largely on the amount and distribution of food, cover, and
water. Wildlife habitat can be created or improved by planting appropriate vegetation,
by maintaining the existing plant cover, or by promoting the natural establishment of
desirable plants.
In table 13, the soils in the survey area are rated according to their potential for
providing habitat for various kinds of wildlife. This information can be used in planning
parks, wildlife refuges, nature study areas, and other developments for wildlife; in
selecting soils that are suitable for establishing, improving, or maintaining specific
elements of wildlife habitat; and in determining the intensity of management needed for
each element of the habitat.
The potential of the soil is rated good, fair, poor, or very poor. A rating of good
indicates that the element or kind of habitat is easily established, improved, or
maintained. Few or no limitations affect management, and satisfactory results can be
expected. A rating of fair indicates that the element or kind of habitat can be
established, improved, or maintained in most places. Moderately intensive
management is required for satisfactory results. A rating of poor indicates that
limitations are severe for the designated element or kind of habitat. Habitat can be
created, improved, or maintained in most places, but management is difficult and must
be intensive. A rating of very poor indicates that restrictions for the element or kind of
habitat are very severe and that unsatisfactory results can be expected. Creating,
improving, or maintaining habitat is impractical or impossible.
The elements of wildlife habitat are described in the following paragraphs.
Grain and seed crops are domestic grains and seed-producing herbaceous plants.
Soil properties and features that affect the growth of grain and seed crops are depth of
the root zone, texture of the surface layer, available water capacity, wetness, slope,
