186 Soil Survey of
Loess. Material transported and deposited by wind and consisting dominantly of silt-
sized particles.
Low strength. The soil is not strong enough to support loads.
Low-residue crops. Such crops as corn used for silage, peas, beans, and potatoes.
Residue from these crops is not adequate to control erosion until the next crop in
the rotation is established. These crops return little organic matter to the soil.
Mackinaw facies (geology). The Mackinaw facies is an informal separation of the
Henry Formation. It consists of well sorted sand and gravel outwash deposits in
valleys leading outward from glacier fronts. Preserved today as terraces beneath
Holocene deposits in major stream and river valleys.
Mason Group (geology). The Mason Group comprises three proglacial and one
postglacial sorted sediment formations that represent distinct stratigraphic layers
based on grain size and bedding characteristics. The proglacial units are Roxana
Silt, Peoria Silt, and the Henry Formation. The postglacial unit is the Equality
Formation.
Masses. See Redoximorphic features.
Mechanical treatment. Use of mechanical equipment for seeding, brush
management, and other management practices.
Medium textured soil. Very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silt.
Metamorphic rock. Rock of any origin altered in mineralogical composition, chemical
composition, or structure by heat, pressure, and movement at depth in the earth’s
crust. Nearly all such rocks are crystalline.
Mine spoil. An accumulation of displaced earthy material, rock, or other waste
material removed during mining or excavation. Also called earthy fill.
Mineral soil. Soil that is mainly mineral material and low in organic material. Its bulk
density is more than that of organic soil.
Minimum tillage. Only the tillage essential to crop production and prevention of soil
damage.
Miscellaneous area. A kind of map unit that has little or no natural soil and supports
little or no vegetation.
Moderately coarse textured soil. Coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy
loam.
Moderately fine textured soil. Clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam.
Mollic epipedon. A thick, dark, humus-rich surface horizon (or horizons) that has high
base saturation and pedogenic soil structure. It may include the upper part of the
subsoil.
Moraine. In terms of glacial geology, a mound, ridge, or other topographically distinct
accumulation of unsorted, unstratified drift, predominantly till, deposited primarily
by the direct action of glacial ice in a variety of landforms. Also, a general term for
a landform composed mainly of till (except for kame moraines, which are
composed mainly of stratified outwash) that has been deposited by a glacier.
Some types of moraines are disintegration, end, ground, kame, lateral,
recessional, and terminal.
Morphology, soil. The physical makeup of the soil, including the texture, structure,
porosity, consistence, color, and other physical, mineral, and biological properties
of the various horizons, and the thickness and arrangement of those horizons in
the soil profile.
Mottling, soil. Irregular spots of different colors that vary in number and size.
Descriptive terms are as follows: abundance—few, common, and many; size—fine,
medium, and coarse; and contrast—faint, distinct, and prominent. The size
measurements are of the diameter along the greatest dimension. Fine indicates
less than 5 millimeters (about 0.2 inch); medium, from 5 to 15 millimeters (about
0.2 to 0.6 inch); and coarse, more than 15 millimeters (about 0.6 inch).
