General Description
(cid:127) This map unit consists of soils that have been extensively modified by cutting, filling,
and leveling. These soils are near Murdock, Illinois. The area is the site of an inactive
coal mine and has been used to stockpile overburden and mine tailings. Typically,
the surface layer is gravelly loam about 3 inches thick. The underlying material to a
depth of about 60 inches is very channery loam, very channery sandy clay loam, or
very channery clay loam.
Setting
Landform: Mine spoil
