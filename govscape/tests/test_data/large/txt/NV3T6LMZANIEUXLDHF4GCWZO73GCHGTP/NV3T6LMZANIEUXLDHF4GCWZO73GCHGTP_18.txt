Douglas County, Illinois 7
The average relative humidity in midafternoon is about 52 percent in May and June
and about 70 percent in December. Humidity is higher at night, and the average at
dawn is about 84 percent in most months. The sun shines 70 percent of the time
possible in summer and 48 percent in winter. The prevailing wind is from the south in
most months, but it is from the northwest in January, February, and March. Average
windspeed is highest, around 13 miles per hour, in March.
How This Survey Was Made
This survey was made to provide updated information about the soils and
miscellaneous areas in the survey area, which is Major Land Resource Area 108
(fig. 1). Major land resource areas (MLRAs) are geographically associated land
resource units that share a common land use, elevation, topography, climate, water,
soils, and vegetation (USDA, 1981). Map unit design and the detailed soil descriptions
are based on the occurrence of each soil throughout the MLRA.
The information in this survey includes a description of the soils and miscellaneous
areas and their location and a discussion of their properties and the subsequent
effects on suitability, limitations, and management for specified uses.
Soil scientists observed the steepness, length, and shape of the slopes; the general
pattern of drainage; and the kinds of crops and native plants. They dug many holes to
study the soil profile, which is the sequence of natural layers, or horizons, in a soil. The
profile extends from the surface down into the unconsolidated material in which the
soil formed. The unconsolidated material is devoid of roots and other living organisms
and has not been changed by other biological activity.
The soils and miscellaneous areas in the survey area are in an orderly pattern that
is related to the geology, landforms, relief, climate, and natural vegetation of the area.
Each kind of soil and miscellaneous area is associated with a particular kind of
landform or with a segment of the landform. By observing the soils and miscellaneous
areas in the survey area and relating their position to specific segments of the
landform, soil scientists develop a concept, or model, of how the soils were formed.
Thus, during mapping, this model enables the soil scientist to predict with a
considerable degree of accuracy the kind of soil or miscellaneous area at a specific
location on the landform.
Commonly, individual soils on the landscape merge into one another as their
characteristics gradually change. To construct an accurate soil map, however, soil
scientists must determine the boundaries between the soils. They can observe only a
limited number of soil profiles. Nevertheless, these observations, supplemented by an
understanding of the soil-vegetation-landscape relationship, are sufficient to verify
predictions of the kinds of soil in an area and to determine the boundaries.
Soil scientists recorded the characteristics of the soil profiles that they studied. They
noted soil color, texture, size and shape of soil aggregates, kind and amount of rock
fragments, distribution of plant roots, soil reaction, and other features that enable them
to identify soils. After describing the soils in the survey area and determining their
properties, the soil scientists assigned the soils to taxonomic classes (units).
Taxonomic classes are concepts. Each taxonomic class has a set of soil
characteristics with precisely defined limits. The classes are used as a basis for
comparison to classify soils systematically. Soil taxonomy, the system of taxonomic
classification used in the United States, is based mainly on the kind and character of
soil properties and the arrangement of horizons within the profile. After the soil
scientists classified and named the soils in the survey area, they compared the
individual soils with similar soils in the same taxonomic class in other areas so that
they could confirm data and assemble additional data based on experience and
research.
