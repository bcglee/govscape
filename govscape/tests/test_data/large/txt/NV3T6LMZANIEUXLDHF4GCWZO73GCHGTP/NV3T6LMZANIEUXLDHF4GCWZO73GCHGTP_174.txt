Soil Properties
Data relating to soil properties are collected during the course of the soil survey.
Soil properties are ascertained by field examination of the soils and by laboratory
index testing of some benchmark soils. Established standard procedures are followed.
During the survey, many shallow borings are made and examined to identify and
classify the soils and to delineate them on the soil maps. Samples are taken from
some typical profiles and tested in the laboratory to determine particle-size
distribution, plasticity, and compaction characteristics. These results are reported in
table 23.
Estimates of soil properties are based on field examinations, on laboratory tests of
samples from the survey area, and on laboratory tests of samples of similar soils in
nearby areas. Tests verify field observations, verify properties that cannot be estimated
accurately by field observation, and help to characterize key soils.
The estimates of soil properties are shown in tables. They include engineering index
properties, physical and chemical properties, and pertinent soil and water features.
Engineering Index Properties
Table 18 gives the engineering classifications and the range of index properties for
the layers of each soil in the survey area.
Depth to the upper and lower boundaries of each layer is indicated.
Texture is given in the standard terms used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
These terms are defined according to percentages of sand, silt, and clay in the fraction
of the soil that is less than 2 millimeters in diameter (fig. 18). “Loam,” for example, is
soil that is 7 to 27 percent clay, 28 to 50 percent silt, and less than 52 percent sand. If
the content of particles coarser than sand is 15 percent or more, an appropriate
modifier is added, for example, “gravelly.” Textural terms are defined in the Glossary.
Classification of the soils is determined according to the Unified soil classification
system (ASTM, 2005) and the system adopted by the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO, 2004).
The Unified system classifies soils according to properties that affect their use as
construction material. Soils are classified according to particle-size distribution of the
fraction less than 3 inches in diameter and according to plasticity index, liquid limit,
and organic matter content. Sandy and gravelly soils are identified as GW, GP, GM,
GC, SW, SP, SM, and SC; silty and clayey soils as ML, CL, OL, MH, CH, and OH; and
highly organic soils as PT. Soils exhibiting engineering properties of two groups can
have a dual classification, for example, CL-ML.
The AASHTO system classifies soils according to those properties that affect
roadway construction and maintenance. In this system, the fraction of a mineral soil
that is less than 3 inches in diameter is classified in one of seven groups from A-1
through A-7 on the basis of particle-size distribution, liquid limit, and plasticity index.
Soils in group A-1 are coarse grained and low in content of fines (silt and clay). At the
other extreme, soils in group A-7 are fine grained. Highly organic soils are classified in
group A-8 on the basis of visual inspection.
If laboratory data are available, the A-1, A-2, and A-7 groups are further classified
as A-1-a, A-1-b, A-2-4, A-2-5, A-2-6, A-2-7, A-7-5, or A-7-6. As an additional
