consequently they are not mentioned in the descriptions, especially where the pattern
was so complex that it was impractical to make enough observations to identify all the
soils and miscellaneous areas on the landscape.
The presence of minor components in a map unit in no way diminishes the
usefulness or accuracy of the data. The objective of mapping is not to delineate pure
taxonomic classes but rather to separate the landscape into landforms or landform
segments that have similar use and management requirements. The delineation of
such segments on the map provides sufficient information for the development of
resource plans. If intensive use of small areas is planned, however, onsite investigation
is needed to define and locate the soils and miscellaneous areas.
An identifying symbol precedes the map unit name in the map unit descriptions.
Each description includes general facts about the unit and gives the principal hazards
and limitations to be considered in planning for specific uses.
Soils that have profiles that are almost alike make up a soil series. Except for
differences in texture of the surface layer, all the soils of a series have major horizons
that are similar in composition, thickness, and arrangement.
Soils of one series can differ in texture of the surface layer, slope, stoniness,
salinity, degree of erosion, and other characteristics that affect their use. On the basis
of such differences, a soil series is divided into soil phases. Most of the areas shown
on the detailed soil maps are phases of soil series. The name of a soil phase
commonly indicates a feature that affects use or management. For example,
Senachwine silt loam, 10 to 18 percent slopes, eroded, is a phase of the Senachwine
series.
Some map units are made up of two or more major soils or miscellaneous areas.
These map units are called complexes. A complex consists of two or more soils or
miscellaneous areas in such an intricate pattern or in such small areas that they
cannot be shown separately on the maps. The pattern and proportion of the soils or
miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar in all areas. Drummer-Milford silty clay
loams, 0 to 2 percent slopes, is an example.
This survey includes miscellaneous areas. Such areas have little or no soil material
and support little or no vegetation. Pits, gravel, is an example.
Table 5 gives the acreage and proportionate extent of each map unit. Other tables
give properties of the soils and the limitations, capabilities, and potentials for many
uses. The Glossary defines many of the terms used in describing the soils or
miscellaneous areas.
