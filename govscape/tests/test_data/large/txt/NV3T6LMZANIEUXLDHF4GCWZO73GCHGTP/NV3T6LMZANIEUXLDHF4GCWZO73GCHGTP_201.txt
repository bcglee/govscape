manganese are oxidized and precipitated, they form either soft masses or hard
concretions or nodules. Movement of iron and manganese as a result of
redoximorphic processes in a soil may result in redoximorphic features that are
defined as follows:
1. Redoximorphic concentrations.—These are zones of apparent accumulation of
iron-manganese oxides, including:
A. Nodules and concretions, which are cemented bodies that can be removed
from the soil intact. Concretions are distinguished from nodules on the
basis of internal organization. A concretion typically has concentric layers
that are visible to the naked eye. Nodules do not have visible organized
internal structure; and
B. Masses, which are noncemented concentrations of substances within the
soil matrix; and
C. Pore linings, i.e., zones of accumulation along pores that may be either
coatings on pore surfaces or impregnations from the matrix adjacent to the
pores.
2. Redoximorphic depletions.—These are zones of low chroma (chromas less
than those in the matrix) where either iron-manganese oxides alone or both
iron-manganese oxides and clay have been stripped out, including:
A. Iron depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of iron and
manganese oxides but have a clay content similar to that of the adjacent
matrix; and
B. Clay depletions, i.e., zones that contain low amounts of iron, manganese,
and clay (often referred to as silt coatings or skeletans).
3. Reduced matrix.—This is a soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but
undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material
has been exposed to air.
Reduced matrix. See Redoximorphic features.
Regolith. All unconsolidated earth materials above the solid bedrock. It includes
material weathered in place from all kinds of bedrock and alluvial, glacial, eolian,
lacustrine, and pyroclastic deposits.
Relief. The relative difference in elevation between the upland summits and the
lowlands or valleys of a given region.
Residuum (residual soil material). Unconsolidated, weathered or partly weathered
mineral material that accumulated as bedrock disintegrated in place.
Rill. A very small, steep-sided channel resulting from erosion and cut in
unconsolidated materials by concentrated but intermittent flow of water. A rill
generally is not an obstacle to wheeled vehicles and is shallow enough to be
smoothed over by ordinary tillage.
Riser. The vertical or steep side slope (e.g., escarpment) of terraces, flood-plain
steps, or other stepped landforms; commonly a recurring part of a series of
natural, steplike landforms, such as successive stream terraces.
Road cut. A sloping surface produced by mechanical means during road construction.
It is commonly on the uphill side of the road.
Rock fragments. Rock or mineral fragments having a diameter of 2 millimeters or
more; for example, pebbles, cobbles, stones, and boulders.
Root zone. The part of the soil that can be penetrated by plant roots.
Roxana Silt (geology). Brownish red and gray silt loam. Typically leached of
carbonates. It overlies the Sangamon Geosol and is typically bounded above by
Peoria Silts. It can be distinguished from Peoria Silts by being darker brown and
more clayey. Deposition occurred 75,000 to 27,000 radiocarbon years ago.
Runoff. The precipitation discharged into stream channels from an area. The water
that flows off the surface of the land without sinking into the soil is called surface
