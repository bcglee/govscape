160 Soil Survey of
for low embankments, generally less than 6 feet high and less exacting in design than
higher embankments.
The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet. It is
assumed that soil layers will be mixed when the soil material is excavated and spread.
The ratings are based on the amount of suitable material and on soil properties that
affect the ease of excavation and the performance of the material after it is in place.
The thickness of the suitable material is a major consideration. The ease of excavation
is affected by large stones, depth to a water table, and slope. How well the soil
performs in place after it has been compacted and drained is determined by its
strength (as inferred from the AASHTO classification of the soil) and linear extensibility
(shrink-swell potential).
Topsoil is used to cover an area so that vegetation can be established and
maintained. The upper 40 inches of a soil is evaluated for use as topsoil. Also
evaluated is the reclamation potential of the borrow area. The ratings are based on the
soil properties that affect plant growth; the ease of excavating, loading, and spreading
the material; and reclamation of the borrow area. Toxic substances, soil reaction, and
the properties that are inferred from soil texture, such as available water capacity and
fertility, affect plant growth. The ease of excavating, loading, and spreading is affected
by rock fragments, slope, depth to a water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable
material. Reclamation of the borrow area is affected by slope, depth to a water table,
rock fragments, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and toxic material.
The surface layer of most soils is generally preferred for topsoil because of its
organic matter content. Organic matter greatly increases the absorption and retention
of moisture and nutrients for plant growth.
Gravel and sand are natural aggregates suitable for commercial use with a
minimum of processing. They are used in many kinds of construction. Specifications
for each use vary widely. In table 16b, only the likelihood of finding material in suitable
quantity is evaluated. The suitability of the material for specific purposes is not
evaluated, nor are factors that affect excavation of the material. The properties used to
evaluate the soil as a source of sand or gravel are gradation of grain sizes (as
indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material,
and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains sand or
gravel, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is
that the sand or gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum
thickness.
The soils are rated good, fair, or poor as potential sources of sand and gravel. A
rating of good or fair means that the source material is likely to be in or below the soil.
The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soils are assigned numerical ratings.
These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of sand or gravel. The
number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a poor source. The number 1.00 indicates that
the layer is a good source. A number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicates the degree to
which the layer is a likely source.
Water Management
Tables 17a, 17b, and 17c give information on the soil properties and site features
that affect water management. The degree and kind of soil limitations are given for
pond reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; aquifer-fed excavated ponds;
grassed waterways and surface drains; terraces and diversions; tile drains and
underground outlets; and sprinkler irrigation. The ratings are both verbal and
numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of
the soil features that affect these uses. Not limited indicates that the soil has features
that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low
maintenance can be expected. Somewhat limited indicates that the soil has features
