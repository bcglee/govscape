equipment moves through the field, and the kind of crop planted. Chisel tillage often
follows stalk chopping in the fall, but it can also be used immediately prior to planting
in the spring.
The acreage being farmed by no-till methods is increasing in the county. In no-till
systems, a grain crop is planted directly in a cover crop, sod, or the crop residue of the
previous year. A special planter that disturbs only the row area is used. Herbicides are
used to control competing vegetation. The nearly complete ground cover protects the
soil from the impact of raindrops and helps to control erosion caused by runoff.
Drainage Systems
Drainage systems consist of subsurface tile drains, surface inlets, open drainage
ditches, or a combination of these. They have been installed in most areas of poorly
drained and somewhat poorly drained soils in the county (fig. 16). As a result, these
soils are adequately drained for the crops commonly grown in the area. Some areas of
poorly drained soils require surface tile inlets or shallow surface ditches to remove
ponded water. Some areas of somewhat poorly drained soils are wet long enough that
artificial drainage is required if productivity is to be maintained. Management of
drainage in conformity with wetland regulations may require special permits and extra
planning.
The design of surface and subsurface drainage systems varies with the kind of soil
and the availability of drainage outlets. Some areas of poorly drained soils in
depressions require a combination of surface drains and tile drains. The tile should be
more closely spaced in more slowly permeable soils than in more rapidly permeable
soils. Manipulating drainage can allow the producer to conserve moisture, manage
weeds and insects, and limit the leaching of nutrients and chemicals.
Further information about drainage systems is provided in the Field Office Technical
Guide, which is available in local offices of the Natural Resources Conservation
Service.
Yields per Acre
Table 7 shows the optimum yields per acre that can be expected for the principal
crops (corn, soybeans, winter wheat, and grass-legume hay) under a high level of
management and the yields for grass-legume pasture under an average level of
management. In any given year, yields may be higher or lower than those indicated in
the table because of variations in rainfall and other climatic factors. The land capability
classification of map units in the survey area also is shown in the table.
