86 Soil Survey of
2.5/1) very weakly cemented iron-manganese nodules throughout; neutral; gradual
smooth boundary.
BCg—44 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay loam; weak medium prismatic structure;
firm; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron
accumulation and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) masses of iron and manganese
accumulation in the matrix; krotovinas make up 11 percent of the horizon; violently
effervescent; slightly alkaline.
