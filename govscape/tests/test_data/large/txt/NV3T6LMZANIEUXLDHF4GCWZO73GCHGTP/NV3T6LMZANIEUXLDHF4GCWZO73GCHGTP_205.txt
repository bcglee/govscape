designated as taxadjuncts to that series because they differ in ways too small to
be of consequence in interpreting their use and behavior. Soils are recognized as
taxadjuncts only when one or more of their characteristics are slightly outside the
range defined for the family of the series for which the soils are named.
Terminal moraine. An end moraine that marks the farthest advance of a glacier. It
typically has the form of a massive arcuate or concentric ridge, or complex of
ridges, and is underlain by till and other types of drift.
Terrace (conservation). An embankment, or ridge, constructed across sloping soils on
the contour or at a slight angle to the contour. The terrace intercepts surface runoff
so that water soaks into the soil or flows slowly to a prepared outlet. A terrace in a
field generally is built so that the field can be farmed. A terrace intended mainly for
drainage has a deep channel that is maintained in permanent sod.
Terrace (geomorphology). A steplike surface, bordering a valley floor or shoreline, that
represents the former position of a flood plain, lake, or seashore. The term is
usually applied both to the relatively flat summit surface (tread) that was cut or
built by stream or wave action and to the steeper descending slope (scarp or riser)
that has graded to a lower base level of erosion.
Terracettes. Small, irregular steplike forms on steep hillslopes, especially in pasture,
formed by creep or erosion of surficial materials that may be induced or enhanced
by trampling of livestock, such as sheep or cattle.
Texture, soil. The relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay particles in a mass of soil.
The basic textural classes, in order of increasing proportion of fine particles, are
sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silt, sandy clay loam, clay loam,
silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and clay. The sand, loamy sand, and sandy
loam classes may be further divided by specifying “coarse,” “fine,” or “very fine.”
Thin layer (in tables). Otherwise suitable soil material that is too thin for the specified
use.
Till. Dominantly unsorted and nonstratified drift, generally unconsolidated and
deposited directly by a glacier without subsequent reworking by meltwater, and
consisting of a heterogeneous mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, stones, and
boulders; rock fragments of various lithologies are embedded within a finer matrix
that can range from clay to sandy loam.
Till plain. An extensive area of level to gently undulating soils underlain predominantly
by till and bounded at the distal end by subordinate recessional or end moraines.
Tilth, soil. The physical condition of the soil as related to tillage, seedbed preparation,
seedling emergence, and root penetration.
Tiskilwa Formation (geology). The lowermost sequence of red to gray diamicton
units of the Wedron Group. It has three differentiated members—the Tiskilwa
Member, the Delavan Member, and the Piatt Member. The Tiskilwa Formation
consists of calcareous, red gray to gray, medium textured (clay loam to loam)
diamicton units that contain lenses of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Typically, it
oxidizes to red brown, brown, or yellow brown.
Toeslope. The gently inclined surface at the base of a hillslope. Toeslopes in profile
are commonly gentle and linear and are constructional surfaces forming the lower
part of a hillslope continuum that grades to valley or closed-depression floors.
Topsoil. The upper part of the soil, which is the most favorable material for plant
growth. It is ordinarily rich in organic matter and is used to topdress roadbanks,
lawns, and land affected by mining.
Trace elements. Chemical elements, for example, zinc, cobalt, manganese, copper,
and iron, in soils in extremely small amounts. They are essential to plant growth.
Tread. The flat to gently sloping, topmost, laterally extensive slope of terraces, flood-
plain steps, or other stepped landforms; commonly a recurring part of a series of
natural steplike landforms, such as successive stream terraces.
