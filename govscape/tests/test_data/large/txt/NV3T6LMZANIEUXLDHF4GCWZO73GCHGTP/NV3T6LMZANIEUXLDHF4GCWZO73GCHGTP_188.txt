woody vegetation and thus allow understory grasses and forbs to recover. Brush
management increases forage production and thus reduces the hazard of erosion.
It can improve the habitat for some species of wildlife.
Cahokia Formation (geology). Deposits in flood plains and channels in modern
rivers and streams. Mostly poorly sorted sand, silt, or clay containing local
deposits of sandy gravel.
Calcareous soil. A soil containing enough calcium carbonate (commonly combined
with magnesium carbonate) to effervesce visibly when treated with cold, dilute
hydrochloric acid.
Calcium carbonate. A common mineral in sediments and soils.
Canopy. The leafy crown of trees or shrubs. (See Crown.)
Capillary water. Water held as a film around soil particles and in tiny spaces between
particles. Surface tension is the adhesive force that holds capillary water in the
soil.
Carmi facies (geology). Largely quiet-water lake sediments dominated by well
bedded silt and some clay. See Equality Formation.
Cation. An ion carrying a positive charge of electricity. The common soil cations are
calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and hydrogen.
Cation-exchange capacity. The total amount of exchangeable cations that can be
held by the soil, expressed in terms of milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil at
neutrality (pH 7.0) or at some other stated pH value. The term, as applied to soils,
is synonymous with base-exchange capacity but is more precise in meaning.
Catsteps. See Terracettes.
Channery soil material. Soil material that has, by volume, 15 to 35 percent thin, flat
fragments of sandstone, shale, slate, limestone, or schist as much as 6 inches (15
centimeters) along the longest axis. A single piece is called a channer.
Chemical treatment. Control of unwanted vegetation through the use of chemicals.
Chiseling. Tillage with an implement having one or more soil-penetrating points that
shatter or loosen hard, compacted layers to a depth below normal plow depth.
Clay. As a soil separate, the mineral soil particles less than 0.002 millimeter in
diameter. As a soil textural class, soil material that is 40 percent or more clay, less
than 45 percent sand, and less than 40 percent silt.
Clay depletions. See Redoximorphic features.
Clay film. A thin coating of oriented clay on the surface of a soil aggregate or lining
pores or root channels. Synonyms: clay coating, clay skin.
Claypan. A dense, compact, slowly permeable subsoil layer that contains much more
clay than the overlying materials, from which it is separated by a sharply defined
boundary. A claypan is commonly hard when dry and plastic and sticky when wet.
Climax plant community. The stabilized plant community on a particular site. The
plant cover reproduces itself and does not change so long as the environment
remains the same.
Coarse textured soil. Sand or loamy sand.
Cobble (or cobblestone). A rounded or partly rounded fragment of rock 3 to 10
inches (7.6 to 25 centimeters) in diameter.
Cobbly soil material. Material that has 15 to 35 percent, by volume, rounded or
partially rounded rock fragments 3 to 10 inches (7.6 to 25 centimeters) in
diameter. Very cobbly soil material has 35 to 60 percent of these rock fragments,
and extremely cobbly soil material has more than 60 percent.
COLE (coefficient of linear extensibility). See Linear extensibility.
Colluvium. Unconsolidated, unsorted earth material being transported or deposited
on side slopes and/or at the base of slopes by mass movement (e.g., direct
gravitational action) and by local, unconcentrated runoff.
Complex slope. Irregular or variable slope. Planning or establishing terraces,
diversions, and other water-control structures on a complex slope is difficult.
