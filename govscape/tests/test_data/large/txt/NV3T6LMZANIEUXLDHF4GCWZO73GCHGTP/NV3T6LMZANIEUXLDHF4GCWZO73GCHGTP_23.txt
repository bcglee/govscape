Climate
Douglas County has a temperate, humid continental climate that is uniform
throughout the county. Climatic differences within the county are too small to have
caused significant differences among the soils. In some areas of the county, however,
the effects of climate are modified locally by relief. The influence of climate becomes
more obvious when comparisons are made on a broad regional basis.
Climate affects soil formation through its influence on weathering, plant and animal
life, and erosion. Water from rain and melting snow seeps slowly downward through
the soil and allows physical and chemical reactions to take place in the parent
material. Where water can move downward, it carries clay and dissolved minerals from
the surface soil into the subsoil. In soils having limy parent materials, leaching
commonly removes calcium carbonates to a depth of 40 inches or more. As a result,
these soils are neutral to strongly acid. This acidity promotes other pedogenic
processes, such as the biochemical breakdown of minerals and the translocation of
clays.
Soil temperature affects soil formation. When soil is frozen, for example, many of
the processes of soil formation are slowed or halted. Conversely, warm soil
temperatures encourage the microbial metabolism of soil organic matter, the
downward translocation of clays, and other processes.
Climate also influences the kind and extent of plant and animal life. The climate in
Douglas County has favored tall prairie grasses and deciduous hardwoods. It also has
favored the decomposition of dead plants and animals, which provides humus to the
soil.
Heavy, untimely rains are destructive when they fall on soils that are bare of
vegetation. The raindrops disperse the soil particles, thereby contributing to erosion
and the formation of crusts. Early spring rains in these areas can cause extensive
