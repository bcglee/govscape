Douglas. Larger areas of these materials are identified on geology maps as the
Batavia facies of the Henry Formation or as the Dolton facies of the Henry Formation
(Hansel and Johnson, 1996; Lineback, 1979). Many areas of outwash are included
with alluvium and till on geology maps. Camden, Martinsville, Sexton, and Starks soils
are common on outwash terraces. In some places on the ground moraine, a thin layer
of outwash occurs between the loess and the underlying till. Drummer soils, for
example, occur on ground moraines in Douglas County. They formed in loess and in
the underlying outwash (figs. 6 and 9).
Alluvium is material that was deposited by floodwater along streams. On geology
maps, large areas of alluvial material are identified as the Cahokia Formation (Hansel
and Johnson, 1996). Alluvial soils consist of mostly silty sediments, but in some places
they have more sand or thin layers of loamy and sandy material. Soils that formed in
alluvium are generally stratified in both color and texture. Sawmill and Zook soils
formed in silty alluvium and have a weakly developed subsoil. Medway and Shaffton
soils formed in loamy sediments. The largest areas of alluvial soils are along the
Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers and their tributaries (figs. 7 and 8).
Colluvium is material that is similar to alluvium in composition but is deposited by
gravity at the base of slopes or by slopewash into closed depressions. The material is
silty or clayey and generally dark in prairie areas. Peotone soils formed in colluvium.
Lacustrine sediments are sediments deposited in lakes. Unique to central Illinois,
Douglas County has many soils that formed in the sediments of a large glacial lake
that were deposited when meltwaters flowed into a reservoir bounded by the Arcola,
Pesotum, and West Ridge end moraines. These sediments are mostly silty and clayey.
Large areas of these materials are identified as the Equality Formation (Hansel and
Johnson, 1996). Soils that formed in these sediments include Milford, Rutland, and
Kernan soils (fig. 9). Near the entry into former Lake Douglas, a delta formed from silty
and sandy material. The materials in this area are identified as the Dolton facies of the
