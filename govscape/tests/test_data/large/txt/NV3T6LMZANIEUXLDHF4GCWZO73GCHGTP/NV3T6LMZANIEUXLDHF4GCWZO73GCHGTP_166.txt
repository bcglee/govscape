Habitat for wetland wildlife consists of open, marshy or swampy shallow water
areas. Some of the wildlife attracted to such areas are ducks, geese, herons, shore
birds, muskrat, mink, frogs, snakes, and turtles.
Measures that can improve the habitat for wetland wildlife include delaying or
limiting the cultivation and planting of commodity crops in the shallow depressions that
are subject to ponding; protecting areas of smartweeds, bulrushes, burreeds, and
barnyard grasses; and planting Japanese millet, milo, and short corn varieties to
provide food and cover. Blocking natural channels and manmade drainage systems
can create shallow ponds and marshes. Ducks can be encouraged to nest by digging
pits in areas of poorly drained or very poorly drained soils. The pits should be at least
30 feet in diameter and 2 to 3 feet deep. They provide open water through the spring
and early summer. These areas should be protected from grazing by livestock.
Engineering
This section provides information for planning land uses related to urban
development and to water management. Soils are rated for various uses, and the most
limiting features are identified. Ratings are given for building site development, sanitary
facilities, construction materials, and water management. The ratings are based on
observed performance of the soils and on the data in the tables described under the
heading “Soil Properties.”
Information in this section is intended for land use planning, for evaluating land use
alternatives, and for planning site investigations prior to design and construction. The
information, however, has limitations. For example, estimates and other data generally
apply only to that part of the soil between the surface and a depth of 5 to 7 feet.
Because of the map scale, small areas of different soils may be included within the
mapped areas of a specific soil.
The information is not site specific and does not eliminate the need for onsite
investigation of the soils or for testing and analysis by personnel experienced in the
design and construction of engineering works.
Government ordinances and regulations that restrict certain land uses or impose
specific design criteria were not considered in preparing the information in this section.
Local ordinances and regulations should be considered in planning, in site selection,
and in design.
Soil properties, site features, and observed performance were considered in
determining the ratings in this section. During the fieldwork for this soil survey,
determinations were made about particle-size distribution, liquid limit, plasticity index,
soil reaction, depth to bedrock, hardness of bedrock within 5 to 7 feet of the surface,
soil wetness, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, likelihood of flooding, natural soil
structure aggregation, and soil density. Data were collected about kinds of clay
minerals, mineralogy of the sand and silt fractions, and the kinds of adsorbed cations.
Estimates were made for erodibility, permeability, corrosivity, shrink-swell potential,
available water capacity, and other behavioral characteristics affecting engineering
uses.
This information can be used to evaluate the potential of areas for residential,
commercial, industrial, and recreational uses; make preliminary estimates of
construction conditions; evaluate alternative routes for roads, streets, highways,
pipelines, and underground cables; evaluate alternative sites for sanitary landfills,
septic tank absorption fields, and sewage lagoons; plan detailed onsite investigations
of soils and geology; locate potential sources of gravel, sand, reclamation material,
roadfill, and topsoil; plan structures for water management; and predict performance of
proposed small structures and pavements by comparing the performance of existing
similar structures on the same or similar soils.
