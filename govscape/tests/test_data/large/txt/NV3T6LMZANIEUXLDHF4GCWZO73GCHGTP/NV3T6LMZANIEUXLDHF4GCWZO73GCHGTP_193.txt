182 Soil Survey of
Genesis, soil. The mode of origin of the soil. Refers especially to the processes or
soil-forming factors responsible for the formation of the solum, or true soil, from
the unconsolidated parent material.
Geosol. A buried soil that formed on a landscape in the past with distinctive
morphological features resulting from a soil-forming environment that no longer
exists at the site. The former pedogenic process was interrupted by burial. A
geosol is a laterally traceable, mappable, geologic weathering profile that has a
consistent stratigraphic position. See Paleosol.
Gilgai. Commonly, a succession of microbasins and microknolls in nearly level areas
or of microvalleys and microridges parallel with the slope. Typically, the microrelief
of clayey soils that shrink and swell considerably with changes in moisture
content.
Glacial (geology). The term embraces both the processes and results of erosion and
deposition arising from the presence of an ice mass (glacier) on a landscape.
Glacial lake (relict). An area formerly occupied by a glacial lake. See Glaciolacustrine
deposits.
Glaciofluvial deposits. Material moved by glaciers and subsequently sorted and
deposited by streams flowing from the melting ice. The deposits are stratified and
occur in the form of outwash plains, valley trains, deltas, kames, eskers, and kame
terraces.
Glaciolacustrine deposits. Material ranging from fine clay to sand derived from
glaciers and deposited in glacial lakes mainly by glacial meltwater. Many deposits
are bedded or laminated.
Glasford Formation (geology). Encompasses all till members of Illinoian age in
Illinois.
Gleyed soil. Soil that formed under poor drainage, resulting in the reduction of iron
and other elements in the profile and in gray colors.
Graded stripcropping. Growing crops in strips that grade toward a protected
waterway.
Grassed waterway. A natural or constructed waterway, typically broad and shallow,
seeded to grass as protection against erosion. Conducts surface water away from
cropland.
Gravel. Rounded or angular fragments of rock as much as 3 inches (2 millimeters to
7.6 centimeters) in diameter. An individual piece is a pebble.
Gravelly soil material. Material that has 15 to 35 percent, by volume, rounded or
angular rock fragments, not prominently flattened, as much as 3 inches (7.6
centimeters) in diameter.
Green manure crop (agronomy). A soil-improving crop grown to be plowed under in
an early stage of maturity or soon after maturity.
Ground moraine. An extensive, fairly even layer of till having an uneven or undulating
surface.
Ground water. Water filling all the unblocked pores of the material below the water
table.
Gully. A small channel with steep sides caused by erosion and cut in unconsolidated
materials by concentrated but intermittent flow of water. The distinction between a
gully and a rill is one of depth. A gully generally is an obstacle to farm machinery
and is too deep to be obliterated by ordinary tillage; a rill is of lesser depth and can
be smoothed over by ordinary tillage.
Haeger Member (geology). The coarse grained, uppermost unit of diamicton in the
Lemont Formation. The Haeger Member consists of calcareous, light gray to gray,
gravelly sandy loam diamicton that contains lenses of gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
Hard bedrock. Bedrock that cannot be excavated except by blasting or by the use of
special equipment that is not commonly used in construction.
