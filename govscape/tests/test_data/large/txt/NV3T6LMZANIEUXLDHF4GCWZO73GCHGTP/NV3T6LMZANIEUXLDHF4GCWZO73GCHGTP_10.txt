Foreword
This soil survey contains information that can be used in land-planning programs in
Douglas County. It contains predictions of soil behavior for selected land uses. The
survey also highlights limitations and hazards inherent in the soil, improvements
needed to overcome the limitations, and the impact of selected land uses on the
environment.
This soil survey is designed for many different users. Farmers, foresters, and
agronomists can use it to evaluate the potential of the soil and the management
needed to protect the soil resource base. Planners, community officials, engineers,
developers, builders, and home buyers can use the survey to plan land use, select
sites for construction, and identify special practices needed to ensure proper
performance. Conservationists, teachers, students, and specialists in recreation,
wildlife management, waste disposal, and pollution control can use the survey to help
them understand, protect, and enhance the environment.
Great differences in soil properties can occur within short distances. Some soils are
seasonally wet or subject to flooding. Some are shallow to bedrock. Some are too
unstable to be used as a foundation for buildings or roads. Clayey or wet soils are
poorly suited to use as septic tank absorption fields. A high water table makes a soil
poorly suited to basements or underground installations.
These and many other soil properties that affect land use are described in this soil
survey. The location of each soil is shown on the detailed soil maps. Each soil in the
survey area is described, and information on specific uses is given. Help in using this
publication and additional information are available at the local office of the Natural
Resources Conservation Service or the Cooperative Extension Service.
