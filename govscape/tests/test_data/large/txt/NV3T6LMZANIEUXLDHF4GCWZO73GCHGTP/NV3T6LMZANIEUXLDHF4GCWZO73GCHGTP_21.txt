formation, calcium carbonate is leached from till, and the material becomes more acid
and less dense.
The till nearest the surface in Douglas County was deposited during the
Woodfordian Substage of the Wisconsinan Stage, the most recent glaciation to reach
Illinois (Willman and Frye, 1970). This glaciation occurred between 22,000 and 12,500
years ago. Most of these surficial till deposits are part of the Batestown Member of the
Lemont Formation, but the western edge of Douglas County is identified as the Piatt
Member of the Tiskilwa Formation and the southeast corner is identified as the
Delavan Member of the Tiskilwa Formation (Hansel and Johnson, 1996).
Most areas of Douglas County are covered by loess of various thicknesses. Dana,
Flanagan, and Xenia soils formed in loess and in the underlying till (fig. 6). Soils that
formed entirely in till are generally on strongly sloping to very steep side slopes (fig. 7).
Senachwine soils are examples.
Loess is material transported and deposited by wind. It consists of uniform,
calcareous, silt-sized particles. The meltwaters from the glaciers carried vast
quantities of silt, which were deposited in the major river valleys. As these sediments
were exposed when the meltwaters subsided, the winds carried the silts and deposited
them over much of the land. Most of the soils in the county formed at least partially in
loess. The thickness of the loess ranges from nearly zero in areas where slopes are
very steep to about 3 to 5 feet in the nearly level areas on uplands. Flanagan soils, for
example, formed on uplands in 40 to 60 inches of loess and in the underlying till.
Outwash is stratified material deposited by glacial meltwaters. The size of the
particles that constitute outwash varies, depending on the velocity of the moving water.
The coarser material was deposited nearer to the ice or in rapidly flowing glacial
streams. Most of the outwash deposits were later covered by loess. Areas of outwash
in Douglas County occur on stream terraces and in the delta area of Glacial Lake
