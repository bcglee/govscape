that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or
minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate
maintenance can be expected. Very limited indicates that the soil has one or more
features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be
overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation
procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.
Numerical ratings in the table indicate the severity of individual limitations. The
ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate
gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact
on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).
Pond reservoir areas hold water behind a dam or embankment. Soils best suited to
this use have low seepage potential in the upper 60 inches. The seepage potential is
determined by the permeability of the soil and the depth to fractured bedrock or other
permeable material. Excessive slope can affect the storage capacity of the reservoir
area.
Embankments, dikes, and levees are raised structures of soil material, generally
less than 20 feet high, constructed to impound water or to protect land against
overflow. Embankments that have zoned construction (core and shell) are not
considered. In this table, the soils are rated as a source of material for embankment
fill. The ratings apply to the soil material below the surface layer to a depth of about 5
feet. It is assumed that soil layers will be uniformly mixed and compacted during
construction.
The ratings do not indicate the ability of the natural soil to support an embankment.
Soil properties to a depth even greater than the height of the embankment can affect
performance and safety of the embankment. Generally, deeper onsite investigation is
needed to determine these properties.
Soil material in embankments must be resistant to seepage, piping, and erosion
and have favorable compaction characteristics. Unfavorable features include less than
5 feet of suitable material and a high content of stones or boulders, organic matter, or
salts or sodium. A high water table affects the amount of usable material. It also affects
trafficability.
Aquifer-fed excavated ponds are pits or dugouts that extend to a ground-water
aquifer or to a depth below a permanent water table. Excluded are ponds that are fed
only by surface runoff and embankment ponds that impound water 3 feet or more
above the original surface. Excavated ponds are affected by depth to a permanent
water table, permeability of the aquifer, and quality of the water as inferred from the
salinity of the soil. Depth to bedrock and the content of large stones affect the ease of
excavation.
Grassed waterways and surface drains are natural or constructed channels,
generally broad and shallow, that conduct surface water to outlets at a nonerosive
velocity. Large stones, wetness, slope, and depth to bedrock affect the construction of
grassed waterways and surface drains. A hazard of wind erosion, low available water
capacity, restricted rooting depth, toxic substances such as salts and sodium, and
restricted permeability adversely affect the growth and maintenance of the grass after
construction.
Terraces and diversions are embankments or a combination of channels and ridges
constructed across a slope to control erosion and conserve moisture by intercepting
runoff. Slope, wetness, large stones, and depth to bedrock affect the construction of
terraces and diversions. A restricted rooting depth, a severe hazard of wind erosion or
water erosion, an excessively coarse texture, and restricted permeability adversely
affect maintenance.
Drainage is the removal of excess surface and subsurface water from the soil. How
easily and effectively the soil is drained depends on the depth to bedrock or other
layers affecting the rate of water movement; permeability; depth to a high water table,
