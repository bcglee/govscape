146 Soil Survey of
Land Capability Classification
Land capability classification shows, in a general way, the suitability of soils for most
kinds of field crops. Crops that require special management are excluded. The soils
are grouped according to their limitations for field crops, the risk of damage if they are
used for crops, and the way they respond to management. The criteria used in
grouping the soils do not include major and generally expensive landforming that
would change slope, depth, or other characteristics of the soils, nor do they include
possible but unlikely major reclamation projects. Capability classification is not a
substitute for interpretations designed to show suitability and limitations of groups of
soils for forestland or for engineering purposes.
In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels—capability
class, subclass, and unit (USDA, 1961). Only class and subclass are used in this
survey.
Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through
8. The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for
practical use. The classes are defined as follows:
Class 1 soils have slight limitations that restrict their use.
Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that restrict the choice of plants or that
require moderate conservation practices.
Class 3 soils have severe limitations that restrict the choice of plants or that require
special conservation practices, or both.
Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that restrict the choice of plants or that
require very careful management, or both.
Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical
to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, forestland, or wildlife habitat.
Class 6 soils have severe limitations that make them generally unsuitable for
cultivation and that restrict their use mainly to pasture, forestland, or wildlife habitat.
Class 7 soils have very severe limitations that make them unsuitable for cultivation
and that restrict their use mainly to grazing, forestland, or wildlife habitat.
Class 8 soils and miscellaneous areas have limitations that preclude commercial
plant production and that restrict their use to recreational purposes, wildlife habitat,
watershed, or esthetic purposes.
Capability subclasses are soil groups within one class. They are designated by
adding a small letter, e, w, s, or c, to the class numeral, for example, 2e. The letter e
shows that the main hazard is the risk of erosion unless close-growing plant cover is
maintained; w shows that water in or on the soil interferes with plant growth or
cultivation (in some soils the wetness can be partly corrected by artificial drainage); s
shows that the soil is limited mainly because it is shallow, droughty, or stony; and c,
used in only some parts of the United States, shows that the chief limitation is climate
that is very cold or very dry.
In class 1 there are no subclasses because the soils of this class have few
limitations. Class 5 contains only the subclasses indicated by w, s, or c because the
soils in class 5 are subject to little or no erosion.
Capability units are soil groups within a subclass. The soils in a capability unit are
enough alike to be suited to the same crops and pasture plants, to require similar
management, and to have similar productivity. Capability units are generally
designated by adding an Arabic numeral to the subclass symbol, for example, 2e-4
and 3e-6.
The capability classification of the soils in this survey area is given in the section
“Soil Series and Detailed Soil Map Units” and in the yields table.
