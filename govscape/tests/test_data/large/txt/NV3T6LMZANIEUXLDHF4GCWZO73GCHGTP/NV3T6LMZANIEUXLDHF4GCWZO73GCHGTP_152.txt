A combination of conservation measures, including special tillage practices,
incorporation of organic material, and crop selection, can help to overcome this
limitation.
Water erosion is a hazard in areas of pastureland if the erosion factor (Kw)
multiplied by the percent slope is greater than 1.0 and the slope is greater than or
equal to 3 percent. Water erosion can occur in overgrazed areas or during pasture
establishment and renovation if the surface soil is not protected against the impact of
raindrops. Erosion causes poor tilth, which reduces the rate of water infiltration and
increases the rate of surface runoff. Water erosion reduces the productivity of the soil.
It results in sediments, livestock manure, and added nutrients entering streams, rivers,
water impoundments, and road ditches.
Soils with long or steep slopes are more susceptible than other soils to water
erosion. Rotation grazing helps to control erosion by preventing overgrazing, which
can cause surface compaction and excessive runoff. Other methods of reducing the
hazard of erosion include tilling on the contour, using a no-till system of seeding during
pasture establishment or renovation, and selecting adapted forage and hay varieties.
Dana, Octagon, Senachwine, and Xenia soils are examples of soils that are subject to
water erosion.
Wetness is a limitation if the seasonal high water table is within a depth of 1.5 feet.
Wetness is a management concern on about 82 percent of the acreage used for crops
and pasture in Douglas County. Some soils are naturally so wet that the production of
crops is not possible unless a drainage system is installed. The poorly drained
Drummer, Hartsburg, Milford, and Sawmill soils are examples of soils that are subject
to wetness. Seasonal wetness in areas of somewhat poorly drained soils, such as
Flanagan, Shaffton, Raub, Sabina, Starks, Sunbury, and Rutland soils, can delay
planting in wet years.
Erosion Control
Generally, a combination of several practices is needed to control erosion.
Conservation tillage, including chisel tillage and no-till, are common in Douglas County.
Contour stripcropping, contour farming, conservation cropping systems, crop residue
management, terraces, diversions, buffer strips, riparian areas, bendway weirs
(fig. 12), and grassed waterways help to prevent excessive soil loss.
The loss of the surface layer through erosion causes damage in two ways. First,
productivity is reduced as the surface layer is lost and part of the subsoil is
incorporated into the plow layer. The subsoil generally has fewer plant nutrients, a
lower content of organic matter, and a higher content of clay than the surface layer. As
the content of organic matter in the tilled layer decreases and the clay content
increases, soil tilth is reduced. The deterioration of soil tilth increases the likelihood
that a crust will form on the surface and that the rate of water infiltration will be
reduced. The higher content of clay increases the likelihood that the surface layer will
become cloddy when tilled, especially if tilled when wet. The cloddiness makes it
difficult to prepare a seedbed. Puddling is common in eroded areas after hard rains,
and a crust may form on the surface of the soil as it dries. The runoff rate increases as
a result. Loss of the surface layer is especially damaging on soils that have a clayey
subsoil, such as Sabina soils; on soils that tend to be droughty; and on soils that are
moderately eroded, such as Senachwine soils. Second, erosion on farmland results in
the sedimentation and pollution of streams. Controlling erosion minimizes this pollution
and improves the quality of water for municipal and recreational uses and for fish and
other wildlife.
Erosion-control measures provide a protective plant cover, increase the rate of
water infiltration, and reduce the runoff rate. A cropping system that keeps plants on
the surface for extended periods reduces the hazard of erosion and preserves the
productive capacity of the soils. Including forage crops, such as grasses and legumes,
