Douglas and Moultrie Counties are well known for their Amish settlements. The first
Amish immigrants arrived in the area in 1865 from Pennsylvania (Miller, 1980). The
previous year, Bishop Joel Beachy of Maryland and Moses Yoder of Pennsylvania
started west to find a location where they could raise a crop without liming the soil.
After exploring locations in several states, they selected an area near the present town
of Arthur. The Amish are primarily farmers (fig. 2), but other industries include canning,
butchering, and carpentry.
