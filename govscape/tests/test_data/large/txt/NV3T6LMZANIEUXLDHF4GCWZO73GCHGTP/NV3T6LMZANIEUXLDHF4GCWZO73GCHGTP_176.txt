Depth to the upper and lower boundaries of each layer is indicated.
Particle size is the effective diameter of a soil particle as measured by
sedimentation, sieving, or micrometric methods. Particle sizes are expressed as
classes with specific effective diameter class limits. The broad classes are sand, silt,
and clay, ranging from the larger to the smaller.
Sand as a soil separate consists of mineral soil particles that are 0.05 millimeter to
2 millimeters in diameter. In the table, the estimated sand content of each soil layer is
given as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 millimeters in
diameter.
Silt as a soil separate consists of mineral soil particles that are 0.002 to 0.05
millimeter in diameter. In the table, the estimated silt content of each soil layer is given
as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 millimeters in
diameter.
Clay as a soil separate consists of mineral soil particles that are less than 0.002
millimeter in diameter. In the table, the estimated clay content of each soil layer is
given as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 millimeters in
diameter.
The content of sand, silt, and clay affects the physical behavior of a soil. Particle
size is important for engineering and agronomic interpretations, for determination of
soil hydrologic qualities, and for soil classification.
The amount and kind of clay affect the fertility and physical condition of the soil and
the ability of the soil to adsorb cations and to retain moisture. They influence shrink-
swell potential, permeability, plasticity, the ease of soil dispersion, and other soil
properties. The amount and kind of clay in a soil also affect tillage and earthmoving
operations.
Moist bulk density is the weight of soil (ovendry) per unit volume. Volume is
measured when the soil is at field moisture capacity, that is, the moisture content at
1/ - or 1/ -bar (33kPa or 10kPa) moisture tension. Weight is determined after the soil is

dried at 105 degrees C. In the table, the estimated moist bulk density of each soil
horizon is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter of soil material that is less than 2
millimeters in diameter. Bulk density data are used to compute shrink-swell potential,
available water capacity, total pore space, and other soil properties. The moist bulk
density of a soil indicates the pore space available for water and roots. Depending on
soil texture, a bulk density of more than 1.4 can restrict water storage and root
penetration. Moist bulk density is influenced by texture, kind of clay, content of organic
matter, and soil structure.
Permeability (K ) refers to the ability of a soil to transmit water or air. The term
sat
“permeability,” as used in soil surveys, indicates saturated hydraulic conductivity (K ).
sat
The estimates in the table indicate the rate of water movement, in inches per hour,
when the soil is saturated. They are based on soil characteristics observed in the field,
particularly structure, porosity, and texture. Permeability is considered in the design of
soil drainage systems and septic tank absorption fields.
Available water capacity refers to the quantity of water that the soil is capable of
storing for use by plants. The capacity for water storage is given in inches of water per
inch of soil for each soil layer. The capacity varies, depending on soil properties that
affect retention of water. The most important properties are the content of organic
matter, soil texture, bulk density, and soil structure. Available water capacity is an
important factor in the choice of plants or crops to be grown and in the design and
management of irrigation systems. Available water capacity is not an estimate of the
quantity of water actually available to plants at any given time.
Linear extensibility refers to the change in length of an unconfined clod as moisture
content is decreased from a moist to a dry state. It is an expression of the volume
change between the water content of the clod at 1/ - or 1/ -bar tension (33kPa or
