surface stoniness, and flooding. Soil temperature and soil moisture also are
considerations. Examples of grain and seed crops are corn, wheat, oats, and barley.
Grasses and legumes are domestic perennial grasses and herbaceous legumes.
Soil properties and features that affect the growth of grasses and legumes are depth
of the root zone, texture of the surface layer, available water capacity, wetness, surface
stoniness, flooding, and slope. Soil temperature and soil moisture also are
considerations. Examples of grasses and legumes are lovegrass, orchardgrass,
bromegrass, clover, and alfalfa.
Wild herbaceous plants are native or naturally established grasses and forbs,
including weeds. Soil properties and features that affect the growth of these plants are
depth of the root zone, texture of the surface layer, available water capacity, wetness,
surface stoniness, and flooding. Soil temperature and soil moisture also are
considerations. Examples of wild herbaceous plants are bluestem, goldenrod,
ragweed, wildrye, and Illinois bundleflower.
Hardwood trees and woody understory produce nuts or other fruit, buds, catkins,
twigs, bark, and foliage. Soil properties and features that affect the growth of hardwood
trees and shrubs are depth of the root zone, available water capacity, and wetness.
Examples of these plants are oak, hickory, sycamore, cottonwood, elm, sassafras,
serviceberry, gray dogwood, flowering dogwood, hazelnut, sumac, and raspberry.
Examples of native plants that are suitable for planting on soils rated good are
hazelnut, gray dogwood, silky dogwood, oak, and hickory.
Coniferous plants furnish browse and seeds. Soil properties and features that affect
the growth of coniferous trees, shrubs, and ground cover are depth of the root zone,
available water capacity, and wetness. Examples of coniferous plants are white pine,
Norway spruce, balsam fir, red cedar, and juniper.
