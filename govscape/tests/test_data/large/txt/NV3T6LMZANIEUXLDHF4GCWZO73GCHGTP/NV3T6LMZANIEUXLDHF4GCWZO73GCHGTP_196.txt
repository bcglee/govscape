Douglas County, Illinois 185
Intermittent stream. A stream, or reach of a stream, that does not flow year-round but
that is commonly dry for 3 or more months out of 12 and whose channel is
generally below the local water table. It flows only during wet periods or when it
receives ground-water discharge or long, continued contributions from melting
snow or other surface and shallow subsurface sources.
Iron depletions. See Redoximorphic features.
Irrigation. Application of water to soils to assist in production of crops. Methods of
irrigation are:
Controlled flooding.—Water is released at intervals from closely spaced field
ditches and distributed uniformly over the field.
Drip (or trickle).—Water is applied slowly and under low pressure to the surface of
the soil or into the soil through such applicators as emitters, porous tubing, or
perforated pipe.
Sprinkler.—Water is sprayed over the soil surface through pipes or nozzles from a
pressure system.
Kame. A low mound, knob, hummock, or short irregular ridge composed of stratified
sand and gravel deposited by a subglacial stream as a fan or delta at the margin
of a melting glacier; by a supraglacial stream in a low place or hole on the surface
of the glacier; or as a ponded deposit on the surface or at the margin of stagnant
ice.
Knoll. A small, low, rounded hill rising above adjacent landforms.
K . Saturated hydraulic conductivity. (See Permeability.)
sat
Lacustrine deposit. Material deposited in lake water and exposed when the water
level is lowered or the elevation of the land is raised.
Lake plain. A nearly level surface marking the floor of an extinct lake filled by well
sorted, generally fine textured, stratified deposits, commonly containing varves.
Lake terrace. A narrow shelf, partly cut and partly built, produced along a lakeshore in
front of a scarp line of low cliffs and later exposed when the water level falls.
Landscape. A collection of related natural landforms; usually the land surface which
the eye can comprehend in a single view.
Large stones (in tables). Rock fragments 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) or more across.
Large stones adversely affect the specified use of the soil.
Leaching. The removal of soluble material from soil or other material by percolating
water.
Lemont Formation (geology). The Lemont Formation of the Wedron Group is the
succession of fine textured to coarse textured gray diamicton units that overlie the
Tiskilwa Formation. It has four differentiated members—the Lemont Member, the
Batestown Member, the Yorkville Member, and the Haeger Member. In northern
Illinois, the Lemont Formation is not subdivided. The Lemont Formation consists of
calcareous, gray, fine textured to coarse textured diamicton units that contain
lenses of gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
Linear extensibility. Refers to the change in length of an unconfined clod as moisture
content is decreased from a moist to a dry state. Linear extensibility is used to
determine the shrink-swell potential of soils. It is an expression of the volume
change between the water content of the clod at 1/ - or 1/ -bar tension (33kPa or
3 10
10kPa tension) and oven dryness. Volume change is influenced by the amount and
type of clay minerals in the soil. The volume change is the percent change for the
whole soil. If it is expressed as a fraction, the resulting value is COLE, coefficient
of linear extensibility.
Liquid limit. The moisture content at which the soil passes from a plastic to a liquid
state.
Loam. Soil material that is 7 to 27 percent clay particles, 28 to 50 percent silt particles,
and less than 52 percent sand particles.
