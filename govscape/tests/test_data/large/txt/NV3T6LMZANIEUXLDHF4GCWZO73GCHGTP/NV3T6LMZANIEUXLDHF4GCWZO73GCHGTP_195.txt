184 Soil Survey of
Humus. The well decomposed, more or less stable part of the organic matter in
mineral soils.
Hydrologic soil groups. Refers to soils grouped according to their runoff potential.
The soil properties that influence this potential are those that affect the minimum
rate of water infiltration on a bare soil during periods after prolonged wetting when
the soil is not frozen. These properties are depth to a seasonal high water table,
the infiltration rate and permeability after prolonged wetting, and depth to a very
slowly permeable layer. The slope and the kind of plant cover are not considered
but are separate factors in predicting runoff.
Igneous rock. Rock that was formed by cooling and solidification of magma and that
has not been changed appreciably by weathering since its formation. Major
varieties include plutonic and volcanic rock (e.g., andesite, basalt, and granite).
Illinoian (geology). In Illinois, represents the glacial age of ice advance preceding the
Sangamonian and Wisconsinan and following the Yarmouthian and pre-Illinoian
during the Pleistocene. This glaciation practically covered the entire State of Illinois
with the exception of small portions in northwestern, western, and southern
Illinois. See Pleistocene.
Illuviation. The movement of soil material from one horizon to another in the soil
profile. Generally, material is removed from an upper horizon and deposited in a
lower horizon.
Impervious soil. A soil through which water, air, or roots penetrate slowly or not at all.
No soil is absolutely impervious to air and water all the time.
Infiltration. The downward entry of water into the immediate surface of soil or other
material, as contrasted with percolation, which is movement of water through soil
layers or material.
Infiltration capacity. The maximum rate at which water can infiltrate into a soil under
a given set of conditions.
Infiltration rate. The rate at which water penetrates the surface of the soil at any given
instant, usually expressed in inches per hour. The rate can be limited by the
infiltration capacity of the soil or the rate at which water is applied at the surface.
Intake rate. The average rate of water entering the soil under irrigation. Most soils
have a fast initial rate; the rate decreases with application time. Therefore, intake
rate for design purposes is not a constant but is a variable depending on the net
irrigation application. The rate of water intake, in inches per hour, is expressed as
follows:
Less than 0.2.................................................very low
0.2 to 0.4................................................................ low
0.4 to 0.75...........................................moderately low
0.75 to 1.25..................................................moderate
1.25 to 1.75....................................... moderately high
1.75 to 2.5.............................................................high
More than 2.5 ...............................................very high
Interfluve. A landform composed of the relatively undissected upland or ridge
between two adjacent valleys containing streams flowing in the same general
direction. An elevated area between two drainageways that sheds water to those
drainageways.
Interfluve (geomorphology). A geomorphic component of hills consisting of the
uppermost, comparatively level or gently sloping area of a hill; shoulders of
backwearing hillslopes can narrow the upland or can merge, resulting in a strongly
convex shape.
Interglacial. A period of time between major glacial stages. See Holocene,
Sangamonian, and Yarmouthian.
