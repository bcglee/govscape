Douglas County, Illinois 195
Tuff. A generic term for any consolidated or cemented deposit that is 50 percent or
more volcanic ash.
Upland. An informal, general term for the higher ground of a region, in contrast with a
low-lying adjacent area, such as a valley or plain, or for land at a higher elevation
than the flood plain or low stream terrace; land above the footslope zone of the
hillslope continuum.
Valley fill. In glaciated regions, material deposited in stream valleys by glacial
meltwater. In nonglaciated regions, alluvium deposited by heavily loaded streams.
Vandalia Till Member (geology). The Vandalia Till Member of the Glasford Formation
consists of clay loam diamicton. It is generally gray and calcareous, except where
weathered. It is commonly 25 to 30 feet thick and is bounded at the top by the
Sangamon Geosol.
Variegation. Refers to patterns of contrasting colors assumed to be inherited from the
parent material rather than to be the result of poor drainage.
Varve. A sedimentary layer or a lamina or sequence of laminae deposited in a body of
still water within a year. Specifically, a thin pair of graded glaciolacustrine layers
seasonally deposited, usually by meltwater streams, in a glacial lake or other body
of still water in front of a glacier.
Wasco facies (geology). An informal separation of the Henry Formation. Consists of
poorly sorted sand and gravel outwash deposits on kames, eskers, and deltas.
Water bars. Smooth, shallow ditches or depressional areas that are excavated at an
angle across a sloping road. They are used to reduce the downward velocity of
water and divert it off and away from the road surface. Water bars can easily be
driven over if constructed properly.
Weathering. All physical disintegration, chemical decomposition, and biologically
induced changes in rocks or other deposits at or near the earthâ€™s surface by
atmospheric or biologic agents or by circulating surface waters but involving
essentially no transport of the altered material.
Wedron Group (geology). Mostly diamicton of the Wisconsinan Age.
Well graded. Refers to soil material consisting of coarse grained particles that are well
distributed over a wide range in size or diameter. Such soil normally can be easily
increased in density and bearing properties by compaction. Contrasts with poorly
graded soil.
Wilting point (or permanent wilting point). The moisture content of soil, on an
ovendry basis, at which a plant (specifically a sunflower) wilts so much that it does
not recover when placed in a humid, dark chamber.
Windthrow. The uprooting and tipping over of trees by the wind.
Wisconsinan (geology). In Illinois, represents the last glacial stage of ice advance
during the Pleistocene. Follows the Sangamonian interglacial stage. See
Pleistocene.
Yarmouthian (geology). In Illinois, represents an interglacial stage between the pre-
Illinoian and Illinoian glacial stages during the Pleistocene. See Pleistocene.
Yorkville Member (geology). The middle unit of diamicton in the Lemont Formation.
The Yorkville Member generally consists of calcareous, gray, fine textured (silty
clay to silty clay loam) diamicton that contains lenses of gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
It typically oxidizes to olive brown. Locally, the Yorkville Member is coarser
texturally and therefore similar to the Batestown Member.
