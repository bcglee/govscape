Ponding. Standing water on soils in closed depressions. Unless the soils are
artificially drained, the water can be removed only by percolation or
evapotranspiration.
Poorly graded. Refers to a coarse grained soil or soil material consisting mainly of
particles of nearly the same size. Because there is little difference in size of the
particles, density can be increased only slightly by compaction.
Pore linings. See Redoximorphic features.
Potential native plant community. See Climax plant community.
Potential rooting depth (effective rooting depth). Depth to which roots could
penetrate if the content of moisture in the soil were adequate. The soil has no
properties restricting the penetration of roots to this depth.
Prescribed burning. Deliberately burning an area for specific management purposes,
under the appropriate conditions of weather and soil moisture and at the proper
time of day.
Productivity, soil. The capability of a soil for producing a specified plant or sequence
of plants under specific management.
Profile, soil. A vertical section of the soil extending through all its horizons and into
the parent material.
Proper grazing use. Grazing at an intensity that maintains enough cover to protect
the soil and maintain or improve the quantity and quality of the desirable
vegetation. This practice increases the vigor and reproduction capacity of the key
plants and promotes the accumulation of litter and mulch necessary to conserve
soil and water.
Quaternary (geology). The latest period of time in the stratigraphic column, about 0 to
2 million years before present, represented by local accumulations of glacial
(Pleistocene) and postglacial (Holocene) deposits. An artificial division of time
used to separate pre-human from post-human sedimentation.
Reaction, soil. A measure of acidity or alkalinity of a soil, expressed as pH values. A
soil that tests to pH 7.0 is described as precisely neutral in reaction because it is
neither acid nor alkaline. The degrees of acidity or alkalinity, expressed as pH
values, are:
Ultra acid.................................................less than 3.5
Extremely acid.............................................3.5 to 4.4
Very strongly acid........................................4.5 to 5.0
Strongly acid................................................5.1 to 5.5
Moderately acid...........................................5.6 to 6.0
Slightly acid.................................................6.1 to 6.5
Neutral .........................................................6.6 to 7.3
Slightly alkaline ...........................................7.4 to 7.8
Moderately alkaline.....................................7.9 to 8.4
Strongly alkaline..........................................8.5 to 9.0
Very strongly alkaline..........................9.1 and higher
Red beds. Sedimentary strata that are mainly red and are made up largely of
sandstone and shale.
Redoximorphic concentrations. See Redoximorphic features.
Redoximorphic depletions. See Redoximorphic features.
Redoximorphic features. Redoximorphic features are associated with wetness and
result from alternating periods of reduction and oxidation of iron and manganese
compounds in the soil. Reduction occurs during saturation with water, and
oxidation occurs when the soil is not saturated. Characteristic color patterns are
created by these processes. The reduced iron and manganese ions may be
removed from a soil if vertical or lateral fluxes of water occur, in which case there
is no iron or manganese precipitation in that soil. Wherever the iron and
