188 Soil Survey of
100 square feet (1 square meter to 10 square meters), depending on the variability
of the soil.
Peoria Silt (geology). Light yellowish tan to gray, calcareous silt that grades from a
sandy silt in the bluffs to a clayey silt away from the bluffs. Also known as Peoria
loess. Covers most of Illinois and ranges in thickness from 80 feet in bluff areas
along the Mississippi River to 1 or 2 feet away from bluff areas. Deposition
occurred 25,000 to 12,500 radiocarbon years ago.
Percolation. The movement of water through the soil.
Permafrost. Ground, soil, or rock that remains at or below 0 degrees C for at least 2
years. It is defined on the basis of temperature and is not necessarily frozen.
Permeability. The quality of the soil that enables water or air to move downward
through the profile. The rate at which a saturated soil transmits water is accepted
as a measure of this quality. In soil physics, the rate is referred to as “saturated
hydraulic conductivity,” which is defined in the “Soil Survey Manual.” In line with
conventional usage in the engineering profession and with traditional usage in
published soil surveys, this rate of flow continues to be expressed as
“permeability.” Terms describing permeability, measured in inches per hour, are as
follows:
Impermeable.............................less than 0.0015 inch
Very slow.....................................0.0015 to 0.06 inch
Slow ...................................................0.06 to 0.2 inch
Moderately slow...................................0.2 to 0.6 inch
Moderate..................................0.6 inch to 2.0 inches
Moderately rapid..............................2.0 to 6.0 inches
Rapid................................................. 6.0 to 20 inches
Very rapid...................................more than 20 inches
pH value. A numerical designation of acidity and alkalinity in soil. (See Reaction, soil.)
Phase, soil. A subdivision of a soil series based on features that affect its use and
management, such as slope, stoniness, and flooding.
Piatt Member (geology). The upper diamicton facies of the Tiskilwa Formation
deposited between 19,000 and 18,500 radiocarbon years ago. The Piatt Member
consists of gray loam diamicton containing lenses of sorted sediment. Textures
vary, especially near the surface, where it is often interbedded with stratified
sediment.
Piping (in tables). Formation of subsurface tunnels or pipelike cavities by water
moving through the soil.
Pitting (in tables). Pits caused by melting around ice. They form on the soil after plant
cover is removed.
Plastic limit. The moisture content at which a soil changes from semisolid to plastic.
Plasticity index. The numerical difference between the liquid limit and the plastic limit;
the range of moisture content within which the soil remains plastic.
Pleistocene (geology). The period in a geologic time series that encompasses all
glacial and interglacial stages. Includes the Wisconsinan, Sangamonian, Illinoian,
Yarmouthian, and pre-Illinoian. The period covered is about 12,600 to 2 million
years before present.
Plinthite. The sesquioxide-rich, humus-poor, highly weathered mixture of clay with
quartz and other diluents. It commonly appears as red mottles, usually in platy,
polygonal, or reticulate patterns. Plinthite changes irreversibly to an ironstone
hardpan or to irregular aggregates on repeated wetting and drying, especially if it
is exposed also to heat from the sun. In a moist soil, plinthite can be cut with a
spade. It is a form of laterite.
Plowpan. A compacted layer formed in the soil directly below the plowed layer.
