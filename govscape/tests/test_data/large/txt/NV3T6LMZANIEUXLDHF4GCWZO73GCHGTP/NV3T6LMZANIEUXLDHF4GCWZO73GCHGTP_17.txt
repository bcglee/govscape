6 Soil Survey of
Figure 5.—The forestland in the lower positions along the Kaskaskia River is in an area of
Shaffton and Sawmill soils.
Oil and gas fields west of Interstate 57 and in a small area near Murdock have
mostly been capped. Natural gas storage areas are located west of Interstate 57
(Illinois State Geological Survey, 2005).
Coal was a considerable resource in Douglas County until 1991, when the shaft and
slope mine near Murdock closed. The area is now identified on the soil maps as
Orthents, loamy-skeletal, acid, steep (Illinois State Geological Survey, 2005).
Climate
Table 1 gives data on temperature and precipitation for the survey area as recorded
at Tuscola in the period 1971 to 2000. Table 2 shows probable dates of the first freeze
in fall and the last freeze in spring. Table 3 provides data on the length of the growing
season.
In winter, the average temperature is 29.8 degrees F and the average daily
minimum temperature is 21.3 degrees. The lowest temperature on record, which
occurred at Tuscola on December 22, 1989, was -26 degrees. In summer, the average
temperature is 74.8 degrees and the average daily maximum temperature is 86.6
degrees. The highest temperature, which occurred at Tuscola on July 14, 1954, was
113 degrees.
Growing degree days are shown in table 1. They are equivalent to “heat units.”
During the month, growing degree days accumulate by the amount that the average
temperature each day exceeds a base temperature (50 degrees F). The normal
monthly accumulation is used to schedule single or successive plantings of a crop
between the last freeze in spring and the first freeze in fall.
The average annual total precipitation is 40.58 inches. Of this total, about 26.35
inches, or 65 percent, usually falls in April through October. The growing season for
most crops falls within this period. The heaviest 1-day rainfall during the period of
record was 5.30 inches at Tuscola on August 2, 1978. Thunderstorms occur on about
48 days each year, and most occur between April and August.
The average seasonal snowfall is 22.9 inches. The greatest snow depth at any one
time during the period of record was 20 inches recorded on January 10, 1974. On an
average, 20 days per year have at least 1 inch of snow on the ground. The heaviest
1-day snowfall on record was 15.0 inches recorded on January 31, 1982.
