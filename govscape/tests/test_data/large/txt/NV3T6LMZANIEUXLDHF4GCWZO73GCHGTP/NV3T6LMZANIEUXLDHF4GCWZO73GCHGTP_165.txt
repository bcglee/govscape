154 Soil Survey of
Wetland plants are annual and perennial wild herbaceous plants that grow on moist
or wet sites. Submerged or floating aquatic plants are excluded. Soil properties and
features affecting wetland plants are texture of the surface layer, wetness, reaction,
salinity, slope, and surface stoniness. Examples of wetland plants are smartweed, wild
millet, wildrice, saltgrass, cordgrass, rushes, sedges, and reeds.
Shallow water areas have an average depth of less than 5 feet. Some are naturally
wet areas. Others are created by dams, levees, or other water-control structures. Soil
properties and features affecting shallow water areas are depth to bedrock, wetness,
surface stoniness, slope, and permeability. Examples of shallow water areas are
marshes, waterfowl feeding areas, and ponds.
Shallow water areas can often be included in the design of ponds and lakes by
utilizing the naturally shallow end of the impoundment. Wetland areas can also be
created by installing water-control valves on field drainage tiles, which allows the
flooding of fields between times of crop production, such as after fall harvest. Valves
can be opened to drain fields for spring planting while allowing soil moisture to remain
high enough for good productivity. Islands, wood duck boxes, and an even mix of open
water and aquatic plants help to provide optimum wildlife habitat in permanent wetland
areas.
The habitat for various kinds of wildlife is described in the following paragraphs.
Habitat for openland wildlife consists of cropland, pasture, meadows, and areas that
are overgrown with grasses, herbs, shrubs, and vines. These areas produce grain and
seed crops, grasses and legumes, and wild herbaceous plants. Wildlife attracted to
these areas include bobwhite quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow, cottontail,
and red fox.
Measures that can improve the habitat for openland wildlife include seeding
roadsides, fence rows, and wildlife travel lanes to perennial plants and legumes, such
as smooth bromegrass, timothy, redtop, bluegrass, alfalfa, red clover, ladino clover,
and alsike clover; enhancing grassy areas with perennial native prairie grasses, such
as big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and indiangrass; and protecting nesting
cover from fire, traffic, grazing, mowing, or other disturbance until after the nesting
season.
Warm-season grasses grow best under periodic prescribed burning. Any existing
woody cover should be protected from fire and grazing. Establishing hedgerows and
windbreaks with trees and shrubs that provide a source of food and roosting areas
also enhances the habitat. Piles of brush can provide cover along fence rows and in
oddly shaped areas that are inconvenient for cultivation. Leaving crop residue on the
surface after harvest and leaving waste grain in the fields can provide wildlife with
cover and food throughout the winter. Also, leaving some unharvested areas next to
areas used as cover for wildlife can improve the habitat.
Habitat for woodland wildlife consists of areas of deciduous and/or coniferous plants
and associated grasses, legumes, and wild herbaceous plants. Wildlife attracted to
these areas include woodcock, thrushes, woodpeckers, squirrels, gray fox, raccoon,
and deer.
Measures that can improve the habitat for woodland wildlife include protecting
native trees, shrubs, and prairie plants from grazing by livestock and from uncontrolled
fire; minimizing the destruction of leaf mulch and of desirable young trees, shrubs, and
sprouts that provide food and cover; and establishing hedgerows, farm windbreaks,
brush piles, food plots, and strips of grass or grass-legume mixtures for additional food
and cover. Plantings for food and cover may be difficult to establish and maintain in
sloping areas. Establishing food plots of grain or seed crops in the less sloping areas
and planting on the contour can reduce the hazard of erosion. Leaving dead trees to
provide den sites for raccoons, woodpeckers, opossum, and other cavity-dwelling
species also improves the habitat.
