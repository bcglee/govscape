possible under unusual weather conditions (the chance of ponding is nearly 0 percent
to 5 percent in any year); occasional that it occurs, on the average, once or less in 2
years (the chance of ponding is 5 to 50 percent in any year); and frequent that it
occurs, on the average, more than once in 2 years (the chance of ponding is more
than 50 percent in any year).
Flooding is the temporary inundation of an area caused by overflowing streams, by
runoff from adjacent slopes, or by tides. Water standing for short periods after rainfall
or snowmelt is not considered flooding, and water standing in swamps and marshes is
considered ponding rather than flooding.
Duration and frequency of flooding are estimated. Duration is expressed as
extremely brief if 0.1 hour to 4 hours, very brief if 4 hours to 2 days, brief if 2 to 7 days,
long if 7 to 30 days, and very long if more than 30 days. Frequency is expressed as
none, very rare, rare, occasional, frequent, and very frequent. None means that
flooding is not probable; very rare that it is very unlikely but possible under extremely
unusual weather conditions (the chance of flooding is less than 1 percent in any year);
rare that it is unlikely but possible under unusual weather conditions (the chance of
flooding is 1 to 5 percent in any year); occasional that it occurs infrequently under
normal weather conditions (the chance of flooding is 5 to 50 percent in any year);
frequent that it is likely to occur often under normal weather conditions (the chance of
flooding is more than 50 percent in any year but is less than 50 percent in all months
in any year); and very frequent that it is likely to occur very often under normal weather
conditions (the chance of flooding is more than 50 percent in all months of any year).
The information is based on evidence in the soil profile, namely thin strata of gravel,
sand, silt, or clay deposited by floodwater; irregular decrease in organic matter content
with increasing depth; and little or no horizon development.
Also considered are local information about the extent and levels of flooding and the
relation of each soil on the landscape to historic floods. Information on the extent of
flooding based on soil data is less specific than that provided by detailed engineering
surveys that delineate flood-prone areas at specific flood frequency levels.
Water table refers to a saturated zone in the soil. Table 21 indicates the depth to the
top (upper limit) and base (lower limit) of the saturated zone for the specified months in
most years. Estimates of the upper and lower limits are based mainly on observations
of the water table at selected sites and on evidence of a saturated zone, namely
grayish colors or mottles (redoximorphic features) in the soil. A saturated zone that
lasts for less than a month is not considered a water table.
The table also shows the kind of water table, that is, apparent or perched. An
apparent water table is a thick zone of free water in the soil. It is indicated by the level
at which water stands in an uncased borehole after adequate time is allowed for
adjustment in the surrounding soil. A perched water table is water standing above an
unsaturated zone. In places an upper, or perched, water table is separated from a
lower one by a dry zone.
Soil Features
Table 22 gives estimates of various soil features. The estimates are used in land
use planning that involves engineering considerations.
A restrictive layer is a nearly continuous layer that has one or more physical,
chemical, or thermal properties that significantly impede the movement of water and
air through the soil or that restrict roots or otherwise provide an unfavorable root
environment. Examples are bedrock, cemented layers, dense layers, and frozen
layers. The table indicates the hardness of the restrictive layer, which can significantly
affect the ease of excavation. Depth to top is the vertical distance from the soil surface
to the upper boundary of the restrictive layer.
