Douglas County, Illinois 15
more susceptible to erosion than soils that formed in nearly level or level areas or
where slopes are short. Maintaining a partial or complete cover of vegetation or plant
residue can significantly reduce the hazard of erosion in sloping areas. For example,
Senachwine soils that have slopes of 18 to 60 percent generally support trees,
herbaceous plants, and grasses. Because of the vegetative cover, these soils are
subject to little or no erosion. Most areas of Senachwine soils that have slopes of 2 to
18 percent are cultivated. Failure to maintain erosion-control systems on these soils
has resulted in moderate or severe accelerated erosion of the surface soil. The loss of
surface soil material in one place results in deposition and accumulation in another
place, affecting both the rate of soil formation and the development and thickness of
soil horizons.
Time
To a great extent, time determines the degree of profile development in a soil. The
influence of time, however, is modified by wetness, erosion, the deposition of material,
and local relief.
The differences among soils resulting from the length of time the parent material
has been in place are commonly expressed in the degree of profile development.
Sawmill soils have a very weakly expressed profile because they are on low flood
plains that periodically receive new alluvial sediments. Consequently, they have not
been in place long enough for the development of distinct horizons. Sabina soils,
conversely, which occur on ground moraines, exhibit stronger development than the
Sawmill soils. They have distinct horizons because the loess and underlying till in
which they formed have been in place a much longer time.
In most of the upland soils, enough time has passed to allow the removal of calcium
carbonate from the upper 40 inches of the profile through leaching. However, in
sloping areas, more rainfall tends to run off the surface rather than infiltrate the soil.
Less water available for leaching calcium carbonate results in more calcareous soils.
Examples include Octagon and Senachwine soils, which are calcareous within a depth
of 40 inches.
Classification of the Soils
The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has
six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1998, 1999, and 2003). Beginning with the broadest,
these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series.
Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those
observations or from laboratory measurements. Table 4 shows the classification of the
soils in the county. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.
ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect
the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is
identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Mollisol.
SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of
properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties
that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name
of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udoll (Ud, meaning humid, plus oll,
from Mollisol).
GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close
similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons;
soil moisture and temperature regimes; and base status. Each great group is identified
by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An
example is Argiudolls (Argi, indicating that the soil has an accumulation of clay in the
subsoil, plus udoll, the suborder of the Mollisols that has a udic moisture regime).
