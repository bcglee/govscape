Glossary
Many of the terms relating to landforms, geology, and geomorphology are defined in
more detail in the “National Soil Survey Handbook” (available in local offices of the
Natural Resources Conservation Service or on the Internet).
ABC soil. A soil having an A, a B, and a C horizon.
Ablation till. Loose, relatively permeable earthy material deposited during the
downwasting of nearly static glacial ice, either contained within or accumulated on
the surface of the glacier.
AC soil. A soil having only an A and a C horizon. Commonly, such soil formed in
recent alluvium or on steep, rocky slopes.
Aeration, soil. The exchange of air in soil with air from the atmosphere. The air in a
well aerated soil is similar to that in the atmosphere; the air in a poorly aerated soil
is considerably higher in carbon dioxide and lower in oxygen.
Aggregate, soil. Many fine particles held in a single mass or cluster. Natural soil
aggregates, such as granules, blocks, or prisms, are called peds. Clods are
aggregates produced by tillage or logging.
Alluvial fan. A low, outspread mass of loose materials and/or rock material, commonly
with gentle slopes. It is shaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone. The
material was deposited by a stream at the place where it issues from a narrow
mountain valley or upland valley or where a tributary stream is near or at its
junction with the main stream. The fan is steepest near its apex, which points
upstream, and slopes gently and convexly outward (downstream) with a gradual
decrease in gradient.
Alluvium. Unconsolidated material, such as gravel, sand, silt, clay, and various
mixtures of these, deposited on land by running water.
Alpha,alpha-dipyridyl. A compound that when dissolved in ammonium acetate is
used to detect the presence of reduced iron (Fe II) in the soil. A positive reaction
implies reducing conditions and the likely presence of redoximorphic features.
Animal unit month (AUM). The amount of forage required by one mature cow of
approximately 1,000 pounds weight, with or without a calf, for 1 month.
Aquic conditions. Current soil wetness characterized by saturation, reduction, and
redoximorphic features.
Argillic horizon. A subsoil horizon characterized by an accumulation of illuvial clay.
Aspect. The direction toward which a slope faces. Also called slope aspect.
Available water capacity (available moisture capacity). The capacity of soils to hold
water available for use by most plants. It is commonly defined as the difference
between the amount of soil water at field moisture capacity and the amount at
wilting point. It is commonly expressed as inches of water per inch of soil. The
capacity, in inches, in a 60-inch profile or to a limiting layer is expressed as:
Very low..............................................................0 to 3
Low......................................................................3 to 6
Moderate.............................................................6 to 9
High...................................................................9 to 12
Very high................................................more than 12
