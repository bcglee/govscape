Kernan Series
Taxonomic classification: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aeric Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs
Taxadjunct features: The Kernan soils in this survey area have less expansive clay
than is defined as the range for the series. This difference, however, does not
significantly affect the use and management of the soils. These soils are classified
as fine, smectitic, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs.
