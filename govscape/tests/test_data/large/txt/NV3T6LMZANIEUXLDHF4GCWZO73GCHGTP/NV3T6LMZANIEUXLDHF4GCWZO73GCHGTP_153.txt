in the cropping sequence helps to control erosion in the more sloping areas. It also
provides nitrogen and improves tilth for the subsequent crop.
Terraces reduce the hazard of erosion by shortening the slopes and by controlling
runoff. If a tile outlet terrace is used, the water that collects behind the terrace is
removed by tile at a slow, controlled rate.
Grassed waterways reduce the hazard of erosion by providing a stable channel for
water runoff on sloping land (fig. 13).
Conservation buffer strips and riparian areas can help to maintain stream channels
and control runoff. A stream channel without trees is susceptible to slumping, but a
protected riparian area can help to maintain the stream channel (fig. 14).
Contour farming involves conducting tillage or other fieldwork along the contour of a
slope rather than perpendicular to it. This practice helps to control erosion because it
