140 Soil Survey of
Low pH is a limitation if the pH within a depth of 40 inches is less than or equal to
5.5. This limitation can create toxicity or reduce the availability of nutrients, thus
reducing the health and vigor of plants. Many soils in Douglas County have pH less
than or equal to 5.5 within a depth of 40 inches. Starks, Sexton, and Birkbeck soils are
examples.
Selecting adapted forage and hay varieties and applying lime according to the
results of soil tests can help to overcome low pH. Some species, such as red clover or
alsike clover, are more tolerant of acidic conditions and can improve the quantity and
quality of livestock forage.
Ponding is a limitation if the upper limit of the seasonal high water table is above the
soil surface. Ponding affects aeration and increases nutrient losses. Some soils
affected by ponding in the survey area are Drummer, Harpster, Hartsburg, Milford,
Peotone, and Sawmill soils.
Land grading helps to control ponding. Surface ditches and surface inlet tile also
help to remove excess water if suitable outlets are available. Management of drainage
in conformity with wetland regulations may require special permits and extra planning.
Selecting forage and hay varieties adapted to wet conditions can improve forage
production. Restricted use during wet periods helps to keep the pasture in good
condition.
Poor tilth is a limitation if (1) the content of clay in the surface layer is at least 27
percent but less than 35 percent and the content of organic matter is less than 4
percent, or (2) the content of clay is greater than or equal to 35 percent. Poor tilth can
occur in soils when part of the subsoil is incorporated into the plow layer, typically as a
result of the thinning of the surface layer by erosion. The incorporation of subsoil
material into the plow layer reduces the content of organic matter and increases the
clay content in the surface soil. Poor tilth also occurs in poorly drained soils that have a
high content of clay, regardless of organic matter content, and in soils that have been
excessively tilled. Soils with poor tilth generally have a surface layer that is sticky when
wet and hard and cloddy when dry. Because they can be tilled only within a narrow
range of moisture content, seedbed preparation is difficult. Poor tilth inhibits seedling
germination and emergence, increases runoff and erosion, and reduces the rate of
water infiltration. Clods make it difficult to prepare a good seedbed. Sloping fields
commonly have clayey spots where the subsoil is exposed. Preparing a good seedbed
and tilling are difficult in these areas because the original friable surface layer has
been lost through erosion.
Soils with good tilth are granular and porous and have a high content of organic
matter in the surface layer. Dana, Flanagan, and Catlin soils commonly have good tilth.
Soils that have poor tilth generally have more clay, a lower content of organic matter,
and weaker soil structure in the surface layer. Milford, Peotone, and Zook soils have
poor tilth. If these soils are plowed when too wet, they become cloddy.
Practices that improve tilth protect the surface from the impact of raindrops and
flowing water. Incorporating green manure crops, manure, or crop residue into the soil
and using a system of conservation tillage can improve tilth. Regularly returning crop
residue to the soil, adding other organic material to the soil, minimizing tillage, and
timing conservation tillage operations to near optimal soil moisture conditions also
improve tilth. Surface cloddiness can be controlled by avoiding tillage when the soil is
too wet or by using no-till methods.
A root-restrictive layer is a limitation if dense material, a natric horizon, bedrock, or
a fragipan is within 40 inches of the surface. A root-restrictive layer can increase the
susceptibility of the soil to erosion and can limit the effectiveness of drainage systems.
Root-restrictive layers affect plant growth by limiting nutrients and available water.
Examples of soils with root-restrictive layers are Mona and Octagon soils.
