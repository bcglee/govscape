In an area sanitary landfill, solid waste is placed in successive layers on the surface
of the soil. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil
from a source away from the site. A final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is
placed over the completed landfill. The ratings in the table are based on the soil
properties that affect trafficability and the risk of pollution. These properties include
flooding, permeability, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, and depth to bedrock or
a cemented pan.
Flooding is a serious problem because it can result in pollution in areas
downstream from the landfill. If permeability is too rapid or if fractured bedrock, a
fractured cemented pan, or the water table is close to the surface, the leachate can
contaminate the water supply. Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading
required to maintain roads in the steeper areas of the landfill. Also, leachate may flow
along the surface of the soils in the steeper areas and cause difficult seepage
problems.
Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is used to cover compacted solid
waste in an area sanitary landfill. The soil material is obtained offsite, transported to
the landfill, and spread over the waste. The ratings in the table also apply to the final
cover for a landfill. They are based on the soil properties that affect workability, the
ease of digging, and the ease of moving and spreading the material over the refuse
daily during wet and dry periods. These properties include soil texture, depth to a
water table, ponding, rock fragments, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan,
reaction, and content of salts, sodium, or lime.
Loamy or silty soils that are free of large stones and excess gravel are the best
cover for a landfill. Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread; sandy soils are
subject to wind erosion.
Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material. Also, it can
influence runoff, erosion, and reclamation of the borrow area.
After soil material has been removed, the soil material remaining in the borrow area
must be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table to permit
revegetation. The soil material used as the final cover for a landfill should be suitable
for plants. It should not have excess sodium, salts, or lime and should not be too acid.
Construction Materials
Tables 16a and 16b give information about the soils as potential sources of
reclamation material, roadfill, topsoil, gravel, and sand. Normal compaction, minor
processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.
In table 16a, the soils are rated good, fair, or poor as potential sources of roadfill,
reclamation material, and topsoil. The features that limit the soils as sources of these
materials are specified in the table. The numerical ratings given after the specified
features indicate the degree to which the features limit the soils as sources of roadfill,
reclamation material, or topsoil. The lower the number, the greater the limitation.
Reclamation material is used in areas that have been drastically disturbed by
surface mining or similar activities. When these areas are reclaimed, layers of soil
material or unconsolidated geological material, or both, are replaced in a vertical
sequence. The reconstructed soil favors plant growth. The ratings in the table do not
apply to quarries and other mined areas that require an offsite source of
reconstruction material. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect erosion
and stability of the surface and the productive potential of the reconstructed soil. These
properties include the content of sodium, salts, and calcium carbonate; reaction;
available water capacity; erodibility; texture; content of rock fragments; and content of
organic matter and other features that affect fertility.
Roadfill is soil material that is excavated in one place and used in road
embankments in another place. In this table, the soils are rated as a source of roadfill
