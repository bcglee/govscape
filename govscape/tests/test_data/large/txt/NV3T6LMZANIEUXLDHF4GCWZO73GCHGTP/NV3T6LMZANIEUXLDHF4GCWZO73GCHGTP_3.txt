National Cooperative Soil Survey
This soil survey is a publication of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, a joint effort
of the United States Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies, State
agencies including the Agricultural Experiment Stations, and local agencies. The Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has leadership for the Federal part of the
National Cooperative Soil Survey. This survey was made cooperatively by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station. The
survey is part of the technical assistance furnished to the Douglas County Soil and
Water Conservation District. Financial assistance was provided by Douglas County and
the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Major fieldwork for this survey was completed in 1966. Soil names and descriptions
for the update survey were approved in 2003. Unless otherwise indicated, statements in
this publication refer to conditions in the survey area in 2004. The most current
information is available through the NRCS Soil Data Mart Web site or the NRCS Web
Soil Survey. The Soil Data Mart is the data storage site for the official soil survey
information.
Soil maps in this survey may be copied without permission. Original soil survey maps
were prepared at publication scale. Viewing scale and printing scale, however, may vary
from the original. The bar scale on each map sheet indicates the proper map
measurements.
