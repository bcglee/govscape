refinement, the suitability of a soil as subgrade material can be indicated by a group
index number. Group index numbers range from 0 for the best subgrade material to 20
or higher for the poorest.
Rock fragments larger than 10 inches in diameter and 3 to 10 inches in diameter
are indicated as a percentage of the total soil on a dry-weight basis. The percentages
are estimates determined mainly by converting volume percentage in the field to
weight percentage.
Percentage (of soil particles) passing designated sieves is the percentage of the
soil fraction less than 3 inches in diameter based on an ovendry weight. The sieves,
numbers 4, 10, 40, and 200 (USA Standard Series), have openings of 4.76, 2.00,
0.420, and 0.074 millimeters, respectively. Estimates are based on laboratory tests of
soils sampled in the survey area and in nearby areas and on estimates made in the
field.
Liquid limit and plasticity index (Atterberg limits) indicate the plasticity
characteristics of a soil. The estimates are based on test data from the survey area or
from nearby areas and on field examination.
The estimates of particle-size distribution, liquid limit, and plasticity index are
generally rounded to the nearest 5 percent. Thus, if the ranges of gradation and
Atterberg limits extend a marginal amount (1 or 2 percentage points) across
classification boundaries, the classification in the marginal zone is generally omitted in
the table.
Physical Properties
Table 19 shows estimates of some physical characteristics and features that affect
soil behavior. These estimates are given for the layers of each soil in the survey area.
The estimates are based on field observations and on test data for these and similar
soils.
