Douglas County, Illinois 191
runoff. Water that enters the soil before reaching surface streams is called ground-
water runoff or seepage flow from ground water.
Saline soil. A soil containing soluble salts in an amount that impairs growth of plants.
A saline soil does not contain excess exchangeable sodium.
Sand. As a soil separate, individual rock or mineral fragments from 0.05 millimeter to
2.0 millimeters in diameter. Most sand grains consist of quartz. As a soil textural
class, a soil that is 85 percent or more sand and not more than 10 percent clay.
Sandstone. Sedimentary rock containing dominantly sand-sized particles.
Sangamonian (geology). In Illinois, represents an interglacial age between the
Illinoian and Wisconsinan glacial stages during the Pleistocene. See Pleistocene;
Geosol.
Sapric soil material (muck). The most highly decomposed of all organic soil material.
Muck has the least amount of plant fiber, the highest bulk density, and the lowest
water content at saturation of all organic soil material.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K ). See Permeability.
sat
Saturation. Wetness characterized by zero or positive pressure of the soil water.
Under conditions of saturation, the water will flow from the soil matrix into an
unlined auger hole.
Scarification. The act of abrading, scratching, loosening, crushing, or modifying the
surface to increase water absorption or to provide a more tillable soil.
Second bottom. The first terrace above the normal flood plain (or first bottom) of a
river.
Sedimentary rock. A consolidated deposit of clastic particles, chemical precipitates,
or organic remains accumulated at or near the surface of the earth under normal
low temperature and pressure conditions. Sedimentary rocks include consolidated
equivalents of alluvium, colluvium, drift, and eolian, lacustrine, and marine
deposits. Examples are sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, claystone, shale,
conglomerate, limestone, dolomite, and coal.
Sequum. A sequence consisting of an illuvial horizon and the overlying eluvial horizon.
(See Eluviation.)
Series, soil. A group of soils that have profiles that are almost alike, except for
differences in texture of the surface layer. All the soils of a series have horizons
that are similar in composition, thickness, and arrangement.
Shale. Sedimentary rock that formed by the hardening of a deposit of clay, silty clay, or
silty clay loam and that has a tendency to split into thin layers.
Sheet erosion. The removal of a fairly uniform layer of soil material from the land
surface by the action of rainfall and surface runoff.
Shoulder. The convex, erosional surface near the top of a hillslope. A shoulder is a
transition from summit to backslope.
Shrink-swell (in tables). The shrinking of soil when dry and the swelling when wet.
Shrinking and swelling can damage roads, dams, building foundations, and other
structures. It can also damage plant roots.
Side slope (geomorphology). A geomorphic component of hills consisting of a laterally
planar area of a hillside. The overland waterflow is predominantly parallel. Side
slopes are dominantly colluvium and slope-wash sediments.
Silica. A combination of silicon and oxygen. The mineral form is called quartz.
Silica-sesquioxide ratio. The ratio of the number of molecules of silica to the number
of molecules of alumina and iron oxide. The more highly weathered soils or their
clay fractions in warm-temperate, humid regions, and especially those in the
tropics, generally have a low ratio.
Silt. As a soil separate, individual mineral particles that range in diameter from the
upper limit of clay (0.002 millimeter) to the lower limit of very fine sand (0.05
millimeter). As a soil textural class, soil that is 80 percent or more silt and less than
12 percent clay.
