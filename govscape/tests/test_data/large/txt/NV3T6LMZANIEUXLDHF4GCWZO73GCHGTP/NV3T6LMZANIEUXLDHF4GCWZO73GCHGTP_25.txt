14 Soil Survey of
Micro-organisms, earthworms, insects, and burrowing animals have also affected
soil formation. Bacteria and fungi help to decompose plant and animal remains and
change them into humus. Burrowing animals, such as earthworms, cicadas, and
ground squirrels, help to incorporate humus into the soil while creating small channels
that influence soil aeration and the percolation of water. Humus is very important in the
formation of soil structure and good tilth.
Human activities, such as installing subsurface drains, building levees for flood
protection, construction, and the clearing of native forests, have significantly altered
the nature of the existing plant and animal communities. These activities have also
contributed to the loss of soil material and organic material through accelerated
erosion.
Relief
Relief, or local changes in elevation, has markedly affected the soils in Douglas
County by influencing runoff, erosion, deposition, and natural drainage. Relief includes
landform characteristics, such as position on the landform, slope gradient, slope
shape, and slope aspect.
Variations in relief in the county reflect a variety of landforms. The most extensive
landforms in the county are end moraines, ground moraines, stream terraces, lake
plains, and flood plains.
The presence of a series of end moraines in Douglas County represents
successive advances and retreats of the glacial ice front. The end moraines have
slopes that are quite variable, commonly ranging from gently sloping to very steep. The
Arcola Moraine occurs in the eastern and southern parts of the county, and the
Pesotum and West Ridge Moraines occur in the north. Dana, Octagon, and
Senachwine soils are examples of soils on end moraines in the county.
Ground moraines of the Wisconsinan Stage, which occur between the end
moraines, generally consist of broad, nearly level to gently sloping interfluves. The
relief on ground moraines is less variable than the relief on end moraines, and the
loess deposits are thicker. Catlin and Flanagan soils are examples of soils on ground
moraines.
Outwash stream terraces occur primarily along the Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers
and their tributaries. They are generally nearly level to gently sloping areas that lie
above adjacent flood plains. Camden, Martinsville, and Starks soils occur on stream
terraces in the county.
Where the parent material is relatively uniform, differences in natural drainage are
closely related to landform position, such as summit or backslope, and to slope
gradient and shape. Drummer and Camden soils, for example, both formed in loess
and in the underlying outwash. Drummer soils are on nearly level, commonly concave
toeslopes. Precipitation and runoff from the higher adjacent soils contribute to the
ponding of surface water on the poorly drained Drummer soils. The water in the
saturated soil pores restricts the circulation of air in the soil. Under these conditions,
naturally occurring iron and manganese compounds are chemically reduced. The
reduced form of iron appears gray, bluish, or gray-green and leaves the subsoil with a
low-chroma grayish color. Also, reduced forms of iron are more soluble than oxidized
forms and can be leached readily from the soil. In both cases, the subsoil appears
gray. Camden soils, conversely, are well drained and are on gently sloping summits
and convex backslopes. Because the water table is lower in Camden soils and some
of the rainfall runs off the sloping surface instead of infiltrating, the soil pores contain
less water and more air. In these conditions, iron and manganese compounds are well
oxidized, giving the subsoil a brownish to reddish color.
Relief also affects the susceptibility to and intensity of both geologic and recent
accelerated erosion. Soils on the steeper slopes or in areas where slopes are long are
