Local roads and streets have an all-weather surface and carry automobile and light
truck traffic all year. They have a subgrade of cut or fill soil material; a base of gravel,
crushed rock, or soil material stabilized by lime or cement; and a surface of flexible
material (asphalt), rigid material (concrete), or gravel with a binder. The ratings are
based on the soil properties that affect the ease of excavation and grading and the
traffic-supporting capacity. The properties that affect the ease of excavation and
grading are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented
pan, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.
The properties that affect the traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength (as inferred
from the AASHTO group index number), subsidence, linear extensibility (shrink-swell
potential), the potential for frost action, depth to a water table, and ponding.
Shallow excavations are trenches or holes dug to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet
for graves, utility lines, open ditches, or other purposes. The ratings are based on the
soil properties that influence the ease of digging and the resistance to sloughing.
Depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, the
amount of large stones, and dense layers influence the ease of digging, filling, and
compacting. Depth to the seasonal high water table, flooding, and ponding may restrict
the period when excavations can be made. Slope influences the ease of using
machinery. Soil texture, depth to the water table, and linear extensibility (shrink-swell
potential) influence the resistance to sloughing.
Lawns and landscaping require soils on which turf and ornamental trees and shrubs
can be established and maintained. Irrigation is not considered in the ratings. The
ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth and trafficability after
vegetation is established. The properties that affect plant growth are reaction; depth to
a water table; ponding; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; the available water
capacity in the upper 40 inches; the content of salts, sodium, or calcium carbonate;
and sulfidic materials. The properties that affect trafficability are flooding, depth to a
water table, ponding, slope, stoniness, and the amount of sand, clay, or organic matter
in the surface layer.
Sanitary Facilities
Tables 15a and 15b show the degree and kind of soil limitations that affect septic
tank absorption fields, sewage lagoons, sanitary landfills, and daily cover for landfill.
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to
which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. Not limited
indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good
performance and very low maintenance can be expected. Somewhat limited indicates
that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The
limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.
Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. Very limited indicates
that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The
limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special
design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance
can be expected.
Numerical ratings in the tables indicate the severity of individual limitations. The
ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate
gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact
on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).
Septic tank absorption fields are areas in which effluent from a septic tank is
distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. Only that part of the
soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is evaluated. The ratings are based on the
soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of
the system, and public health. Permeability, depth to a water table, ponding, depth to
