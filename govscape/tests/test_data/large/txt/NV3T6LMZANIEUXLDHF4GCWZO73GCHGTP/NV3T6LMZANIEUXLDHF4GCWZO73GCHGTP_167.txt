156 Soil Survey of
The information in the tables, along with the soil maps, the soil descriptions, and
other data provided in this survey, can be used to make additional interpretations.
Some of the terms used in this soil survey have a special meaning in soil science
and are defined in the Glossary.
Building Site Development
Soil properties influence the development of building sites, including the selection of
the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance after construction, and
maintenance. Tables 14a and 14b show the degree and kind of soil limitations that
affect dwellings with and without basements, small commercial buildings, local roads
and streets, shallow excavations, and lawns and landscaping.
The ratings in the tables are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate
the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect building
site development. Not limited indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable
for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.
Somewhat limited indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for
the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning,
design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.
Very limited indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for
the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil
reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance
and high maintenance can be expected.
Numerical ratings in the tables indicate the severity of individual limitations. The
ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate
gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact
on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).
Dwellings are single-family houses of three stories or less. For dwellings without
basements, the foundation is assumed to consist of spread footings of reinforced
concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of maximum frost
penetration, whichever is deeper. For dwellings with basements, the foundation is
assumed to consist of spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil
at a depth of about 7 feet. The ratings for dwellings are based on the soil properties
that affect the capacity of the soil to support a load without movement and on the
properties that affect excavation and construction costs. The properties that affect the
load-supporting capacity include depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, subsidence,
linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential), and compressibility. Compressibility is
inferred from the Unified classification. The properties that affect the ease and amount
of excavation include depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, slope, depth to bedrock
or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount and size
of rock fragments.
Small commercial buildings are structures that are less than three stories high and
do not have basements. The foundation is assumed to consist of spread footings of
reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of
maximum frost penetration, whichever is deeper. The ratings are based on the soil
properties that affect the capacity of the soil to support a load without movement and
on the properties that affect excavation and construction costs. The properties that
affect the load-supporting capacity include depth to a water table, ponding, flooding,
subsidence, linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential), and compressibility (which is
inferred from the Unified classification). The properties that affect the ease and amount
of excavation include flooding, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, depth to bedrock
or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount and size
of rock fragments.
