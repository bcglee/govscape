General Description
(cid:127) This map unit is in areas where soil material has been excavated and redeposited
during sand and gravel mining operations, road construction, dam building, or other
activities requiring mass disturbance of earthy material. Typically, the surface layer is
clay loam about 10 inches thick. The underlying material to a depth of 60 inches or
more is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.
Setting
Landform: Ground moraines or stream terraces
Position on the landform: Backslopes
