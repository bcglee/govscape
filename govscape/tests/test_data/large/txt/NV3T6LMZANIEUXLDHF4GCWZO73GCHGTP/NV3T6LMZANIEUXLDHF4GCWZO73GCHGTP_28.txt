Soil Series and Detailed Soil Map
Units
In this section, arranged in alphabetical order, each soil series recognized in the
survey area is described. Each series description is followed by descriptions of the
associated detailed soil map units.
Characteristics of the soil and the material in which it formed are identified for each
soil series. A pedon, a small three-dimensional area of soil, that is typical of the series
in the survey area is described. The detailed description of each soil horizon follows
standards in the “Soil Survey Manual” (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). Many of the
technical terms used in the descriptions are defined in “Soil Taxonomy” (Soil Survey
Staff, 1999) and in “Keys to Soil Taxonomy” (Soil Survey Staff, 1998). Unless otherwise
stated, colors in the descriptions are for moist soil. Following the pedon description is
the range of important characteristics of the soils in the series.
In some instances, the typical pedon for the series is located outside Douglas
County. The selection of the typical pedon is based on the range in characteristics of
the series as it occurs throughout a particular major land resource area (MLRA). The
Drummer series is a common soil in MLRA 108. The typical pedon for the Drummer
series is in Champaign County, Illinois. The soil properties of this pedon are
representative of the Drummer soils not only in Champaign County but in other
counties within MLRA 108, including Douglas County.
The map units on the detailed soil maps in this survey represent the soils or
miscellaneous areas in the survey area. The map unit descriptions in this section,
along with the maps, can be used to determine the suitability and potential of a unit for
specific uses. They also can be used to plan the management needed for those uses.
More information about each map unit is given under the headings “Use and
Management of the Soils” and “Soil Properties.”
A map unit delineation on a soil map represents an area dominated by one or more
major kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas. A map unit is identified and named
according to the taxonomic classification of the dominant soils. Within a taxonomic
class there are precisely defined limits for the properties of the soils. On the
landscape, however, the soils are natural phenomena, and they have the characteristic
variability of all natural phenomena. Thus, the range of some observed properties may
extend beyond the limits defined for a taxonomic class. Areas of soils of a single
taxonomic class rarely, if ever, can be mapped without including areas of other
taxonomic classes. Consequently, every map unit is made up of the soils or
miscellaneous areas for which it is named and some minor components that belong to
taxonomic classes other than those of the major soils.
Most minor soils have properties similar to those of the dominant soil or soils in the
map unit, and thus they do not affect use and management. These are called
noncontrasting, or similar, components. They may or may not be mentioned in a
particular map unit description. Other minor components, however, have properties
and behavioral characteristics divergent enough to affect use or to require different
management. These are called contrasting, or dissimilar, components. They generally
are in small areas and could not be mapped separately because of the scale used.
Some small areas of strongly contrasting soils or miscellaneous areas are identified by
a special symbol on the maps. The contrasting components are mentioned in the map
unit descriptions. A few areas of minor components may not have been observed, and
