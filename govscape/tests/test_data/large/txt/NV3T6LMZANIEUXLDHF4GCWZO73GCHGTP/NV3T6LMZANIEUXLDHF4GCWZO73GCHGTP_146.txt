overcome by incorporating green manure crops, manure, or crop residue into the soil;
applying a system of conservation tillage; and using conservation cropping systems.
Also, crops may respond well to additions of phosphate fertilizer.
Flooding applies to any map unit that is subject to common, occasional, frequent, or
very frequent flooding. Flooding occurs on approximately 8,133 acres in the county, or
about 3 percent of the total acreage. It usually occurs in unprotected areas along
major rivers and their tributaries. Dikes or diversions reduce the extent of crop damage
caused by floodwater. In frequently flooded areas, flooding is likely to occur under
normal weather conditions; there is more than a 50 percent chance of flooding in any
given year, and flooding will likely occur more than 50 times in 100 years. Some soils
in Douglas County are subject to occasional flooding. These soils, under normal
weather conditions, are expected to have a 5 to 50 percent chance of flooding in any
year; 5 to 50 flooding events are expected in 100 years. Flooding typically occurs in
winter and spring. Damage to crops, particularly winter small grain crops, occurs in
some years (fig. 10).
Some Sawmill, Shaffton, and Zook soils are subject to frequent flooding for brief
periods. The poorly drained Sawmill soils are frequently flooded for long periods in
some areas. The moderately well drained Medway soils are on flood-plain terraces and
are subject to occasional flooding for brief periods.
Flood-prone soils are better suited to crop varieties that require a relatively short
growing season. Planting crops that are adapted to a shorter growing season and
wetter conditions reduces the risk of crop damage caused by floodwater. Reducing
runoff from higher ground within the watershed can reduce the frequency and severity
of flooding. Changing land use from cropland to pasture or forestland can also
minimize economic damage.
High pH is a limitation if the pH in the upper 40 inches of the soil is greater than or
equal to 7.4. This limitation can create plant toxicity or reduce the availability of plant
nutrients. Many soils in Douglas County have pH above 7.4 within a depth of 40
inches. Harpster, Hartsburg, Senachwine, and Octagon soils have high pH.
Limited available water capacity occurs when the available water capacity in the
upper 60 inches of the soil is less than 6 inches. This limitation defines the potential
droughtiness of a soil. Mona soils are examples of soils that are subject to this
limitation.
Low pH is a limitation if the pH within a depth of 40 inches is less than 4.5. This
limitation can create toxicity or reduce the availability of nutrients, thus reducing the

damage in areas of Sawmill soils.
