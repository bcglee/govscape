178 Soil Survey of
Complex, soil. A map unit of two or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous areas in such
an intricate pattern or so small in area that it is not practical to map them
separately at the selected scale of mapping. The pattern and proportion of the
soils or miscellaneous areas are somewhat similar in all areas.
Concretions. See Redoximorphic features.
Conglomerate. A coarse grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of rounded or
subangular rock fragments more than 2 millimeters in diameter. It commonly has a
matrix of sand and finer textured material. Conglomerate is the consolidated
equivalent of gravel.
Conservation cropping system. Growing crops in combination with needed cultural
and management practices. In a good conservation cropping system, the soil-
improving crops and practices more than offset the effects of the soil-depleting
crops and practices. Cropping systems are needed on all tilled soils. Soil-
improving practices in a conservation cropping system include the use of rotations
that contain grasses and legumes and the return of crop residue to the soil. Other
practices include the use of green manure crops of grasses and legumes, proper
tillage, adequate fertilization, and weed and pest control.
Conservation tillage. A tillage system that does not invert the soil and that leaves a
protective amount of crop residue on the surface throughout the year.
Consistence, soil. Refers to the degree of cohesion and adhesion of soil material and
its resistance to deformation when ruptured. Consistence includes resistance of
soil material to rupture and to penetration; plasticity, toughness, and stickiness of
puddled soil material; and the manner in which the soil material behaves when
subject to compression. Terms describing consistence are defined in the “Soil
Survey Manual.”
Contour stripcropping. Growing crops in strips that follow the contour. Strips of grass
or close-growing crops are alternated with strips of clean-tilled crops or summer
fallow.
Control section. The part of the soil on which classification is based. The thickness
varies among different kinds of soil, but for many it is that part of the soil profile
between depths of 10 inches and 40 or 80 inches.
Coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat). A type of limnic layer composed
predominantly of fecal material derived from aquatic animals.
Corrosion (geomorphology). A process of erosion whereby rocks and soil are
removed or worn away by natural chemical processes, especially by the solvent
action of running water, but also by other reactions, such as hydrolysis, hydration,
carbonation, and oxidation.
Corrosion (soil survey interpretations). Soil-induced electrochemical or chemical
action that dissolves or weakens concrete or uncoated steel.
Cover crop. A close-growing crop grown primarily to improve and protect the soil
between periods of regular crop production, or a crop grown between trees and
vines in orchards and vineyards.
Crop residue management. Returning crop residue to the soil, which helps to
maintain soil structure, organic matter content, and fertility and helps to control
erosion.
Cropping system. Growing crops according to a planned system of rotation and
management practices.
Cross-slope farming. Deliberately conducting farming operations on sloping farmland
in such a way that tillage is across the general slope.
Crown. The upper part of a tree or shrub, including the living branches and their
foliage.
Culmination of the mean annual increment (CMAI). The average annual increase
per acre in the volume of a stand. Computed by dividing the total volume of the
stand by its age. As the stand increases in age, the mean annual increment
