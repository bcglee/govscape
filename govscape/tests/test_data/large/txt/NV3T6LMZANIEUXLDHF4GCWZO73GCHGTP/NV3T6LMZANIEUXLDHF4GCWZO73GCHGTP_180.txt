Potential for frost action is the likelihood of upward or lateral expansion of the soil
caused by the formation of segregated ice lenses (frost heave) and the subsequent
collapse of the soil and loss of strength on thawing. Frost action occurs when moisture
moves into the freezing zone of the soil. Temperature, texture, density, permeability,
content of organic matter, and depth to the water table are the most important factors
considered in evaluating the potential for frost action. It is assumed that the soil is not
insulated by vegetation or snow and is not artificially drained. Silty and highly
structured, clayey soils that have a high water table in winter are the most susceptible
to frost action. Well drained, very gravelly, or very sandy soils are the least susceptible.
Frost heave and low soil strength during thawing cause damage to pavements and
other rigid structures.
Risk of corrosion pertains to potential soil-induced electrochemical or chemical
action that corrodes or weakens uncoated steel or concrete. The rate of corrosion of
uncoated steel is related to such factors as soil moisture, particle-size distribution,
acidity, and electrical conductivity of the soil. The rate of corrosion of concrete is based
mainly on the sulfate and sodium content, texture, moisture content, and acidity of the
soil. Special site examination and design may be needed if the combination of factors
results in a severe hazard of corrosion. The steel or concrete in installations that
intersect soil boundaries or soil layers is more susceptible to corrosion than the steel
or concrete in installations that are entirely within one kind of soil or within one soil
layer.
For uncoated steel, the risk of corrosion, expressed as low, moderate, or high, is
based on soil drainage class, total acidity, electrical resistivity near field capacity, and
electrical conductivity of the saturation extract.
For concrete, the risk of corrosion also is expressed as low, moderate, or high. It is
based on soil texture, acidity, and amount of sulfates in the saturation extract.
Engineering Index Test Data
Table 23 shows laboratory test data for one pedon sampled at a carefully selected
site in the survey area. The pedon is representative of the series as it occurs in MLRA
108. The soil samples were tested by the Illinois Department of Transportation.
The testing methods generally are those of the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) or the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM).
The tests and methods are Moisture density—T 99 (AASHTO), D 698 (ASTM);
Mechanical analysis—T 88 (AASHTO), D 422 (ASTM), D 2217 (ASTM); Liquid limit—T
89 (AASHTO), D 4318 (ASTM); Plasticity index—T 90 (AASHTO), D 4318 (ASTM);
AASHTO classification—M 145 (AASHTO), D 3282 (ASTM); and Unified
classification—D 2487-00 (ASTM).
