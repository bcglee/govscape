Prime Farmland
Prime farmland is one of several kinds of important farmland defined by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. It is of major importance in meeting the Nation’s short- and
long-range needs for food and fiber. Because the supply of high-quality farmland is
limited, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recognizes that responsible levels of
government, as well as individuals, should encourage and facilitate the wise use of our
Nation’s prime farmland.
Prime farmland, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is land that has
the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed,
forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is available for these uses. It could be cultivated
land, pastureland, forestland, or other land, but it is not urban or built-up land or water
areas. The soil qualities, growing season, and moisture supply are those needed for
the soil to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when proper
management, including water management, and acceptable farming methods are
applied. In general, prime farmland has an adequate and dependable supply of
moisture from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season,
acceptable acidity or alkalinity, an acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no
rocks. It is permeable to water and air. It is not excessively erodible or saturated with
water for long periods, and it either is not frequently flooded during the growing season
or is protected from flooding. Slope ranges mainly from 0 to 6 percent. More detailed
information about the criteria for prime farmland is available at the local office of the
Natural Resources Conservation Service.
About 251,947 acres in the survey area, or nearly 94 percent of the total acreage,
meets the soil requirements for prime farmland. This land generally is used for
cultivated crops, mainly corn and soybeans.
A recent trend in land use in some parts of the survey area has been the loss of
some prime farmland to industrial and urban uses. The loss of prime farmland to other
uses puts pressure on marginal lands, which generally are more erodible, droughty,
and less productive and cannot be easily cultivated.
The map units in the survey area that are considered prime farmland are listed in
table 8. This list does not constitute a recommendation for a particular land use. On
some soils included in the list, measures that overcome a hazard or limitation, such as
flooding, wetness, and droughtiness, are needed. Onsite evaluation is needed to
determine whether or not the hazard or limitation has been overcome by corrective
measures. The extent of each listed map unit is shown in table 5. The location is
shown on the detailed soil maps. The soil qualities that affect use and management
are described under the heading “Soil Series and Detailed Soil Map Units.”
Hydric Soils
Table 9 lists the map unit components in the survey area that are considered hydric
soils. This list can help in planning land uses; however, onsite investigation is
recommended to determine the hydric soils on a specific site (National Research
Council, 1995; Hurt and others, 2002).
The three essential characteristics of wetlands are hydrophytic vegetation, hydric
soils, and wetland hydrology (Cowardin and others, 1979; U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, 1987; National Research Council, 1995; Tiner, 1985). Criteria for all of the
characteristics must be met for areas to be identified as wetlands. Undrained hydric
soils that have natural vegetation should support a dominant population of ecological
wetland plant species. Hydric soils that have been converted to other uses should be
capable of being restored to wetlands.
