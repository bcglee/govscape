SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are
intergrades or extragrades. The typic is the central concept of the great group; it is not
necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders,
or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the
great group but do not indicate transitions to any other known kind of soil. Each
subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great
group. An example is Aquic Argiudolls.
FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and
chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the
properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological
activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class,
mineral content, cation-exchange capacity, temperature regime, thickness of the root
zone, consistence, moisture equivalent, slope, and permanent cracks. A family name
consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An
example is fine, smectitic, mesic Aquic Argiudolls.
SERIES. The series consists of soils that have similar horizons in their profile. The
horizons are similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and
chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile. The texture of the surface layer
or of the substratum can differ within a series. The Flanagan series is an example.
