180 Soil Survey of
Duff. A generally firm organic layer on the surface of mineral soils. It consists of fallen
plant material that is in the process of decomposition and includes everything from
the litter on the surface to underlying pure humus.
Earthy fill. See Mine spoil.
Ecological site. An area where climate, soil, and relief are sufficiently uniform to
produce a distinct natural plant community. An ecological site is the product of all
the environmental factors responsible for its development. It is typified by an
association of species that differ from those on other ecological sites in kind and/
or proportion of species or in total production.
Eluviation. The movement of material in true solution or colloidal suspension from one
place to another within the soil. Soil horizons that have lost material through
eluviation are eluvial; those that have received material are illuvial.
End moraine. A ridgelike accumulation that is being or was produced at the outer
margin of an actively flowing glacier at any given time.
Endosaturation. A type of saturation of the soil in which all horizons between the
upper boundary of saturation and a depth of 2 meters are saturated.
Eolian deposit. Sand-, silt-, or clay-sized clastic material transported and deposited
primarily by wind, commonly in the form of a dune or a sheet of sand or loess.
Ephemeral stream. A stream, or reach of a stream, that flows only in direct response
to precipitation. It receives no long-continued supply from melting snow or other
source, and its channel is above the water table at all times.
Episaturation. A type of saturation indicating a perched water table in a soil in which
saturated layers are underlain by one or more unsaturated layers within 2 meters
of the surface.
Equality Formation (geology). Consists of gray to red silt and clay; generally shows
evidence of bedding structures and occurs above the Sangamon geosol.
Predominantly occurs as a fine grained lacustrine sediment. Ranges in age from
26,000 radiocarbon years to present.
Erosion. The wearing away of the land surface by water, wind, ice, or other geologic
agents and by such processes as gravitational creep.
Erosion (geologic). Erosion caused by geologic processes acting over long
geologic periods and resulting in the wearing away of mountains and the building
up of such landscape features as flood plains and coastal plains. Synonym: natural
erosion.
Erosion (accelerated). Erosion much more rapid than geologic erosion, mainly as
a result of human or animal activities or of a catastrophe in nature, such as a fire,
that exposes the surface.
Erosion surface. A land surface shaped by the action of erosion, especially by
running water.
Escarpment. A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff breaking the general
continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces and resulting from erosion or
faulting. Most commonly applied to cliffs produced by differential erosion.
Synonym: scarp.
Esker. A long, narrow, sinuous, steep-sided ridge of stratified sand and gravel
deposited as the bed of a stream flowing in an ice tunnel within or below the ice
(subglacial) or between ice walls on top of the ice of a wasting glacier and left
behind as high ground when the ice melted. Eskers range in length from less than
a kilometer to more than 160 kilometers and in height from 3 to 30 meters.
Fairgrange Till Member (geology). Abandoned nomenclature. Pink, reddish brown,
and brownish gray sandy till in east-central Illinois. See Delavan Member.
Fallow. Cropland left idle in order to restore productivity through accumulation of
moisture. Summer fallow is common in regions of limited rainfall where cereal
grain is grown. The soil is tilled for at least one growing season for weed control
and decomposition of plant residue.
