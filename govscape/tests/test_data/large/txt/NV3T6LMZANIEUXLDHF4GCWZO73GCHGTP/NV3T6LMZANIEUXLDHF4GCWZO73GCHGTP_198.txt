Douglas County, Illinois 187
Muck. Dark, finely divided, well decomposed organic soil material. (See Sapric soil
material.)
Munsell notation. A designation of color by degrees of three simple variables—hue,
value, and chroma. For example, a notation of 10YR 6/4 is a color with hue of
10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 4.
Natric horizon. A special kind of argillic horizon that contains enough exchangeable
sodium to have an adverse effect on the physical condition of the subsoil.
Neutral soil. A soil having a pH value of 6.6 to 7.3. (See Reaction, soil.)
Nodules. See Redoximorphic features.
Nose slope (geomorphology). A geomorphic component of hills consisting of the
projecting end (laterally convex area) of a hillside. The overland waterflow is
predominantly divergent. Nose slopes consist dominantly of colluvium and slope-
wash sediments (for example, slope alluvium).
Nutrient, plant. Any element taken in by a plant essential to its growth. Plant nutrients
are mainly nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron,
manganese, copper, boron, and zinc obtained from the soil and carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen obtained from the air and water.
Organic matter. Plant and animal residue in the soil in various stages of
decomposition. The content of organic matter in the surface layer is described as
follows:
Very low....................................less than 0.5 percent
Low..................................................0.5 to 1.0 percent
Moderately low...............................1.0 to 2.0 percent
Moderate.........................................2.0 to 4.0 percent
High.................................................4.0 to 8.0 percent
Very high................................. more than 8.0 percent
Outwash. Stratified and sorted sediments (chiefly sand and gravel) removed or
“washed out” from a glacier by meltwater streams and deposited in front of or
beyond the end moraine or the margin of a glacier. The coarser material is
deposited nearer to the ice.
Outwash plain. An extensive lowland area of coarse textured glaciofluvial material. An
outwash plain is commonly smooth; where pitted, it generally is low in relief.
Paleosol. A general term used to describe a soil that formed on a landscape of the
past; it may be a buried soil, a relict soil, or an exhumed soil. See Geosol.
Paleoterrace. An erosional remnant of a terrace that retains the surface form and
alluvial deposits of its origin but was not emplaced by, and commonly does not
grade to, a present-day stream or drainage network.
Pan. A compact, dense layer in a soil that impedes the movement of water and the
growth of roots. For example, hardpan, fragipan, claypan, plowpan, and traffic pan.
Parent material. The unconsolidated organic and mineral material in which soil forms.
Parkland facies (geology). An informal separation of the Henry Formation as dunes
in outwash areas; an informal separation of Peoria Silt if interfingered with silt in
bluff areas. Consists of well sorted eolian sand deposits in the form of dunes or
sheetlike deposits.
Peat. Unconsolidated material, largely undecomposed organic matter, that has
accumulated under excess moisture. (See Fibric soil material.)
Ped. An individual natural soil aggregate, such as a granule, a prism, or a block.
Pedisediment. A layer of sediment, eroded from the shoulder and backslope of an
erosional slope, that lies on and is being (or was) transported across a gently
sloping erosional surface at the foot of a receding hill or mountain slope.
Pedon. The smallest volume that can be called “a soil.” A pedon is three dimensional
and large enough to permit study of all horizons. Its area ranges from about 10 to
