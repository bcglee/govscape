continues to increase until mortality begins to reduce the rate of increase. The
point where the stand reaches its maximum annual rate of growth is called the
culmination of the mean annual increment.
Cutbanks cave (in tables). The walls of excavations tend to cave in or slough.
Deferred grazing. Postponing grazing or resting grazing land for a prescribed period.
Delavan Member (geology). Calcareous, brown gray to pink or violet gray loam
diamicton. The lower part of the Tiskilwa Formation, deposited between 26,000
and 18,500 radiocarbon years ago. Reclassified to include what was formerly
called the Fairgrange Till Member.
Delta. A body of alluvium having a surface that is fan shaped and nearly flat; deposited
at or near the mouth of a river or stream where it enters a body of relatively quiet
water, generally a sea or lake.
Dense layer (in tables). A very firm, massive layer that has a bulk density of more than
1.8 grams per cubic centimeter. Such a layer affects the ease of digging and can
affect filling and compacting.
Depth, soil. Generally, the thickness of the soil over bedrock. Very deep soils are more
than 60 inches deep over bedrock; deep soils, 40 to 60 inches; moderately deep,
20 to 40 inches; shallow, 10 to 20 inches; and very shallow, less than 10 inches.
Diamicton (geology). A general term for a till-like mixture of unsorted, unstratified
rock debris composed of a wide range of particle sizes; use of this term carries no
suggestion about how such debris was formed or deposited.
Diversion (or diversion terrace). A ridge of earth, generally a terrace, built to protect
downslope areas by diverting runoff from its natural course.
Divided-slope farming. A form of field stripcropping in which crops are grown in a
systematic arrangement of two strips, or bands, across the slope to reduce the
hazard of water erosion. One strip is in a close-growing crop that provides
protection from erosion, and the other strip is in a crop that provides less
protection from erosion. This practice is used where slopes are not long enough to
permit a full stripcropping pattern to be used.
Drainage class (natural). Refers to the frequency and duration of wet periods under
conditions similar to those under which the soil formed. Alterations of the water
regime by human activities, either through drainage or irrigation, are not a
consideration unless they have significantly changed the morphology of the soil.
Seven classes of natural soil drainage are recognized—excessively drained,
somewhat excessively drained, well drained, moderately well drained, somewhat
poorly drained, poorly drained, and very poorly drained. These classes are defined
in the “Soil Survey Manual.”
Drainage, surface. Runoff, or surface flow of water, from an area.
Drainageway. A general term for a course or channel along which water moves in
draining an area. A term restricted to relatively small, linear depressions that at
some time move concentrated water and either do not have a defined channel or
have only a small defined channel.
Drift. A general term applied to all mineral material (clay, silt, sand, gravel, and
boulders) transported by a glacier and deposited directly by or from the ice or
transported by running water emanating from a glacier. Drift includes unstratified
material (till) that forms moraines and stratified deposits that form outwash plains,
eskers, kames, varves, and glaciofluvial sediments. The term is generally applied
to Pleistocene glacial deposits in areas that no longer contain glaciers.
Drumlin. A low, smooth, elongated oval hill, mound, or ridge of compact till that has a
core of bedrock or drift. It commonly has a blunt nose facing the direction from
which the ice approached and a gentler slope tapering in the other direction. The
longer axis is parallel to the general direction of glacier flow. Drumlins are products
of streamline (laminar) flow of glaciers, which molded the subglacial floor through
a combination of erosion and deposition.
