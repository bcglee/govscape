150 Soil Survey of
ensure plant survival, a healthy planting stock of suitable species should be planted
properly on a well prepared site and maintained in good condition.
Table 11 shows the height that locally grown trees and shrubs are expected to
reach in 20 years on soils in the survey area. The estimates in the table are based on
measurements and observation of established plantings that have been given
adequate care. They can be used as a guide in planning windbreaks and screens.
Additional information on planning windbreaks and screens and planting and caring for
trees and shrubs can be obtained from the local office of the Natural Resources
Conservation Service or the Cooperative Extension Service or from a commercial
nursery.
Recreation
The demand for recreational facilities is increasing in Douglas County. The largest
recreation area is Walnut Point State Park north of Oakland. Small areas throughout
the county offer playgrounds, athletic fields, golf courses, fishing ponds, camping and
picnic areas, and hunting areas.
The potential for further recreational development is favorable throughout the
county. Soils that have the best potential for such development are in the uplands
along the Kaskaskia and Embarras Rivers. These soils are in areas where the hilly
terrain, wooded slopes, and numerous streams provide a variety of locations suited to
recreational uses.
The soils of the survey area are rated in tables 12a and 12b according to limitations
that affect their suitability for recreation. The ratings are both verbal and numerical.
Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil
features that affect the recreational uses. Not limited indicates that the soil has
features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low
maintenance can be expected. Somewhat limited indicates that the soil has features
that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or
minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate
maintenance can be expected. Very limited indicates that the soil has one or more
features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be
overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation
procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.
Numerical ratings in the tables indicate the severity of individual limitations. The
ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate
gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact
on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).
The ratings in the tables are based on restrictive soil features, such as wetness,
slope, and texture of the surface layer. Susceptibility to flooding is considered. Not
considered in the ratings, but important in evaluating a site, are the location and
accessibility of the area, the size and shape of the area and its scenic quality,
vegetation, access to water, potential water impoundment sites, and access to public
sewer lines. The capacity of the soil to absorb septic tank effluent and the ability of the
soil to support vegetation also are important. Soils that are subject to flooding are
limited for recreational uses by the duration and intensity of flooding and the season
when flooding occurs. In planning recreational facilities, onsite assessment of the
height, duration, intensity, and frequency of flooding is essential.
The information in the tables can be supplemented by other information in this
survey, for example, interpretations for building site development, construction
materials, sanitary facilities, and water management.
