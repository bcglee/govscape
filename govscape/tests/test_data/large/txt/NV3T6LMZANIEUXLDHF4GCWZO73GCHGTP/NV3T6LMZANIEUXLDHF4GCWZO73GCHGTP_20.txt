Formation and Classification of
the Soils
This section relates the soils in the survey area to the major factors of soil formation
and describes the system of soil classification.
Formation of the Soils
Soil is produced by soil-forming processes acting on materials deposited or
accumulated by geologic agencies. The characteristics of the soil are determined by
(1) the physical and mineralogical composition of the parent material; (2) the climate
under which the soil formed; (3) the plant and animal life on and in the soil; (4) the
relief, or lay of the land; and (5) the length of time the forces of soil formation have
acted on the parent material (Jenny, 1941).
Climate and plant and animal life are the active factors of soil formation. These
factors act directly on the parent material, either in place or after it has been relocated
by water, glaciers, or the wind, and slowly change it to a natural body that has
genetically related layers, or horizons. Relief can modify the effects of climate and
plant and animal life. In sloping areas, for example, erosion can inhibit the processes
of soil formation. Wetness can slow these processes in level or depressional areas.
The parent material also affects the kind of soil profile that is formed. Finally, time is
needed for changing the parent material into a soil profile that has clearly differentiated
horizons.
The factors of soil formation are so closely interrelated in their effects on the soil
that few generalizations can be made regarding the effects of any one factor unless
the effects of the other factors are known. Many of the processes of soil formation are
unknown.
Parent Material
Parent material is the unconsolidated geologic material in which a soil forms. It
determines the chemical and mineralogical composition of the soil. Most of the parent
material in Douglas County is a direct result of the glaciers and sediments of the
Wisconsinan Stage of the Pleistocene Epoch (Willman and Frye, 1970). Although the
kinds of parent material are associated with glacial deposits, the properties vary
greatly, mostly because of varying modes of deposition. The dominant kinds of parent
material in Douglas County are till, loess, outwash, alluvium, colluvium, and lacustrine
sediments. These materials were deposited by wind, water, glaciers, or glacial
meltwater. In some areas, the materials have been reworked by wind or water after
deposition. Many of the soils formed in more than one kind of parent material. For
example, some of the soils in Douglas County formed in loess and in the underlying
till.
Till is material laid down directly by glaciers with a minimum of water action. It
consists of clay, silt, sand, rock fragments, and boulders, all of which are mixed
together. The rock fragments have distinct edges and corners, indicating that they
have not been subject to intensive abrasion by flowing water. Unweathered till is
generally calcareous and very dense. Through processes of weathering and soil
