sing. Farm managers, in most cases, select their own time
of harvest so it may be coordinated with other farm opera-
tions. This generally provides a steady flow of sugarbeet
roots to the factory for processing and piling even though
potential yields are not generally reached by early Octo-
ber harvest.
The extent of the yield loss caused by early harvest
will depend upon the time of actual harvest and the time
that the roots would normally be harvested (11, 13).
Figure 3 shows the values for the production factors ob-
tained from early harvest as percentages of the values ob-
tained from the harvest on 24 October for each of the
three years. The values are plotted as percentages of the
maximum assuming that near maximum production is reached
by late October. Although the actual sucrose concentra-
tions and yields varied widely for the three years, the
percentage of the maximum values for the four production
factors was remarkably uniform with only a few signifi-
cant variations.
Similar production data are plotted in Figure 4 using
average values for the three years; but, in this case, the
