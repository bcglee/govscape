cent extractable sucrose. Sugarbeets that are subject to
freezing temperatures and higher soil moisture levels
generally have a higher water content which could account
for the decrease in sucrose and dry matter concentrations.
The critical air temperature of -4.4Â°C, where growth pro-
cesses are stopped for sugarbeets (1), was reached on 19
October and during several periods in November (Figure 1).
The low temperature at October harvest probably stopped
all growth processes and yield benefits from later har-
vest. However, during certain years, this critical tem-
perature is reached at a much later date and during those
years some yield benefits would probably be achieved by
the later harvest period.
The overwintering of the sugarbeet roots without cover
for spring harvest caused a deterioration in both their
physical and chemical quality during the two years of this
study (Tables 2, 3). Starting in January and continuing
for the remainder of the period of freezing and thawing
temperatures, the crowns of a high percentage of the roots
without cover developed a softness. The softness and
later rot in the crowns moved through the center of the
root and eventually throughout the entire root with in-
creasing spring temperatures. The initial softness of the
crown was probably the result of freezing with lower night
temperatures and thawing with warmer daytime tempera-
tures. This deterioration of the crown provided an en-
trance for the fungal pathogens that cause rot (4). Tem-
perature fluctuation can be minimized by the addition of
an insulating material over the crowns and soil.
The uncovered roots that were classified as hard, and
could be harvested with a mechanical harvester, ranged
from 46 to 74 percent and from 69 to 93 percent for the
top vegetative covered roots during the 1982-83 season
(Table 2). Moisture stress and dehydration of the sugar-
beets increased the numbers of roots that were soft for
both the covered and uncovered plot areas. The GWD2 hy-
brid had a higher number and percentage of roots that were
classified as hard when compared with the other two hy-
