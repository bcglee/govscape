harvest with growth rates greatest from mid-July until
late August for the three years, as shown in Figure 2A (5,
8, 9). The root yield level and the rate of growth
depended upon the climatic conditions for each year,
available nutrients, and the yield potential of the sugar-
beet hybrid grown. Growth rates during each of the years
were reduced during September and October as day and night
time temperatures decreased.
Sucrose concentration in the beet roots increased most
rapidly during June and July (9, 14). From late July
until harvest, the rate of increase in sucrose concentra-
tion was rather uniform for each of the three years pro-
vided that extra N was not taken up from residual or ap-
plied sources (Figure 2B). The sucrose concentration
level depended upon the year and climatic conditions, N
nutritional status of the plant, and the sugarbeet hybrid
grown. During these studies, we found no indication of
the commonly expected large increase in sucrose concentra-
tion during the latter part of the growing season when
temperatures reduce the growth and respiration processes
which is commonly called "sugaring up".
Total sucrose accumulation and extractable sucrose
yields in the roots followed a consistent pattern for the
three years with the greatest rates of increase in sucrose
accumulation from late July until early September (Figure
2C, D). During each of the years, sucrose accumulation
rates were reduced from early September until harvest with
decreasing day and night temperatures. Total sucrose pro-
duction is based on the product of root yield and sucrose
concentration within the roots. Therefore, total sucrose
accumulation and yields were affected by the same clima-
tic, growth, and nutritional factors as root yield and
sucrose concentration in total yield potential at any time
during the season.
Sugarbeets in the cooler regions of the United States
are normally harvested during the period from early
October to mid-November when the temperatures are low
enough for storing excess roots in piles for later proces-
