It has been reported (1) that sucrose accumulation
continues in the fall until the minimum air temperature
reaches -4.4°C or 24°F. At this temperature, photosynthe-
sis and transport mechanisms are damaged to the point that
growth processes stop even though the leaves remain up-
right and green during the warmer periods of the day.
When the minimum temperature reaches -8°C (17.6F) or be-
low, the leaves are killed and do not recover during the
warmer periods of the day. The time that the minimum tem-
perature of -4.4°C is reached in the intermountain area of
the West varies with season and location. In this area,
it generally occurs in late October but may be as late as
the middle of November. In the two years of this study,
the minimum temperature of -4.4°C was reached on 19 Octo-
ber 1982, and on 9 November 1983 (Figure 1). Growth pro-

ceases should continue to these dates or beyond depending
upon the temperature and conditions at the leaf surface.
