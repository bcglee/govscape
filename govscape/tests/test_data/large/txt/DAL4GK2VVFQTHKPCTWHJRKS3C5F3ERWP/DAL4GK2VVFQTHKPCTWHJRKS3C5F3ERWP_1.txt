MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two irrigated field experiments were conducted on
Portneuf silt loam soil (Durixerollic Calciorthids,
coarse-silty, mixed, mesic) near Twin Falls, Idaho, in the
1982-83 and 1983-84 seasons. The soil has a weakly ce-
mented hardpan at the 50- to 60- cm depth that has little
effect on water movement when saturated but may restrict
root penetration. The areas used were deficient in nitro-
gen (N) and phosphorus (P) and required 56 kg P/ha (15)
and 224 kg N/ha (7) for an expected maximum yield of 63
metric tons/ha of beet roots. The N and P fertilizers
were applied as a broadcast application and incorporated
with the upper 10 cm of soil as the seedbed was prepared.
Four replications involving four irrigation levels as
main plots and three commercial hybrid cultivars as sub-
plots were used in the 1982-83 season. Three of these
replications received no further treatment; whereas one
replication of each treatment was used as a covered plot
during the winter months. During the 1983-84 season, four
replications of a split-plot design with twelve winter
cover treatments as main plots, and two commercial hybrids
as subplots, were used. Each plot area was 8.9 by 12.2 m
in 1982-83 and 8.9 by 11.0 m in the 1983-84 season.
Three hybrids (AH-10, W5-76, and GWD2) were planted in
16 row plots on 23 April 1982 and two hybrids (WS-76 and
W5-88) in 16 row plots on 18 April 1983. All hybrids were
planted in 56-cm rows that had previously been marked and
treated with aldicarb at 2.24 kg of active ingredient per
hectare to control insects. The sugarbeets were thinned
to a 23-30-cm within row spacing in early June.
Four alternate row furrow irrigation levels MI, H2,
M3 and H4 were used during the 1982 season and the MI ir-
rigation treatment during the 1983 season. The irrigation
treatments were as follows:
MI - Adequate irrigation based on previous experi-
ments. Irrigation dates were based on estimated
soil moisture depletion (12) and irrigation dura-
