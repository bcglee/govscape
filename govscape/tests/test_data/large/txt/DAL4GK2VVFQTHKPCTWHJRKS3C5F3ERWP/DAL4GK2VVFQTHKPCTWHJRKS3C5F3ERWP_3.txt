tops were applied at the rate of 160 metric tons/ha (tops
from three equal areas). Straw was applied at the rate of
17.92 metric tons/ha.
Root samples were manually harvested from six uniform
3-m row sections from each plot on 28 October, 7 December,
and 1 March in the 1982-83 study and from selected plots
on 18 October and 21 March in the 1983-84 experiment.
Root samples were cleaned, root and crown tissue were
separated at the lowest leaf scar, weighed, and triplicate
root samples (14 to 18 roots per sample) were taken for
sucrose, purity, and other analyses. The sucrose concen-
tration, purity, and other analyses were determined by The
Amalgamated Sugar Company.
The specific procedures used for other studies can be
found in earlier articles; i.e., 1977 (9), 1978 (8), and
1982 (S). These experiments were all conducted on
Portneuf silt loam soil and were the average values for
all preplant N fertilizer applications on the MI irriga-
tion treatment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There are two apparent ways to increase the volume of
beet roots that can be handled by processors using exis-
ting equipment and facilities in the intermountain areas
of the western United States. The first would be to har-
vest and process the sugarbeet roots earlier than normal
during September and early October. The early harvest
would have the dual advantage of increasing the length of
time that beet roots can be processed in the existing
factories and generally having better weather conditions
for harvest. The root and sucrose yields continue to in-
crease in the late summer and early fall so earlier har-
vest has the disadvantage of reduced sucrose yields. The
second would be to overwinter the beet roots in the field
for harvest in the spring. The spring harvest has the po-
tential advantage of capturing any increased root and suc-
rose yield benefits that take place from normal harvest
until late fall when low temperatures stop all photosyn-
thesis and growth processes.
