and without insulating materials, deteriorate both physi-
cally and chemically to the extent that they would have
little value for processing using existing facilities.
Sugarbeet roots harvested and processed earlier than the
normal harvest period during October may lose up to 35
percent of their maximum sucrose potential depending upon
the harvest period in relation to the normal harvest
period. Early harvest and processing of beet roots would
increase the tonnage of roots that can be processed with
existing equipment, increase the number of hectares
allotted for sugarbeet production, and improve the economy
of the sugar industry.
