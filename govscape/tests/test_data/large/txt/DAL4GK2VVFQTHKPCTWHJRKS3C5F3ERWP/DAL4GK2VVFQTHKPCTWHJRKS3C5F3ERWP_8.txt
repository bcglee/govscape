considered 100%, or maximum, and the values for prior
dates of harvest are plotted as percentages of these maxi-
mums. The percentage of the maximum yields or sucrose
concentrations vary from 65 to 100 percent with the extent
of the decreases in the components depending upon the
yield factor involved or the time of harvest in relation
to the normal harvest period. The average reduction per
week in percentage of the maximum extractable sucrose be-
tween early September and harvest was 6.6, 5.9, 5.4 and
4.9 for the 3, 10, 17 and 24 October normal harvest
period, respectively. However, the greatest total reduc-
tion on all yields and yield factors occurred between the
earliest harvest and latest normal harvest period.
There were no significant changes in the yield com-
ponents or yields caused by a December harvest when com-
pared with those beet roots harvested in late October
(Table 1). The only consistent, but insignificant,
