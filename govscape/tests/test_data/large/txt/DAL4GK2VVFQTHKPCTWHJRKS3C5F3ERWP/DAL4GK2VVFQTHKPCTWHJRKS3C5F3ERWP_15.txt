irrigated (Table 4). Failure of the wetter soil to absorb
as much water as the drier soil was probably due to both
greater runoff and some deep percolation in the wetter
soil. Consequently, it appears that the major portion of
the water saved by withholding irrigation during August,
September, and October was replaced during the winter
months. This has the extra benefit of elimination of
winter season deep percolation that results in nitrate
loss.
In conclusion, the results of these experiments
clearly show there is very little, if any, advantage to
harvesting sugarbeet roots in the intermountain area of
the western United States after the normal October period.
Cold temperatures during the latter part of October and
early November either reduce or stop photosynthesis and
the accumulation of sucrose in the roots. Freezing tem-
peratures during the latter part of October and November
nay change the proportions of sucrose and other sugars
