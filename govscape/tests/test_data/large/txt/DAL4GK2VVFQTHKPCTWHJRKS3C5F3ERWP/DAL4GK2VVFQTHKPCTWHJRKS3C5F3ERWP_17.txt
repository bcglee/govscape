in the roots as well as affect the storability of the
roots. Sugarbeets held in the soil throughout the winter
months deteriorate both physically and chemically. Al-
though the physical quality of the roots can be improved
with insulation from various plant materials that are
readily available in the field, inversion of the sugars
within the roots occurs to the extent that they have
little value for processing using our existing equipment.
However, these roots could have a use in the production of
alcohol where the sugar composition is not important (6).
The early opening of the sugarbeet processing plants
and early harvest of the roots for immediate processing
seems to be the only viable option identified in this
study for increasing the amount of roots processed using
existing factory equipment. Although the roots harvested
early have physical quality equal to those harvested later
in the fall (11), there can be up to a 35 percent loss in
the extractable sucrose potential depending upon the har-
vest time in relation to the normal harvest period. How-
ever, there are also losses of sucrose in the beet piles
from beets harvested during periods of maximum yields due
to respiration, freezing and thawing, and decomposition
(2, 16, 17). Early harvest of the sugarbeet roots would
increase the tonnage of roots that can be processed with
existing facilities, increase the number of hectares al-
lotted for sugarbeet production, and improve the economy
of the sugar industry.
SUMMARY
Two sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) experiments and data
collected during three years in other studies were used to
evaluate early and late fall, and spring harvest of beet
roots. The results of these experiments clearly show
there is very little, if any, advantage to harvesting
sugarbeet roots in this climatic zone after the normal
October period. Cold temperatures before or shortly after
the late October period either reduce or stop photosynthe-
sis and the accumulation of sucrose in the roots. Sugar-
beets held in the field throughout the winter months, with
