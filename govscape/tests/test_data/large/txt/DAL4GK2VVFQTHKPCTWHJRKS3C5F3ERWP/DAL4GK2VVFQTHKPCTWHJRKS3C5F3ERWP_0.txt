INTRODUCTION
Sugarbeets (Beta vulgaris L.) in the intermountain
areas of the western United States are normally planted in
early spring and harvested during October with the advent
of cool temperatures. The beet roots during this harvest-
ing period are near their maximum yield and sucrose con-
centration. Temperatures are cool and suitable for
storing excess roots in piles for later processing. The
factory processing of beet roots is presently limited to
the period between harvest and mid-February after which
stored roots in piles deteriorate rapidly in quality with
increased temperatures (2, 10, 16, 17).
The closing of some sugar factories, and low prices
currently received for other crops, has intensified demand
by farm managers for increased acreage allotment for
sugarbeets. Present low world sugar prices and the uncer-
tainty of continued sugar legislation discourages the ex-
pansion of the cutting and processing facilities in fac-
tories. Methods and procedures are needed to increase the
tonnage of beet roots that can be processed using existing
equipment and facilities.
The objective of this study was to evaluate methods
and procedures where factories can increase the amount of
beet roots processed with existing equipment by methods
such as early and late fall and spring harvest of
