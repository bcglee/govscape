tion depended on the amount to be applied.
M2 A light irrigation (50 mm) was applied on 1 Sep-
tember after the soil profile was filled with
water on 1 August. Irrigations were the same as
Ni before 1 August.
K3 No irrigation was applied after the soil profile
was filled with water on 1 August. Irrigations
were the same as Hi before 1 August.
M4 No irrigations after the soil profile was filled
with water on 19 July. Irrigations were the same
as HI before 19 July.
The soil water content in the 0- to 20- cm depth was
determined gravimetrically from 9 November 1982 to 15
April 1983. One access tube located within the row in
each hybrid and moisture treatment and a calibrated neu-
tron probe were used to measure soil moisture in the 20-
to 100-cm depth. In addition, one access tube located on
each of the AN-10 hybrids and MI and M4 irrigation treat-
ments was used to measure the soil moisture to the 300 cm
depth.
Following the October harvest, cover treatments were
applied to specified plots in the 1982-83 and 1983-84 ex-
periments. In the 1982-83 experiment, cover treatment
consisted of applying the tops from two equal areas to
sugarbeets on one replication of each treatment. All
other sugarbeets for this year were left untreated as to
cover. In the 1983-84 experiment, cover treatments were
applied to areas 8 rows wide by 4.3 m long. The treat-
ments imposed consisted of: (1) leaves on (the sugar-
beet), and 2) leaves off; 3) leaves on, and 4) leaves
off, both with soil cover; 5) leaves on, and 6) leaves
off, both with top vegetative cover; 7) leaves on, and 8)
leaves off, both with soil cover and top vegetative cover;
9) leaves on, and 10) leaves off, both with straw cover;
and 11) leaves on, and 12) leaves off, both with soil and
straw cover. Leaves were removed with a beater that had
rubber flails. Soil cover consisted of covering the root
crowns with soil using potato killers and disks. Beet
