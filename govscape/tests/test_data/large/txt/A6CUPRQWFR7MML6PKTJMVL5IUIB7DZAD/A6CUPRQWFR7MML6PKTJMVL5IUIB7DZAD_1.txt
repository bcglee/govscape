Introduction
A fall 2004 collection of a female woodwasp in a New York survey trap was
identified in February 2005 as Sirex noctilio. Infested red and Scots pines were
subsequently found in nearby Oswego, NY later that spring. Delimitation
trapping surveys conducted in summer and fall 2005 recovered S. noctilio
specimens in 5 counties around Oswego, NY. In late fall of 2005, it was
announced that S. noctilio was recovered from two locations in Ontario, Canada,
approximately 100 miles from the New York infestation. These collections
represent the first known establishment of S. noctilio in North America.
Sirex noctilio is a woodwasp native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa that has
been inadvertently introduced into a number of countries in the southern
hemisphere including: New Zealand, Australia, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and South Africa. In its native range, where it is generally considered to be a
secondary pest, it attacks pines almost exclusively, e.g., Scots (Pinus sylvestris),
Austrian (P. nigra), and maritime (P. pinaster) pines. In the southern
hemisphere the insect has caused upwards of 80 percent mortality in plantations
of North American pines especially Monterey pine (P. radiata) and loblolly pine
(P. taeda). Other known susceptible pines include slash (P. elliottii), shortleaf (P.
echinata), ponderosa (P. ponderosa), lodgepole (P. contorta), and jack (P.
banksiana).
Although the area of known infestation in New York State does not have
extensive pine forests, there are at least 11 softwood lumber producing sawmills
in the infested counties. In addition, in the eight counties surrounding the
infested area there are numerous sawmills with a combined annual softwood
capacity of 51MMBF. The most significant economic impact will be if the
woodwasp spreads to the pine forests of the southern US.
This economic analysis was conducted to project the impact of mortality caused
by Sirex noctilio on the pine forests of the South. Infestations of Sirex will likely
have the greatest impact on the sawtimber and pulpwood industries, and
although impacts on the Christmas tree industry, as well as ecological impacts
may be significant, they were not part of this analysis.
There are still many unknowns about the biology of Sirex noctilio in North
America, and many assumptions had to be made for this analysis. Although
there are several native Sirex species in North America, it is not known how this
non-native will interact in this new environment. The interaction of S. noctilio
(and its fungal associate) with native predators, parasites, tree defenses and
abiotic factors will ultimately determine tree level and stand level mortality, as
well as rate of spread across the area. Anthropogenic movement of infested
material, such as untreated wood products and pallets, would greatly increase
the spread rate from New York. This analysis used a conservative 25 miles/year
natural spread rate; any human-aided movement would significantly increase the
economic impacts.
