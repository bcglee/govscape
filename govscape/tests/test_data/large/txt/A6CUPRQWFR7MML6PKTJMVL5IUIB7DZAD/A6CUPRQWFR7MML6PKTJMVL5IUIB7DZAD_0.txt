Economic Analysis of the Potential Impact of Sirex noctilio,
With Emphasis on Pines in the Southeastern United States

Executive Summary
• Sirex noctilio, a woodwasp native to Europe, Asia and north Africa, was
first found in New York in February, 2005. Delimiting surveys have found
it in five counties in New York and recently in Ontario, Canada.
• There has been significant mortality of North American pines planted in
other countries infested with this woodwasp.
• Although it is not known what impacts Sirex will have on the forests of
North America, there is concern that it could cause mortality and economic
loss.
• This economic analysis assumed that Sirex would spread from the current
New York infestation at 25 miles/year and take 55 years to infest the entire
southeastern US.
• A current estimate of sawtimber and pulpwood values were used, and all
future values were discounted to the present using a 4% discount rate.
• At a 10% mortality threshold, in the South, there would be 244 million
square feet lost valued at $1.9 billion dollars; in the total infested area, 360
million square feet and $2.9 billion would be lost.
• If mortality reaches 50%, losses would reach 1.4 billion square feet and
$11 billion lost in the South, and 2.1 billion square feet and $17 billion in
the infested area.
