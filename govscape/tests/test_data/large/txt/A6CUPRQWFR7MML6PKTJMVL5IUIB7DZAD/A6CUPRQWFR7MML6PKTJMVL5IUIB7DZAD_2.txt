The USDA Forest Service, Forest Health Protection, Forest Health Technology
Enterprise Team (FHTET) has developed hazard models for Sirex noctilio
based on risk of introduction and establishment. The establishment surface,
based on susceptible host species basal area (BA) was the basis for calculating
the spread and impact of Sirex in this analysis. The following methods and
assumptions were used throughout this economic analysis:
• The rate of spread is estimated at 25 miles/year, and assumes no
management, control or regulatory actions. This rate is based on experience
from other countries infested with S. noctilio.
• At this rate of spread, the woodwasp would spread south from New York State,
and take approximately 55 years to reach western Texas, therefore, this
analysis was carried out for this 55 year period
• Basal area at risk by year was calculated based upon a pre-existing map of
pine basal area used to develop the Sirex noctilio risk map (Figure 1, also see:
http://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/technology/riskmaps/docs/sirexsusceptibility_s
urface.pdf )
• Future iterations of the risk model will take into account vulnerability and
anthropogenic movement of pine materials from the infested area. This would
greatly affect economic impact by accelerating movement of S. noctilio into
new areas, and any future economic analysis will take these factors into
account as well
• We assume that a wave of mortality moves across this pine basal area map as
the pest spreads from NY at maximum realizable mortality rates of 10% and
50%. These rates were chosen as moderate (10%) and high (50%) impacts
that S. noctilio may have in North America
• The model produced basal area lost (square feet) for each pixel in the risk map
in rings 25 miles wide as the woodwasp spread from New York
• It was assumed that the mortality rates used in this analysis would not occur all
in the first year of infestation; therefore mortality in each infested area was
spread over a five year period.
• The only monetary value lost considered was for sawtimber and pulpwood.
Although infestations by this insect will have other economic impacts, including
costs for management and control, they were not considered in this analysis
• To estimate monetary value of the basal area lost, square feet of basal area
was converted into board feet for sawtimber assuming that there were 2.7
sixteen-foot merchantable logs (4”-6” mean top diameter) per tree
• Square feet of basal area was converted into a pulpwood cord measure
assuming 3.3 eight-foot sticks per tree
• Current prices for sawtimber and pulpwood were obtained from Timber Mart
South and several individual state’s websites, and were estimated to be
$300/MBF for sawtimber and $20/cord for pulpwood
• Based on the Southern Forest Resource Assessment, the distribution of
softwood timberland was estimated to be 57% sawtimber and 43% pulpwood
• We applied a blended sawtimber/pulpwood value of $29.20 /square foot of
basal area
• All future values were discounted to the present (2005) using a 4% discount
rate
• We assume there would be markets for all projected timber value lost
