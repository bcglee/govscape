The basal area and value lost for both of these mortality thresholds assumes no
management or control actions, and a constant 25 mile/year rate of spread, with
no long distance human-aided dispersal. Whereas a faster rate of spread would
affect the timber prices and discounted value used in the calculations, control
and regulatory measures would reduce the impact and slow the spread rate.
The values lost for both of these scenarios may not be realized if control and
regulatory actions are implemented. They point to the potential impact that this
species may have on the pine forests of the southern US, and the need for
mitigation. Even with a conservative spread rate and 10% mortality, there may
be losses of $57 million per year. Mitigation to slow the spread and reduce
mortality would result in significant cost-benefit savings even if management and
control programs cost $10-20 million per year.
