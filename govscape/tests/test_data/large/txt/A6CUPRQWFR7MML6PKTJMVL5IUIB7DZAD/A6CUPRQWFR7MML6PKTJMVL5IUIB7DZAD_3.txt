Analysis
Based on a 25mile/year spread of Sirex noctilio from the current infestation near
Oswego, New York, it would take approximately 55 years for the woodwasp to
completely infest the pine growing region of the South. Within 10 years, Virginia
would be the first state to become infested in the South, and in 42 years it will be
reaching the Gulf Coast in Alabama.

The 10% mortality threshold model would result in a total loss of pine basal area
of 244 million square feet over the 55 year infestation period (Table 1). Georgia,
which has the highest basal area of pine in the South, would experience the
greatest loss of 50 million square feet beginning 25 years from the present.
Based on a 4% discount rate, the total present value lost in the South would be
more than $1.9 billion. The non-southern states infested during this 55 year time
period would experience an additional $968,000 loss. At the 50% mortality
threshold in the South, both the basal area lost and the value lost would greatly
increase to 1.4 billion square feet and $11 billion, respectively (Table 2).
