6 through 10 of gestation. Fetotoxicity and abnormalities such as the
absence of eyelid and delayed bead ossification increased with TCDD
content in the 2,4,5-T. cleft palates and cystic kidneys were not
observed in hamsters.
Snarson et al, (9) also evaluated the teratogenic effects of a
routine production lot of 2,4,5-T containing 0.5 pps TCDD using groups
of female New Zealand White rabbits. Each group received 0, 10, 20 or
40 rag 2,4,5-T/kg daily on days 6 through 18 of pregnancy. No anatomical
malformations were observed and it was concluded that under the conditions
of this experiment,, 2,4,5-T was not teratogenic to rabbits.
â€¢nwmpaon, Bnerson and Sparschu (20) also used groups of New
Zealand White rabbits to study the taratogenic effects of 2,4,5-T.
Visceral and skeletal examinations did not reveal teratogenic effects
in any of the groups of rabbits given daily oral doses of 10, 20 or
40 rag 2,4,5-T/kg on days 6 through IS of gestation.
Sheep were used by Binns and Balls (2) to test the teratogenioity
of 2,4,5-T containing 1 ppn of 1X3DD. Teratogenic effects were not
induced in any of the lanfcs from ewes fed as much as 113 ng 2,4,5-T/kg
body weight for various periods during gestation.
Dougherty, Coulston and Golberg (7) subjected mature female Rhesus
monkeys (Macaca roulatta) to 2,4,5-T containing less than 0.05 ppn TCDD.
CJancentrations of 0*05, 1*0 or 10.0 mgr 2,4,5-TAg body weight ware
given to the test groups from day 22 through 28 of pregnancy. Detailed
examination of the live infants and one stillborn fetus revealed no
gross develcpnantal abnorrtality in any of the groups. Therefore, within
