evident at the higher doses. It is believed, however, that the 1CDD
present as a cjontamtoant in the 2,4,5-T tested earlier may hove aooounted
for the reported observations of teratogenic effects which 'were attributed
to 2,4,5-tf.
Following the prcxsedures used by Bnsrsoti et al. (9), bat increasing
the dose levels to 50 and 100 reg 2,4,5-<PAg/day> Sparschu et al. (19)
showed no teratogenic effects with ooimercdal-grade 2,4,5-7 containing
0.5 ppn TCDD. The higher dose showed severe mternal toxicity and seme
fetal toxicity.
Thompson, Bnerson and Sparschu (20), again using ooranercially
produced 2,4,5-T, treated Sprague-Dawley cats orally with doses of
1, 3, 6, 12, 24 or 50 rag/kg/day on days 6 through 15 of gestation* A
dose of 100 lag/kg/day of 2,4,5-T was given to rats on days 6 through 10
of gestation. Bats treated with tp to 50 mg/kg/day did not reveal
teratogenio effects* The 100 ing/kg/day dose produced maternal toxicity
and death and some fetuses which showed toxic effects, but no teratogenic
effects.
Khera and Roddick (12) reported no teratogenic effects by treating
female Wistar rats orally with 0.125*16 yg/tag/day of TCDD during days
6 through 15 of gestation. However, postnatal survival of the pups was
severely decreased with increased prenatal doses* The investigators
reasoned that this was due to entaryonic damage induced by the TCDD.
Another test animal used to study the teratogenic effects of TCDD
was the golden Syrian hamster. Collins and Williams (4) administered
2,4,5-T containing varying amounts of TCDD to groups of hamsters on days
6
