A REVIEW OF OTE TERA3XX3ENICHY OF TCDD
INTRODUCTION
During the manufacture of the herbicide 2,
add (2,4,5-T) a highly toxic iapurity, 2,3,7,8Ha9trachloeodiberizc>~p-
dioxin (TODD) , may be formed. TODD was named as the culprit in cases
of drijoracne and chtcdc edema disease In the 1940 's and the 1950 's.
Attention waa focused cm the possible taratogenlc effects of TOO) in the
late 1960's whim 2,4,5-T was used as a defoliant in certain areas of
South Vietnam* Recent descriptions of the teratogenic effects of TODD
began when Courtney et al. (5) released a study using mice and rats
treated with 2,4,5-T containing approximately 30 parts per million (ppm)
of TOD.
Using two strains of mice, Courtney et ajU (5) reported an increase
in the incidence of deft palate in both the C57BL/6 and the AKR strain
of mice when pregnant females were subjected to 2,4,5-T either sub-
cutanaoualy or orally on days 6 through 14 or days 9 through 17 of
gestation for the C57BI/6 strain and days â‚¬ through 16 for the AKR
strain. Only the C57HL/6 strain showed an increased incidence of cystic
kidney. Doses varied from 21.5 mg to 113*0 mb 2,4,5-T per Kg of body
weight with the 2,4,5-T containing approodmately 30 ppm of TCDD,
Subsequently, other taratological studies using mice have shown
that varying dose levels could affect prenatal development in mice.
