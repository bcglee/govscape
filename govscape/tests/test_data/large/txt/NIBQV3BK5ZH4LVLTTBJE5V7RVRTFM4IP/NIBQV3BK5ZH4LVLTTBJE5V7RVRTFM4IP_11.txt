Nsubert gt al. (15). For this reason these four reports nay be considered
somewhat inocwplete.
To properly test a drug &xr tetrabogenic effects at least two
species of test animals should be used (16) * Many criteria are to be
considered when selecting test animals to be used in teratological
investigations. According to Clegg (3) scma of these criteria are
availability, ease of maintenance, economics, gestation period/ estrus
cycle, fertility in captivity, litter size, etc. All criteria are
probably best met by the hamster, mouse, rabbit and rat. Extrapolation
of the experimental data to man would necessitate the selection of test
animals whose embryonic development and metabolic parameters are similar
to those in man. Manhattan primates may be the animals of choice when
metabolic data on the drug is not known*
Only four of the investigating teams reviewed used two species of
test animals (references 5, 6, 9 and 20). 3be rat was selected by all
four, the rabbit by two, and the mouse by two* One team of investigators
used sheep (2) which is not one of the recxamvended species, but was
probably readily available. Collins and Williams (4) selected hamsters
while Dougherty, Ooulston and Golberg (7) used the Rhesus monkey which
would seem to be an animal of choice if one were trying to extrapolate
the results of the teratological investigations to man. Strangely enough,
the highly TCCO-sensitive guinea pig was never selected as a test animal.
It would be interesting to compare the high toxicity seen in the adult
of this species with any possible teratogenic effects on the fetus and
with data obtained from other animals such as rats and mice*
