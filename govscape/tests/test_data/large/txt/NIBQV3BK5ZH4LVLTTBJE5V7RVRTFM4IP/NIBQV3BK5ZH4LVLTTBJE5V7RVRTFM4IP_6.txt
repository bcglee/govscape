Using a CD strain of rats, Courtney and Moore (6) found that
neither 2,4,5-T nor TCDD produced cleft palate in rat fetuses when
given on days 6 through 15 of gestation. However, it was found that
2,4,5-T produced only a minimal response in kidney malformation while
TCDD produced a 34 percent incidence of malformation.
Since many of the conclusions concerning the teratogeaiicity of
TCDD were drawn from results of studies using TCDD contaminated 2,4,5-T,
Emerson et al. (9) attempted to evaluate the teratogenic effects of a
routine production lot of 2,4,5-T containing 0.5 ppm TCDD. Groups of
Sprague-Dawlay female rats ware dosed once daily on days 6 through 15
of pregnancy with 1,3,6,12 or 24 mg 2,4,5-TAg. Examination of all
fetuses following Caesarean section on day 20 of gestation revealed no
teratogenic effects. Therefore, in this experiment, 2,4,5-T was not
teratogenic to rats nor was TCDD at the ccaiocaitration of 0.5 ppn.
Khera, Huston and MoKinley (11), using 2,4,5-T herbicide containing
less than 0.5 ppat TCDD, found no apparent teratogenic effects using
25 rag 2,4,5-T/kg/day on Wistar rats during days 6 through 15 of gestation.
Using a dose level of 50 mg/kg/day, the significance of the teratogenic
effects observed was inconclusive.
To determine if TCDD actually caused the teratogenic effects
attributed to 2,4,5-T by Courtney et al. (5), Sparschu, Dunn and Bowe (18)
subjected Sprague-Dawlay rats to orally administered TCDD on days â‚¬
through 15 of gestation at levels of 0, 0.03, 0.125, 0.5, 2,0 and
8.0 yg/kg/day. Cleft palate and cystic kidneys were not observed in
this study although both maternal toxicity and artoryotoxicity were
