Very faw taratologloal studies have been done with TCDD alone aa the
agent. Usually TCDD is studied in confeination with another agent such
aa 2,4,5-7. Many of the early studies were done with very high concen-
trations of TCDD. indeed, one ouch study was completed before the
concentration of the TOB in the 2,4,5-T was even known (5). Later
investigations also used TCDD in ccwbination with 2,4,5-T, but at a much
lower and more realistic concentration (7). In addition, in an attempt
to more closely approach the embryonic development and metabolic parameters
found in man, Rhesus monkeys have been employed as test animals.
The highly cmtroversial question as to the potential hazard to man
resulting from exposure to 2,4,5-T containing even a minimal amount of
TCDD still remains to be settled* However, it appears from these
studies that the teratogenic effects of TCDD in 2,4,5-T will not be seen
at concentrations below approximately 10 ppiu
