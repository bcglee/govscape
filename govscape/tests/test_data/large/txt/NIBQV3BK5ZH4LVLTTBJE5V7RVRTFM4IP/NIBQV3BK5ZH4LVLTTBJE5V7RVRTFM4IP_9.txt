the oanditions of this experiment, there was no evidence that 2,4,5-T
containing less than 0.05 ppn TCDD is teratogenic in the Rhesus monkey.
Neubert et al. (15), in reviewing the data on the teratogenic
effects obtained using pure TCDD, noted that doses as low as 1-10 yg/kg
could produce nalformations of certain types. The two major types of
malformations were cleft palate, reported only in mice, and kidney
abnormalities, observed in both mice and rats, No mention was made of
using pure TCDD in teratological experiments performed with any other
species, even those that are highly sensitive to TCDD. The investigators
found that potentiation can occur after treatment with a single dose of
a combination of two or more known teratogenes* This was the case with
the TCED~2,3,5-T combination, but not when nonteratogenic doses of
2,4,5-T are used with less than 10-20 ppm TCDD.
DISCUSSION
One Pood and Drug Aarainistration expects three studies to be
completed in order for a drug to be acceptable for use (16). These
three tests are: (1) study of fertility and general reproductive
performance; (2) teratological study; and (3) perinatal and postnatal
study. The United Kingdom's Ctmnittee on Safety of Drugs differs from
the FDA in that it will accept a teratology study alone, but the drug
must be administered from day one of gestation until just before term
rather than during the period of embryogenesis as accepted by the FDA.
All of the articles reviewed above reported teratogenic studies with
the addition of postnatal studies being reported by Khera, Houston and
MsKinley (11), Khera and Ruddick (12), and Moore et al. (13).
