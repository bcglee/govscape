Subsequently, other fceratological studies using mice have shown
that varying dose levels could affect prenatal development in mice.
Specifically, the only taratogenic affects observed were an increased
frequency of cleft palate and cystic kidneys, a special type of kidney
abnormality. Other toxic signs were noised but cannot be referred to as
taratogenic since they can also be demonstrated in the adult after
treatment with TCDD (15).
Courtney and Moore (6), by using varying dose levels and mixtures
of 2,4,5-T and. TCDD, attempted to determine if the previously reported
teratogenic results (Oourtney et al. (5) ware due to 2,4,5-T, TCDD or
the combination of the two. Cleft palates were produced in all strains
of mice tested using 2,4,5-T, TCDD and the combination with no potentia-
tion of the teratogenic effect using the ccnbination. Interestingly,
the less pure grade of 2,4,5-T (Technical) produced less kidney anomalies
than did the purest grade of 2,4,5-T (analytical) while treatment with
TCDD produced a narked increase in kidney anomalies. An additional
finding of the study was that the C57B1/6J strain of mice are the most
susceptible to TCDD-induced effects.
A later study by Hart and Valerio (10) was able to show only a
marginally significant increase in incidence of cleft palate and no causal
relationship between other observed abnormalities and treatment with
2,4,5-T. In JiMition to using 2,4,5-T instead of pure TOD, the
investigators used the CD-I strain of mice rather than the C57B1/6J
strain which is more sensitive to the teratogen.
