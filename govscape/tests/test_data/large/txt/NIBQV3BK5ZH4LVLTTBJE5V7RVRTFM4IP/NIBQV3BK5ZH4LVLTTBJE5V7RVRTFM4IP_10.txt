According to Baboon (16), when a teratology study is done, the
drug should be given during the period of organogenesis, which would be
about days 6 through 15 for mice and rats, and days € through 18 for
rabbits, With the exception of Bag©, Cekanova and Larsson (1) (days
6 through 14 for ndoa) and Moore et al. (13) (days 10 through 13 for
mice) all investigators administered the test doses over the prescribed
time period. In addition, Moore at al. (13), Neubert and Dillman (14)
and Noubert et al. (15) tested single doses during the period of
organogenesis.
All the investigators in the reviewed articles have satisfied the
HIA recommendation of two dose levels. With ti» esxceptions of references
1, 2, 10, 13 and 19 the reports also satisfied the British recommendation
of at least three dose levels. Some teams such as Neubert and Dillman (14)
employed as many as 20 dose levels.
It has been reccranended (16) that offspring be removed by Caesaraan
section one or two days before term* For the most part all offspring
were collected in this manner. Birms and Balls (2) allowed the ewes
to go to term (160 days) as did Oourtney and Moore ()€ , Thompson, Emerson
and Sparschu (2), and Khera and Ruddiok (12) with rats. Dougherty,
Ooulston and Qolberg (7) also allowed the monkeys to go to term (164 days).
With few exceptions, fetuses have been examined for both visceral
anomalies and skeletal abnormalities. For some reason Binns and Balls (2)
did not report what examinations were made, but only that the offspring
were normal after birth* .fin. examination for skeletal abnormalities was
not mentioned by Courtney and Moore (6), Moore et al. (13), and
