the findings of Moore et at. (13) supported the cfcservations made
Jay Courtney and Moore (6) of the teratogenic effects of TCDD on mice
of the C57B1/6 strain, deft palate was reported with an incidence of
55.4 percent while kidney anomalies were found with an incidence of
95.1 percent when the dose was 3yg TCDD/kg given on gestation days
10 through 13* With a dose level of lyg/kg on the sane days, the
incidence levels dropped to zero and 58.9 percent for cleft palate and
kidney anomalies, respectively.
Starting with Courtney et al. (5) the rat has also been used to
test the teratogeniciiy of TCDD. The only teratogenic evidence seen was
that of cystic kidneys. These investigators failed to say what strain
of rats were used or to describe the renal anomalies other than as cystic
kidneys. The 2,4,5-T used in the treatment contained approximately 30 ppm
of TCDD.
The results of a study by Emerson et al. (8) failed to substantiate
the finding of Courtney et al. (5)Â« Examination of fetuses failed to
reveal any serious teratogenic effects when the dams were given daily
doses of 2,4,5-T containing approximately 27 ppm of TCDD on days 6
through 15 of gestation. In this study Spragxie-Dawley rats were used
as expertoantal animals.
Sparschu, Dunn and Howe (17) gave TCDD orally to pregnant female
Sprague-Dawley rats on days 6 through 15 of gestation. Mo gross
teratogenic effects were noted in the fetuses but both maternal and
fetal toxicity was associated with TCDD at high doses (8.0ttg/kg/day).
