During the November study (Reference 1), one brown darter was collected
from station SF-2 which is very close to the headwaters of Rocky Creek. Re-
peated collections in this same area have failed to produce any other spec-
imens of brown darter. This single collection of the brown darter is the
only specimen which has been taken above range road 201 on Rocky Creek. The
next closest collection of the brown darter was obtained from an area on
Rocky Creek between range roads 200 and 201.
On Rocky Creek there are a few road beds with raised culverts, causing
small impoundments, which may prevent a further northward invasion of the
brown darter on Rocky Creek. Work is currently being done to monitor the
streams invaded by the brown darter to evaluate the apparent threat to the
continued existence of the Okaloosa darter. Also, study areas have been
identified by the Okaloosa Darter Recovery Team for determination of the
population densities, critical macro- and microhabitat, life history, and
effective land management techniques to insure the continued existence of
the Okaloosa darter on the Tiglln Reservation.
