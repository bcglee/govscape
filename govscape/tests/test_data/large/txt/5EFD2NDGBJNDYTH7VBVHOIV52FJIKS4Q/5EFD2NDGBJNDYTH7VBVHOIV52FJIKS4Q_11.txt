SliCTTON 1 I
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A diversity index study of the fish populations of streams draining
various test areas within the Eglin AFB Reservation was conducted from May
to July 1976. Sampling stations were the same as those used in an earlier
baseline study conducted during November and December 1975 (Reference 1),
except for stations If) and 23 which were changed to alternate sites because
of the ease of accessibility of the new sites and the increased fish pop-
u..ation. The times scheduled for collection of specimens were dictated by
range accessibility due to mission requirements and the other scheduled
activities of AFATL personnel.
T'ish populations of the streams were sampled with a small mesh seine,
and all specimens (except [jthcpstpma okaloosae Fowler) were fixed in 10 per-
cent formalin immediately after capture, held in tap water for 24 hours, and
preserved in 40 percent isopropanol. All specimens were Identified to genus
and species (References 2 and 3) and catalogued for placement in the APATL
fish reference collection.
I'hotographs of each sairpling station were taken for use in environmental
documentation and for use as a basis of comparing stream conditions during
future studies (Figures 1 to 25).
During this study, many of the streams sampled were within the territory
of the Okaloosa darter (Etheostoma okaloosae Fowler), ;m endangered species.
All Okaloosa darter specimens were identified in the field and returned to
the stream. Kxtrcme caution was used to avoid Injury to the specimens and
to minimize habitat disruption.
The mean species diversity (d) indices were determined by the formula
presented by Lloyd, Zar, and Karr:
where C is 3.321928 (converts base 10 log to base 2), N is the total number
ooff iinnddiivviidduuaallss, and n. is the total number of individuals in the jth species
(Reference 4).
