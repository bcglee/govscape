20 ABSTRACT (Continue on rnvrrsf airtr If nacea<;Hry and Identify hy block numh^r)
A baseline study of fishes was conducted in streams draining various test
ranges currently used for testing and evaluation of conventional munitions.
The purpose of the effort was to determine a species diversity index for each
of the streams to be used for comparison data in future studies and for use in
environmental documentation. Twenty-three species of fishes and one lamprey
species were collected or observed. All specimens were preserved fexcept
Etheostoma okaloosac Fowler) and catalogued for placement in the Air Force
