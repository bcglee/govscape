SECTION III
RESULTS
The resulting diversity indices for the fish species collected during
this study are given in Table 1. No comparisons between the previous winter
studies (Reference 1) and these summer studies were made because of the
difficulties in interpreting extraneous variables such as the high water
conditions of the streams due to heavy rainfall during the winter months of
1975 and the resulting differences in physical and chemical characteristics
among the various streams.
Twenty-three species of fishes and one lamprey species were collected or
observed during this study (Table 2). One of the fish species, the Okaloosa
darter (Etheostoma okaloosae Fowler), is on the endangered list. One hundred
und fifteen Okaloosa darters were observed in the field, and all specimens
were released unharmed.
The sailfin shiner (Notropis hypselopterus Gunter) was the most abundant
species encountered. Also, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis Baird and
Girg.rd), blackbanded darter (Percina nigrofasciata Agassiz), brown darter
(Etheostoma edwini Hubbs and Cannon), speckled madtom (Noturus leptacanthus
Jordan), and spotted sunfish (Lepomis punctatus Valenciennes) were abundant
in most of the streams studied. A list of species collected from each sta-
tion is given in Appendix A.
