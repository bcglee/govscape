SECTION IV
DISCUSSION
During this study the water level of the creeks was low. This was quite
different from water conditions during a similar study clone in November and
December 1975 (Reference I) when the water level was very high because of
heavy rainfall during the last half of that year. The creeks had returned
to or were below normal level at the time this survey was initiated which
could possibly account for the large increase in the number of species
collected.
During this study 115 Okaloosa darters were observed and released. The
Oknloosa darter was placed on the list of endangered species in 1973 because
of the concern over possible habitat disruption and apparent competition
from the brown darter (Etheostoma edwini, Ilubbs and Cannon). The Okaloosa
darter is endemic to Okaioosa and Walton counties, and its known range is
limited to six streams surrounding Valparaiso and Niccville, Florida, which
drain into Toms, Boggy, and Kocky Bayous. The majority of the range of the
Okaloosa darter is located on the Egl.in Reservation except for a small amount
of privately owned acreage in the Valparaiso and Niceville areas. Most of
the range of the Okaloosa darter at Eglin is undeveloped with the exception
of a few cleared test areas (TA C-74, TA C-74L, and TA C-72) and a few
bridges scattered over various range roads. Even in the test areas which
have been cleared of vegetation, the Okaloosa darter appears to be doing
well and has been observed in large numbers. Many range roads crossing
Okaloosa darter streams have raised culverts overlaid with clay, and in
many instances this produces back water causing small impoundments. These
small impounded areas have a reduced water flow, but many Okaloosa darters
nave been observed from around the culverts of these areas. The most serious
problem facing the Okaloosa darter on the Eglin Reservation appears to be
competition from its closest relative, the brown darter. In recent years
the brown darter has invaded the territory of the Okaloosa darter on Rocky
and Swift Creeks. Dr. Mettee (Reference 5) stated that the brown and Okaloosa
darters could be ecological equivalents, and the competition and possible
hybridization could be detrimental to the Okaloosa darter. Observations
during this and other recent field studies indicate that a reduction in the
ratio of Okaloosa darters to brown darters may occur when an Okaloosa
darter territory is invaded by brown darters. During this study the only
brown darter collections in the territory of the Okaloosa darter were on
Hickory Branch. Collections on Hickory Branch during November 1975 (Ref-
erence 1) produced 5 Okaloosa darters and 3 brown darters while collections
during this study produced 9 Okaloosa darters and 23 brown darters. It has
been postulated (Refercnc3 6) that, given a situation where only a limited
amount of preferred habitat is available to both species, one species might
outcompcte the other due to shortage of food or space, or a combination of
both. This might provide the explanation for the population reversal men-
tioned above since Hickory Branch provides a very limited area of habitat
suitable for either of these species.
