INTRODUCTION
Since November 1974, Air Force Armament Laboratory (AFATL) personnel
have been engaged in an effort to establish the existing site characteristics
for the following Eglin AFB Test areas: TA B-70, TA B-71, TA C-64, TA C-64A,
TA C-74, TA C-74L, TA C-72, TA C-52N, TA C-52C, and TA C-52A. These test
areas are utilized for the testing of conventional munitions. This effort
was initiated to meet the Council of Environmental Quality (CEOJ guide-
lines and Air Force regulation requirements to establish the existing site
characteristics of these tesx: areas for environmental documentation.
Many streams originate on, flow through, or otherwise drain these test
areas; therefore, an essential component of any site description is aquatic
baseline data. For this reason, the study reported here was conducted.
Ideally, the aquatic baseline would have encompassed both the aquatic ver-
tebrates and invertebrates, but the lack of qualified personnel limited the
study to the ichthyofauns.. The aquatic baseline study was to be accomplished
on a four-season basis, but the time required to accomplish the overall
program and the other scheduled activities of AFATL personnel restricted the
study to the winter and summer seasons. The winter study was conducted
during November and December 1975, and the data were published in AFATL-TR-
76-4 (Reference 1).
The approach to this study was to establish the species diversity indices
of streams draining the tost areas previously mentioned, for use in com-
paring the resulting species diversity indices of future studies on the same
test areas. For locations and descriptions of these test areas and sampling
stations, refer to AFATL-TR-76-4. All identification of species was done by
personnel of the Environmental Research Facility. All specimens were pre-
served (except Etheostoma okaJoosae Fowler) and catalogued and will remain
at the Environmental Research Facility, Building 574, as a permanent ref-
erence collection of these test areas.
