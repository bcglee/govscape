Wetlands in Agricultural Landscapes
Mass retention was significantly greater (P < 0.05) during
the summer than during the winter for all variables except
FC. Denitrification rates measured using the acetylene
block method have shown denitrification to be a minor
removal mechanism (<1%) for nitrogen in this wetland. The
mass balance indicated that settling and increased storage
was the largest removal mechanism. The treatment of
wastewater in this wetland did not meet design outflow
concentration criteria, most likely due to BOD sub(5)
overloading.
