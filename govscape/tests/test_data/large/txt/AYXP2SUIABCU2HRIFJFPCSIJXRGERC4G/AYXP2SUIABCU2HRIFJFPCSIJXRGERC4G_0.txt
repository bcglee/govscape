Plant Fact Sheet
DEERTONGUE height. Deertongue produces short, strong rhizomes.
Two seed crops are produced annually: an early crop
Dichanthelium clandestinum on an open terminal panicle and a later crop in a
panicle enclosed in the swollen leaf sheath. The
(L.) Gould
second crop, produced in the enclosed panicle,
Plant Symbol = DICL produces an abundance of seed. Deertongue has
about 400,000 seeds per pound. Deertongue lodges
over winter and forms a mat of vegetative cover.

leaf sheaths of the old stems.
Adaptation and Distribution
The natural distribution is Nova Scotia, Quebec, and
Maine to Kansas, south to northern Florida and
Texas. Deertongue is widely scattered throughout
this area volunteering onto denuded sites. It grows
well on non-cultivated soil. Because of its tolerance
to low pH, high concentrations of aluminum, and
droughty infertile conditions, it is commonly found to
volunteer on such sites.
