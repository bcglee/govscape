desirable method. Where this is not possible, wood
fiber mulch should be used at 1,500 pounds per acre.
Deertongue is most often planted in mixtures with
other warm season grasses such as switchgrass with
the total rate of 12-15 pounds per acre. Typically,
deertongue does not exceed 3 pounds of the per-acre
mix.
Management
In lieu of a soil test, two tons of lime and 300 to 400
pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer per acre are suggested
for deertongue plantings on critical areas. Where
conditions permit, these materials should be worked
into the soil surface during site preparation.
Additional fertilizer applications may be needed after
a stand has emerged in order to develop a vigorous
plant cover. Once good cover has developed, plant
vigor will be maintained without additional fertilizer
treatments. It can be mowed (1-2 times per year) if
necessary to improve appearance.
Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and
area of origin)
‘Tioga’ (northeast US) is the only variety of
deertongue. It was developed by the Big Flats Plant
Materials Center and released for commercial
production in 1975. Seed is available from
commercial sources.
