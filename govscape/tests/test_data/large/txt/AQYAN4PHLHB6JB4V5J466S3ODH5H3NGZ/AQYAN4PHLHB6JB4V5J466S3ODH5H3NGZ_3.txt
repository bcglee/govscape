Dodonaea viscosa (‘a’ali’i, lampuaye, Florida hopbush): A widely
adapted indigenous shrub that is native to Hawaii and naturalized
in the Northern Marianas. It is a good windbreak, hedge, and
screen plant. It is mostly seen growing to a height of approximately
10 feet, but can reach 25 feet under certain conditions. It has a
moderate growth rate. It is propagated by seed and its attractive
seed capsules make colorful leis. We have formally released a
selection collected on Molokai referred to as Kamiloloa
Germplasm ‘A’ali’i Source Identified Class of Natural Germplasm
(pictured). A fact sheet on ‘a’ali’i may be viewed at:
