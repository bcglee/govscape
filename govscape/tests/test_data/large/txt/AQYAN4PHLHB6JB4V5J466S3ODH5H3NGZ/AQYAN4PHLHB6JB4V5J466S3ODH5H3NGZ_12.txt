Vetiveria zizanioides, syn. Chrysopogon zizanioides (‘Sunshine’
vetivergrass): This tall bunch grass from Sunshine, Louisiana is
sterile. Its main use is as a vegetative barrier (FOTG Practice Code
601), but it is used in many other ways for controlling erosion and
improving water quality. It is planted as vegetative barriers on
American Samoa, Guam, Saipan, and Maui. The photo shows it
stabilizing a waterway on Oahu. Vetiver is native to India. It has a
strong root system that contains an essential oil used in making
perfume. The World Bank has promoted the use of vetiver for
erosion control in developing countries. Propagation is by plantlets
or slips produced by dividing the crown of a mature plant.
According to the ARS Germplasm Resources Information Network
(GRIN), the genus Vetiveria has been changed to Chrysopogon.
