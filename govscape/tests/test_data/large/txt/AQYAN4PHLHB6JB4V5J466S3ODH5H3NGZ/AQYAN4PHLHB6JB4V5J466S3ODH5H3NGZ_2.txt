Crotalaria juncea (‘Tropic Sun’ sunn hemp): Sunn hemp is an
erect, annual legume that grows well throughout the Pacific Islands
Area. The cultivar Tropic Sun is an excellent cover/green manure
crop and is resistant to root-knot and reniform nematodes. The
photo shows a crop being mowed prior to soil incorporation at 55
days after planting. It is popular with farmers for soil improvement
and nematode control. It is also used as a short term windbreak.
The PMC has seed available of Tropic Sun for demonstration type
field plantings and seed increase plantings. A fact sheet on Tropic
Sun can be found on the following Web site:
