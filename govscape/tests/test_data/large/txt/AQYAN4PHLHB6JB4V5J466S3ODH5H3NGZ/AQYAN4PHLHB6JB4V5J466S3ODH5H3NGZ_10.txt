Polyscias guilfoylei (panax, tanitani): Native to Polynesia, panax is
used as a space economizing wind barrier/hedge. An accession at
the PMC (pictured) has attained a maximum height of a little over
28 feet. Its growth habit is similar to ‘Tropic Coral’ tall erythrina
which is being devastated by the erythrina gall wasp. A 2/16/06
update on the erythrina gall wasp can be seen at:

Like ‘Tropic Coral’, panax is easily propagated by stem cuttings,
but its growth rate is about half that of ‘Tropic Coral’. A Risk
Assessment/fact sheet on panax can be seen at:
