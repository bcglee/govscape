Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia, quick stick, madre de cacao,
rechesengel): Gliricidia is a fast growing leguminous tree that
grows approximately 30 feet tall and 30 feet wide. It is used for
windbreak, forage, and shade for crops such as cacao and coffee.
To maintain a compact, hedge type windbreak, it would require
trimming as it gets somewhat rangy at maturity. The trimmings can
be used for mulch and green manure. It is propagated by seeds and
cuttings. The cuttings root easily which is why one of its common
names is quick stick. A Risk Assessment/fact sheet is at the
following Web site:
