Arachis pintoi (perennial peanut, forage peanut): This
perennial peanut is a creeping, low growing legume native to
Brazil. It makes a dense cover for erosion control and
beautification. On Kauai, it looks good as a conservation cover
in papayas. It has bright yellow flowers much of the time.
Cultivars of Arachis pintoi are Golden Glory, Amarillo,
Forrajero, and others from CIAT in South America. It is
susceptible to attack by spider mites which can cause yellowing
of the leaves at times. Propagation is by seed. A fact sheet on
perennial peanut can be found on the University of Hawaii
