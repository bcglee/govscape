Sporobolus virginicus (seashore rushgrass, ‘aki’aki, totoput,): An
indigenous, creeping, perennial grass that is propagated by
rhizomes. It is native to sandy, usually coastal, sites in tropical and
subtropical areas worldwide. It is usually found just above the
high-tide mark. It will grow up to 1,000 feet in elevation, but the
soil must be fairly loose for the rhizomes to spread. It is
performing well for erosion control on Kaho’olawe where ripping
or chiseling was done to fracture the hard soil. It is drought tolerant
and very salt tolerant and should be useful for shoreline, stream
bank, and critical area stabilization. It is palatable to animals and
can be grazed. There is a vigorous strain on the beach near
Garapan, Saipan. The most promising accession in Hawaii (HA-
4846) was collected from Papohaku Beach on the west end of
Molokai. A fact sheet may be seen at the following Web site:
