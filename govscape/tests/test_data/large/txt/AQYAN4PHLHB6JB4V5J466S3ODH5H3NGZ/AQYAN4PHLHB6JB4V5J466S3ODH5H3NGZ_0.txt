PLANTS FOR FIELD AND INCREASE
PLANTINGS
March 1, 2006
This report includes a summary of non-invasive, promising species
for field plantings. It serves as a guide to Field Office personnel
when considering plants for new field and increase plantings.
The basic job of the Plant Materials Program is to assemble, test,
and release plants for conservation use. Proven plants are jointly
released by the NRCS, University of Hawaii, and other institutions.
Plant materials of formally released plants are provided to growers
for the increase or commercial production of the released plants.
Data collected from field plantings are used to document the
release of new cultivars. The field planting is the final phase of
testing in the plant materials systematic testing process. It is where
a new plant is tested on a farm or other site under actual use
conditions. Field plantings may also be used to gather additional
information on previously released and commercially available
plants and to demonstrate a new plant, technique or practice.
Information gained from field plantings is incorporated into the
Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) to make it more useful.
Field and increase plantings are conducted though Field Offices.
Field Office personnel may request a field or increase planting of
the plants in this report by contacting Bob Joy, Plant Materials
Specialist (PMS), via phone at: (808) 567-6868 extension 109 or
via e-mail at: Robert.J.Joy@hi.usda.gov. After the PM-9 form is
completed by the Field Office Planner, Bob will verify with Glenn
Sakamoto, Plant Materials Center (PMC) Manager, that the plant
materials are available. Glenn or one of the PMC staff will contact
the Field Office regarding shipping. Plant materials are free, but
supplies are limited and plantings should be relatively small.
