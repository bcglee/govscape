Heteropogon contortus (piligrass, tanglehead): Piligrass is
indigenous to the Pacific Islands Area and is widely distributed in
the tropics and subtropics. The native Hawaiians used it to thatch
their houses and other buildings in dry areas. It is a drought
tolerant bunch grass that is currently being used for erosion control
and restoration on Kaho’olawe. It is also used for landscaping. The
piligrass pictured was collected on Kaho’olawe and was formally
released as Kaho’olawe Germplasm Piligrass Source Identified
Class of Natural Germplasm. It is propagated by seed. Interesting
additional information on piligrass can be found on the
Kamehameha Schools’ Web site with its associated links at:
