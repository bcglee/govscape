Eragrostis variabilis (kawelu,’emoloa, lovegrass): A perennial
bunchgrass that is endemic to Hawaii. It is an attractive grass that
is found on all the main islands and in the Northwestern Hawaiian
Islands. It occurs on coastal dunes and grasslands, open sites in dry
forests, and on exposed cliffs up to approximately 3,600 feet. It
shows promise for erosion control on critical areas, restoration,
wildlife, and beautification. It may be somewhat short lived. It is
propagated by seed. Because it is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands,
it should be planted only there. The kawelu pictured was collected
on Kaho’olawe and was formally released as Kaho’olawe
Germplasm Kawelu Source Identified Class of Natural
Germplasm. An interesting article on its restoration and wildlife
value is at the following Web site:
