Musa sp. (‘Dwarf Brazilian’ banana): This cultivar was named
Santa Catarina Prata in Brazil and is a delicious dessert banana that
has enough wind tolerance to be used as an herbaceous wind
barrier. It was brought to Hawaii from Brazil in 1979 by Dr. Leng
Chia of the University of Hawaii. We began testing it because of
requests from Pacific Islands Area farmers for multipurpose
windbreaks. The University of Guam has evaluated it as a
firebreak. It has performed well wherever it has been planted in the
Pacific Islands Area. The bananas are well accepted in the retail
and wholesale food markets where it is sometimes, erroneously,
referred to as dwarf apple banana. Propagation is by corms.
