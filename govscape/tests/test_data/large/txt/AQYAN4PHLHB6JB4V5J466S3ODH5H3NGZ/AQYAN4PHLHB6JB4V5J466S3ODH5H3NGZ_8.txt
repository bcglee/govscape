Paspalum hieronymii (‘Tropic Lalo’ paspalum): The cultivar
Tropic Lalo is widely adapted. It is a perennial, creeping grass that
forms a dense cover. The photo shows it mowed (left) and un-
mowed (right) with a bare strip in the middle. It is tolerant of
traffic and is low maintenance. It may be planted to grass
waterways, terraces, farm roads, lawns, and used as a permanent
cover in orchards. It produces very little seed so propagation is by
stolons. Tropic Lalo has become a standard recommendation for
erosion control in Hawaii and, therefore, field plantings are
warranted only for special applications. The PMC will provide
small amounts for growers to increase their own planting material
for conservation plantings if material isn’t available commercially.
Other islands in the Pacific Islands Area are in need of more field
plantings to determine its range of adaptability. A fact sheet on
Tropic Lalo can be found on the PMC Web page under ‘Tropic
Lalo’ Paspalum:
