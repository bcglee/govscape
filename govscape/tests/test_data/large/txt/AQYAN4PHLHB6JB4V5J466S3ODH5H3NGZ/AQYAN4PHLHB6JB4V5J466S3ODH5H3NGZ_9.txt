Pennisetum purpureum (hybrid Napiergrass, hybrid elephantgrass):
Napier hybrids and hybrids of Napier and pearl millet are sterile
and not invasive. ‘Mott’ (pictured) is a hybrid Napier cultivar that
was released by the University of Florida. It is very leafy and
makes good forage for cut and carry or grazing. A PMC developed
hybrid (HA-5690) is a cross between bannagrass, a tall Napier, and
a male sterile pearl millet. HA-5690 performed well on a slope
planting using the live fascine technique. A Napier x pearl millet
hybrid called PMN Hybrid was developed by the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters’ Association for the USDA-ARS Georgia Coastal Plain
Experiment Station. It has thinner stems than other Napier. These
tall grasses have promise for herbaceous wind barriers, vegetative
barriers, and forage. Propagation is by stem cuttings planted in
furrows, similar to sugar cane. Additional information is at:
