Known active resistance mechanisms in oats
 Oats do have Type 2 resistance to pathogen spreading
(infection across the pedicel has not been observed,
Langevin et al. 2004)
 Oats appear to have tolerance to trichothecenes from F.
graminearum (Langevin et al. 2004; our observations)
 Oats may have Type 1 resistance against initial infection or
in kernels (toxins can be removed by dehulling)
 Limited diversity in resistance
