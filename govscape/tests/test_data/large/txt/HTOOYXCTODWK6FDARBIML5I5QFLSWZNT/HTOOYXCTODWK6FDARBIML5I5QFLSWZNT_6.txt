Possible measures of Fusarium infection in oats.
 Fusarium Head Blight (Type 1 -2)
 Fusarium infected kernels: Freezer blotter test (Type 1-2)
– 100 harvested seeds imbibed and frozen on filter paper.
Medium heritability.
 Damaged kernels, spikelet sterility, yield effects (Type 5)
– Has not been adequately investigated (but next talk)
– Finland: ”highest toxin contents in small grain”
 Mycotoxin determinations: Relationship between kernel
infection and toxin level unclear
