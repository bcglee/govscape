Cultivar differences in oats: a varied picture
world wide – and in this meeting
 Late cultivars more affected (Finland, Russia)
 Hull-less better than hulled
 Tall cultivars – no clear trends
 Cultivar differences do exist, especially some very bad ones
 Russia: Gavrilova et al, abstract V-*: screened 100 accessions
from the VIR collection, a wide variation
 Canada (Yan’s poster): Cultivar differences, ’Robust’ vs. ’CDC
Dancer’
 Canada (Mitchell-Fletch’s poster): Accessions better than this
 Norway: Cv. ’Bessin’ most susceptible, ’Belinda’ much better
