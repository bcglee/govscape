USF&WS lack the personnel, facilities and
expertise to produce seedlings for their woodcock

Thus, US F &WS personnel opted to solicit PMC
assistance with production of the speckled alder
seedlings. The PMC agreed to produce
approximately 1000 seedlings for the Canaan

speckled alder seeds provided by the US F&WS in
the autumn of 2005. This project is expected to
continue through 2008.
