What We Do
The Plant Materials Center serves Appalachia by
evaluating plants for their ability to solve specific
conservation problems related to climate, the
rugged topography, soil limitations, various land
uses, fish and wildlife needs and desires of the
landowners. The center provides a place for
conducting systematic observations and evaluations
of plants needed to protect our natural resources.
New techniques are developed for the propagation,
establishment, management and use for new or
improved species of grasses, legumes, shrubs and
trees.
