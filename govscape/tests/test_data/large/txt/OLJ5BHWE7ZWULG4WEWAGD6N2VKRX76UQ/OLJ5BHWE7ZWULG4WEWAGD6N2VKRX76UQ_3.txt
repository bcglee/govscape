frequently 1n two leg vessels 1n the Ranch Hand group. These determinations
were made only by palpation, a relatively crude technique that can be affected
by obesity, edema, and similar factors. Measurement by a more sophisticated
technique allowing quantification (Doppler) will be accomplished at the next
scheduled examination to determine whether this pulse difference actually
exists or 1s due to artifact.

No difference was found 1n the objective psychological tests, e.g.,
IQ. Some differences of uncertain clinical significance were noted 1n subjec-
tive measurements, particularly 1n the high-school educated portion of the
examinees.
3. We believe the study measured the true health status of both the Ranch
Hand and comparison Individuals to the extent medical science permits. The
study repeatedly demonstrated the effects of classical risk factors (smoking,
age, alc6hbl, etc.) to the same extent in both groups. Such demonstration of
these effects reassures us that we would also have demonstrated a significant
herbicide or contaminant exposure effect 1f it were present at this time. We
consider the study reassuring 1n that no cases of conditions previously at-
tributed to exposure were found, there was no increased Incidence of major
clinical health problems in Ranch Handers, and both the Ranch Handers and
comparisons appeared in good general health for their age.
