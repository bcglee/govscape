DRAFT
RANCH HAND MORBIDITY REPORT
1. The A1r Force study of the health status of Individuals exposed to
Herbicide Orange and D1ox1n during the Ranch Hand Operation 1n Vietnam was
released on 24 February 1984. Over 1,000 Ranch Hand members completed the
questionnaires and physical examination. Their results were compared with a
carefully selected group of Individuals who also served in Southeast Asia but
were not exposed to Herbicide Orange or D1ox1n. Copies of the press release
and executive summary of the report are attached.
2. Important findings of Interest include the following:
a. Conditions which have been attributed to exposure.
No cases of soft tissue sarcoma (a form of cancer), porphyrla cutanea
tarda (a Hver disorder), or chloracne (a skin condition) were found 1n any
Ranch Hander, Various investigators have previously reported herbicide or
dloxln exposure caused these specific conditions.
b. Cancer
There was no difference in occurrence of systemic cancer. Some types
of systemic cancer were found only in comparison subjects. (See Attachment 1.)
Skin cancer, of the type that can be completely cured by simple excision
(basal cell carcinoma), was seen more frequently in Ranch Handers. However,
1t was not possible to determine sun exposure history 1n either group. Sun
exposure 1s recognized as a leading cause of such cancers. Necessary data on
sun exposure will be obtained at the scheduled follow-up examinations,
c. Fertility/Infertility
There were no differences 1n fertility/Infertility Indices,
miscarriages, stillbirths, live birth rates, sperm amount and type, frequency
