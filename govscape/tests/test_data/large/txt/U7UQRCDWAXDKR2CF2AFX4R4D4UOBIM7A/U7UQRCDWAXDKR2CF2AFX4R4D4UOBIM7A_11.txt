Ecological Barriers to Insect Establishment
Principal Investigator: Bob Nowierski, professor,
Montana State University Department of Entomology.
Project Description: The primary goal of this multi-
faceted project is identifying ecological factors that may
influence or impede the establishment of Aphthonaflea bee-
tles. In short, it examines an extremely important question:
Why do flea beetles establish and provide good leafy spurge
control at some release sites but not at others? Five potential-
ly limiting factors will be evaluated in an attempt to provide
some answers:
• Flea beetle/leafy spurge habitat associations: This effort
to better define preferred, or requisite, habitat characteristics
for Aphthona spp. includes studies of soil micro- and macro-
nutrients, physical/chemical soil properties, chemical prop-
erties of spurge foliage and roots, plant productivity and the
relationship, if any, of these factors to Aphthonaspp. estab-
lishment and impact. Providing a more precise definition for
preferred habitats would reduce some of the guess work
involved with making biocontrol releases and thus increase
the potential for establishing a successful release site.
• Genetic variation of leafy spurge: It has long been sus-
pected that the genetic variability of leafy spurge may be a
factor in Aphthona spp.establishment. Two studies are now
underway to examine this potential limitation. The first
involves studies of leafy spurge grown in greenhouse condi-
tions from spurge seeds and/or root-stock collected at field
sites. The plants will then be exposed to flea beetles, with
their performance to be monitored.
In the second study, modern molecular genetics tech-
niques will be used to reconstruct the invasion and post-colo-
nization history of leafy spurge. North American and
European leafy spurge accessions are available for this study,
and homologous DNA variants of known sequence will pro-
vide the phylogenetic information. By correlating the results
of this study with the first, we will be able to identify insect-
resistant biotypes throughout the North American range of
leafy spurge.
