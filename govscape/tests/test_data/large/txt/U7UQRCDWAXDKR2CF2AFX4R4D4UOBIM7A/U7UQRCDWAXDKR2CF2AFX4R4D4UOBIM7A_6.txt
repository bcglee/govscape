Supporting Research & Demonstrations
Insect &Pathogen Syngery
Principal Investigator: Tony Caesar, research plant
pathologist, USDA-ARS Northern Plains Agricultural
Research Laboratory.
Project Description: This project is targeted at research-
ing relationships between biocontrol insects and naturally
occurring soil-borne pathogens. Tony’s theory is simple:
Insects create a wound in the root, which allows the
pathogen(s) to enter the plant and cause disease. Past
research in controlled situations has documented dramatic
acceleration of spurge mortality when both insects and
pathogens have been present, and successful insect release
sites are often found to be infected with soil-borne
pathogens. “We have evidence showing that sites where
insects make a high impact generally have one or more
soil-born pathogens present,” he said. “We now need to
look at sites where insects establish but fail to make an
impact. Are there enough pathogens present? Are they vir-
ulent enough? There is a lot of unexplored territory we
need to look at.”
In addition to the synergistic relationship between bio-
control insects and plant pathogens, Tony is also research-
ing the genetic propensity for pathogens to react with
