planning and conducting an “in the field, hands-on” train-

technical expertise for insect sampling and release meth-

Assessment & Inventory
Extensive assessment and inventory work was complet-
ed at four areas in North and South Dakota, Montana and
Wyoming. The intent of the assessment and inventory work
was to develop consistent, comparable baseline data for
each site. The data will be used to determine the effective-
ness of control strategies demonstrated at the various sites,
