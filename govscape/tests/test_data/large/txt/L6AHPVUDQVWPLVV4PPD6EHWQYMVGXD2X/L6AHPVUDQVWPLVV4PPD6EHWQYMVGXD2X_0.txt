partial funding from the US Geological Survey and
the US National Biological Information Impact/Vectors: Ligustrum sinense is native to China
Infrastructure and was introduced into the United States in 1852 for
use as an ornamental shrub. It is used for hedge and
mass plantings, and sometimes as single specimens
for its foliage and its profusion of small white flowers
(Dirr 1990; Wyman 1973). It continues to be widely
sold in the nursery and gardening industry. The
foliage of Chinese privet is also used, presumably,
for cut-flower arrangements. This horticultural
introduction has been cultivated for a relatively long
time in the United States. Wyman (1973) reports that
this species is still growing as a hedge on the old
Berkman’s Nursery grounds in Augusta, Georgia,
where it was planted in the early 1860’s. It was
planted on the Chickamauga and Chattanooga
National Military Park after it came under the control
of the Secretary of War in 1890. Present day plants
are descendants of those early plantings (Faulkner et
al. 1989). According to Small (1933), the species
was escaping from cultivation in southern Louisiana
by the 1930’s. A survey of appropriate herbaria
reveals collection records from Georgia as early as
1900. Based on herbarium records the species has
become naturalized and widespread in the southeast
and eastern U.S. during the 1950’s, 60’s, and 70’s.
Taylor et al. (1996) notes the rapid, recent spread of
Ligustrum sinense in Oklahoma.
