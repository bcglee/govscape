converted into spectral radiance (L ), using the equation: L = Gain x DN + Bias, where Gain
b b
and Bias were extracted from the image header files from the satellite data provider. The top-of-
the-atmosphere reflectance (ρ ) was calculated for each pixel in the image using the procedure
TOA
outlined in Chander and Markham (2003). In this procedure, the ρ for each pixel was
TOA
calculated by dividing spectral radiance by the incoming energy (radiance) in the same short-
wave band. The incoming radiance is a function of mean solar exo-atmospheric irradiance, solar
incidence angle, and square of the relative earth-to-sun distance (Thenkabail, 2003). The ρ
SUR
was computed after applying atmospheric interference corrections for short-wave absorption and
scattering using narrow band transmittance calibrated for each band with the MODTRAN, a
radiative transfer model (Berk et al., 2003).
The LAI-SVI relationships were evaluated using ordinary least square regression analysis with
measured LAI as the independent variable. A set of SVIs evaluated to develop LAI-SVI
statistical relationships included difference indices, sum indices, product indices, ratio indices,
and normalized difference indices. The least square regression models used to evaluate each of
the SVIs were linear, exponential, power, and quadratic. Finally, the most significant models
were identified and reported for the study area. The cutoff R2 value of 0.75 was used to identify
the most significant models.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
LAI measurements were made in 16 commercial fields that planted to corn, 11 fields each to
cotton and sorghum, and 8 fields to soybean, respectively. The measured LAI values varied from
0.09 to 6.21 m2 m-2 with a standard deviation of 1.91 m2 m-2. High variability in the LAI
measurements was due to presence of different crops at different growth stages.
Table 2 presents a set of significant LAI-SVI models and associated R2, adjusted R2, root mean
square error (RMSE), and F statistic for major summer crops in the Panhandle of Texas.
Adjusted R2 measures the improvement in the performance of the model by adding another
independent variable to the least square regression model.
Seven out of 13 reported models (Table 2) use either SR (R43=TM band 4/ TM band 3) or NDVI
i.e. normalized difference of TM bands 4 and 3. The remaining models use SVI that derived
using either TM band 3 (R) or 4 (NIR) in combination with other TM bands such as 1, 2 or 7.
This indicates that the R and NIR bandwidths are sensitive to the LAI and is consistent with
previous reports (Thenkabail et al., 1994; Huete et al., 1994; Walthall et al., 2004). Chlorophyll
pigments in plant leaf absorb energy in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum resulting in
relatively low red reflectance and transmittance while lignin in plant cell walls cause scattering
of near-infrared energy resulting in relatively high near-infrared reflectance and transmittance
(Gates et al., 1965).
Based on the RMSE and F statistic, exponential and power models (Table 2) based on the
normalized difference between the TM bands 4 and 3 were found to be the best models for
estimating LAI. The power model that uses NDVI43 accounted for 84 percent of the variability
in the measured LAI data with a relatively small RMSE of 0.50.
