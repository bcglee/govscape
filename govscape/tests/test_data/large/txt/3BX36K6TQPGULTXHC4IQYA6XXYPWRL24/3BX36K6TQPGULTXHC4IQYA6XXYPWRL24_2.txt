These studies and others have shown that there is a strong contrasting relationship between
spectral reflectance measurements of canopy cover in red and infrared wavelengths.
Consequently, a simple ratio (SR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil
adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) (Huete et al., 1994) are the three most commonly used SVIs to
estimate LAI. All three use ratios of red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance: SR = NIR/R;
NDVI = (NIR-R)/(NIR+R) and SAVI = (1+L) (NIR â€“ R)/(NIR+R+L) where L is a coefficient
introduced to reduce variation in background (soil and crop residue) reflectance and its value
varies from 0 to 1. However, these indices are not sensitive at LAI values greater than 3.0 m2 m-
2. The normalized difference water index (NDWI; Anderson et al., 2004) uses normalized
difference between NIR and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance and the green index (GI;
Gitleson et al., 2003) that uses green in place of red reflectance appear to be remain sensitive for
LAI values between 3.0 and 6.0 (Walthall et al., 2004). The GI is given as: GI = (NIR / G)-1
where G is the spectral reflectance in green wavelength. Most of LAI-SVI statistical
relationships reported in the literature are based on ordinary least square regression (SAS Institute
Inc., 2003) and follow one or more of the following models: (1) linear; LAI = a + bX; (2)
X
exponential; LAI = a eb ; (3) power or logarithmic; LAI = aXb ; and quadratic; LAI = aX2 +bX+ c;
where, X is either SVIs or reflectance/raw digital number derived from remote sensing data.
While satellite remote sensing based SVIs have been used for mapping and monitoring LAI, the
strengths and transferability of empirical LAI-SVI relationships to other regions may potentially
be affected by exogenous factors such as sun-surface sensor geometry, background reflectance,
and atmosphere-induced variations on canopy reflectance (Turner et al., 1999; Chen and Cihlar,
1996; Jacquemond et al., 1995; Meyer et al., 1993). There have been few tests to compensate for
exogenous effects factors on LAI-SVI relationships and results are mixed. Further, most studies
in the past considered one vegetation type. Moreover, comparisons across studies have been
limited by differences in sensor characteristics and image processing methods (Turner et al.,
1999).
Overall, canopy cover reflectance is a multiple function of many variables that are different over
time and space. Therefore, it may not be a viable option to develop a single SVI-based LAI
model for one region and apply it to different regions. Further, spectrally based LAI models for
agricultural crops in semi-arid regions are scarce and, currently, there are no such models
available for the Texas Panhandle. Development of region-specific SVI indices will minimize
errors in estimating LAI for use in as input to groundwater (to predict evapotranspiration),
agronomic, ecological and climatic models. The main objective of this study is to develop a set
of Landsat TM-based SVIs to estimate LAI for major agricultural crops in the Texas Panhandle.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study Area: This study was conducted with LAI data collected from 48 commercially operated
farms (24 each in Ochiltree and Moore counties) in the Texas Panhandle underlain by the
Ogallala aquifer (Fig. 1), which is being depleted by excessive pumping for irrigation. Moore
County is in the north-central part of the Panhandle and has a total area of 236,826 ha. Two-
thirds of the land is in the nearly level, smooth uplands of the High Plains (USDA-SCS, 1975)
and most of it under row crop production. Corn, sorghum, cotton and soybean are the major
summer crops in both Ochiltree and Moore counties. In 2004, it ranked fifth in corn production
in Texas and accounted for about 5.7 percent of total corn produced in the state (NASS, 2005).
