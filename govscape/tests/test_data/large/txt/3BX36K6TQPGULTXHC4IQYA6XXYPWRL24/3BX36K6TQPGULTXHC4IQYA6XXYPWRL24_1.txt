INTRODUCTION
Leaf area index (LAI) is a measure of foliage density that plays a major role in photosynthesis,
groundwater-surface water interactions through evapotranspiration (ET) (Sumner and Jacobs,
2004), atmospheric gas exchange (Burkart et al., 2004), nutrient uptake (Leonard et al., 1987)
and crop productivity (Thenkabail et al., 1994). Obviously, it is one of the sensitive input
parameters to plant growth, atmospheric circulation (Sellers et al., 1997; Ruimy et al., 1994),
energy balance (Bonan, 1995), and water quality simulation models (Gowda et al., 1999) at field
to landscape to global scales. Accurate estimates of LAI are also useful in estimating soil water
content from microwave remote sensing data by subtracting the effects of crop water content on
reflectance (Anderson et al., 2004).
Traditional in-situ techniques to measure LAI involve destructive sampling of leaves and are
time intensive. However, in recent years, numerous indirect in-situ methods have been developed
to measure LAI including the scanner method (Yang et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2005), electronic
leaf area meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge1, UK; Rouphael and Colla, 2005) and LAI-
2000, Plant Canopy Analyzer1 (Welles and Norman, 1991). Although these in-situ techniques
can be accurate, it is not practical to use them to monitor LAI spatially and temporally over large
geographic areas. One approach is to employ satellite remote sensing techniques to estimate LAI.
The use of satellite data is a practical alternative to in-situ measurements, provided that suitable
spectral vegetation indices (SVI) can be developed.
In the last three decades, numerous SVIs have been developed to estimate LAI from Landsat
Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) (Wiegand et al., 1979 for winter wheat), Thematic Mapper (TM)
(Thenkabail et al., 1994 for corn and soybean) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
(Xavier and Vettorazzi, 2004 for mixed crops mainly sugarcane; Walthall et al., 2004 for corn
and soybean) sensors. Table 1 presents spatial and spectral resolutions of the Landsat 5 TM data.
