CONCLUSIONS
Leaf area index (LAI) is important for spatially distributed modeling of surface energy balance,
evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity. The Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM)-based
spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were evaluated using the ordinary least regression technique
for their ability to estimate LAI for major crops in the Panhandle of Texas. A set of most
significant SVI-LAI models was identified. The R2 values for the selected models varied from
0.76 to 0.84 with the power model based on the NDVI producing the best agreement with field-
measured LAI. Analysis of the results indicated that SR and NDVI were sensitive to LAI, which
is consistent with the literature. Overall, the remote sensing approach is promising for the rapid
collection of LAI information on individual fields over large areas in the Northern High Plains of
Texas in a time and cost-effective manner.
