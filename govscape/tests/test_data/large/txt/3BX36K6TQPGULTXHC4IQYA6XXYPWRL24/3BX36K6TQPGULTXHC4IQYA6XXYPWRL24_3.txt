The area of Ochiltree County is 234,911 ha with more than 45 percent of the land in 2004 under
row crop production. In 2004, the Ochiltree County ranked eighth in Texas for sorghum
production and accounted for about 2.4 percent of the total sorghum produced in the state
(NASS, 2005). Annual average precipitation is about 481 and 562 mm for Moore and Ochiltree
counties, respectively. Crop water needs are supplemented with groundwater from the
underlying Ogallala aquifer. Nearly level to gently sloping fields with clay loam soils of the
Sherm series occupy nearly all of the crop land in both Moore and Ochiltree counties.
Field Data Collection: Two Landsat TM scenes were acquired, one on June 27, 2005 for
Ochiltree County and the other on July 4, 2005 for Moore County, for developing the Landsat
TM-based LAI models. Developing the LAI models consist of three steps: 1) ground-truth data
collection, 2) atmospheric correction of Landsat TM imagery for deriving surface reflectance
values for ground-truth location, and 3) development of SVI-LAI statistical relationships using
the ordinary least square technique. On the day of the Landsat 5 satellite overpass, ground-truth
data were collected from 48 randomly selected commercial fields (24 each in Ochiltree and
Moore counties) in the study area. Ground-truth data included geographic coordinates using a
handheld Global Positioning System (GARMIN GPSMAP 76, Garmin Ltd), plant type and
density, width of plant rows and extraction of one representative plant for LAI measurement in
the laboratory. The LAI was measured using the electronic leaf area meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd,
Cambridge, UK; Rouphael and Colla, 2005).

Each pixel in the Landsat 5 image has a spatial resolution of 30 m after resampling. Ground truth
pixel locations on the image were identified using the GPS coordinates. For model development,
mean reflectance data from 9-pixels (ground-truth pixel and surrounding 8 pixels) were used, as
it was difficult to precisely identify the ground truth location in the field. Atmospherically
corrected surface reflectance (ρ ) for each TM band was used to develop SVIs. As a first step

to compute ρ , the digital numbers in each TM band image except thermal band 6 were
