Abstract: Mapping and monitoring leaf area index (LAI) is important for spatially distributed
modeling of surface energy balance, evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity. Remote sensing
can facilitate the rapid collection of LAI information on individual fields over large areas in a time and cost-
effective manner. However, there are no LAI models available for the major summer crops in the Texas
Panhandle. The main objective of this study was to develop statistical relationship between LAI and
Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) based spectral vegetation indices (SVI) for major crops in the Texas
Panhandle. LAI was measured in 48 randomly selected commercial fields in Moore and Ochiltree
counties. Data collection was made to coincide with Landsat 5 satellite overpasses on the study area.
Numerous derivations of SVIs were examined for estimating LAI using ordinary least square
regression models such as linear, quadratic, power and exponential models. The R2 values for the
selected models varied from 0.76 to 0.84 with the power function model based on the normalized
difference between TM bands 4 and 3 (NDVI) producing the best results. Analysis of the results
indicated that the SVI-LAI models based on the simple ratio i.e. the ratio of TM bands 4 and 3, and
NDVI are most sensitive to LAI.
