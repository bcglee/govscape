stock change, there may be differences in information needs, such as for carbon reporting.
Carbon accounting requirements may specify tracking carbon harvested in one or more years and
reporting carbon sequestered at one or more later years. For example, one may be interested in
tracking products associated with a particular year or may be interested in the cumulative effects
of successive harvests. Alternatively, an accounting method that focuses on the long-term
effects of current rates of harvest and processing on future stocks of carbon in harvested wood
products requires estimates of carbon in use or in landfills at 100 years after harvest (Miner, in
press). Thus, all of our projection tables extend through 100 years.
Consideration of imports or exports of harvested wood can complicate the calculations. The
effect of considering the movement of harvested wood or wood products over boundaries
depends on the approach used to account for carbon. Basic carbon accounting approaches, as
presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Penman and others 2003) are:
stock-change, atmospheric-flow, and production. The accounting method presented here is a
production approach: the disposition of carbon is estimated for all wood produced, including
exports. Imports are excluded from accounting under the production approach. Currently, the
IPCC does not provide guidelines on accounting methods for trade in harvested carbon.
However, the additional information required to account for imports or exports is essentially the
disposition, as described in this document, for the specific quantities of carbon imported or
exported. A possible default assumption is that the disposition of carbon in exported wood is
identical to that of carbon in products retained in the United States.
Primary wood products. Primary wood products such as lumber, plywood, panels, and paper are
the products of mills; they provide a product-based starting point for calculating the disposition
of carbon in harvested wood products (Fig. 1.3). Specific primary products are identified in
Table 1.7. Manufacturing or construction incorporates these primary products into end-use
products such as houses, furniture, and paper. Each end-use product has an expected lifespan,
and after use the primary products may be recovered for additional use, burned, or otherwise
disposed of. After disposal, carbon in products is allocated to disposal pools, which ultimately
leads to long-term storage in landfills or to emission to the atmosphere. Thus, the disposition of
primary wood products are modeled through partitioning and residence times of a succession of
intermediate pools to the final disposition categories as defined in Table 1.1.
Table 1.7 includes factors for converting primary wood products into total mass of carbon. For
example, 1000 ft2 of â…œ-inch softwood plywood averages 0.236 tonne of carbon. Tables 1.8 and
1.9 indicate the fraction of each primary product that remains in use or in landfills, respectively,
for a given number of years after harvest and production, with the assumption that harvest and
production are at time zero. The tables represent national averages. Table 1.8 lists the fraction
of each primary product remaining in an end use product for up to 100 years after harvest and
processing. For example, column 2 of Table 1.8 indicates that after 10 years, 77.7 percent of
softwood lumber remains in an end-use product; end uses include residential or other
construction, furniture, and wood containers. The change in carbon between the initial quantity
of primary products and the amount specified in later years in Table 1.8 represents products
taken out of use; these are then either sequestered in landfills or emitted to the atmosphere.
Table 1.9 includes an estimate of carbon sequestered in landfills. In the example of softwood
