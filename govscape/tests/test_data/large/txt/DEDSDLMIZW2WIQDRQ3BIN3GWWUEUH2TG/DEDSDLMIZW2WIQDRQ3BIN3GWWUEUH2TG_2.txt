the area in a way that is compatible with the format of the look-up tables. The average carbon
estimates per area in the look-up tables must be multiplied by the area or, as appropriate,
harvested volumes, to obtain estimates in total carbon stock or change in carbon stock.
The estimates in the look-up tables are called “average estimates,” indicating that they should be
used when it is impractical to use more resource-intensive methods to characterize forest carbon,
that is, particularly when more specific information is not available. Because these tables
represent averages over large areas, the actual carbon stocks and flows for specific forests, or
projects, may differ. The look-up tables should not be used when conditions for a project or site
differ greatly from the classifications specified for the tables. Some users may require an
alternative to an “all-or-nothing” use of the tables because they may have some information and
need to use the tables to supplement, or fill in gaps, in carbon stocks. Alternatively, users may
require slight alterations to the tabular data provided. Therefore, we also include the underlying
assumptions and appropriate citations so that the tables can be adjusted to data availability and
information requirements of individual activities.
The accuracy of estimates from look-up tables will depend on how well the estimates in the
tables represent the specific conditions of the land area or stratum for which estimates are
required. In general, application of a regional estimate from a look-up table to a specific tract of
land will get a rating of “C” to reflect the level of uncertainty inherent in this approach.
However, a close match between the characteristics of the specific land area and the land
characteristics defined by a look-up table could result in a higher rating. The following
tabulation illustrates how look-up tables may be rated under the 1605(b) reporting system. This
is intended as a guide to rating – individual circumstances must be carefully considered before
conducting such an accuracy assessment.
