An important consideration is the accounting of ingrowth and mortality when estimating change
in biomass stocks. Not understanding where, when and how to include these components can
lead to erroneous estimates of changes in aboveground biomass. The approach taken depends on
whether permanent or temporary plots are being used. For permanent plots, the method is based
on tracking individual surviving trees (see Box 3.4) while for temporary plots the estimation is of
the pool of biomass at time 1 and time 2. For permanent plots there is no requirement to track
tree mortality but there must be an estimate of trees growing into the plots (i.e. exceeding the
minimum measurement size only at time 2). For an accurate estimate using temporary plots both
ingrowth and mortality should be included but due to the nature of temporary plots it is normally
not possible to determine the date of a mortality event or which trees had passed the minimum
measurement boundary during the census interval.
Time: t t

AGB: 10 12 13 12 15.2 7
Permanent Plot:
Stand Increment = (Σ Increments of surviving trees) + (Σ Increment(s) of ingrowth)
= ((12 - 10) + (15.2 - 12)) + (7 - 4)
= (2 + 3.2) + (3)
= 8.2
Temporary Plot:
Stand Increment = (ΣAGB at t - ΣAGB at t )

= ((12 + 15.2 + 7) – (10 + 12 + 13))
= (34.2 – 35)

Figure 3.5. An illustration of the methods of calculating change in aboveground biomass stocks for
permanent plots and temporary plots. AGB = aboveground biomass of live trees; AGB of a minimum-sized
tree is set arbitrarily to 4 units (based on Clark et al. 2001).
Figure 3.5 shows a hypothetical example of the same trees being measured with the temporary
plot and the permanent plot method (almost invariably temporary plots would be in different
locations at time 1 and time 2 but for ease of illustration the exact location is remeasured). The
change in biomass stock for ingrowth trees is the biomass of the new tree at time 2 minus the
minimum biomass required for a tree to be measured.
