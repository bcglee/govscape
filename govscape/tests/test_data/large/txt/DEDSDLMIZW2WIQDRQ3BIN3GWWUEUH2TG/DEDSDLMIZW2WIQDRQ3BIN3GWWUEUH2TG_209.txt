Part 1: The carbon mass of roundwood can be determined using the volume. The product of
volume of roundwood and specific gravity (from Tables 1.4 or D8) is mass; 50 percent of this is
carbon mass. Based on specific gravity from Table 1.4, total carbon for this example is:
= 10,000 × 0.518 × 0.5 = 2,590 t
Part 2: The allocation of roundwood logs to primary wood products according to region and
category are provided in Table D6. The fractions of primary products remaining in use or in
landfills at a given year are provided in Tables 1.8 and 1.9, respectively. The fraction of emitted
carbon associated with energy recapture is from Table D7. The calculations for hardwood saw
logs from the Northeast at 15 years are:
Fraction of carbon in products in use (summed products from Table D6 and Table 1.8)
= (0 × 0.698) + (0.492 × 0.456) + (0 × 0.724) + (0 × 0.799) + ((0.005 + 0.022) × 0.647)
+ (0.038 × 0.420) + (0.058 × 0.040)
= 0 + 0.224 + 0 + 0 + 0.017 + 0.016 + 0.002 = 0.260
Fraction of carbon in landfills (summed products from Table D6 and Table 1.9)
= (0 × 0.187) + (0.492 × 0.334) + (0 × 0.171) + (0 × 0.124) + ((0.005 + 0.022) × 0.218)
+ (0.038 × 0.357) + (0.058 × 0.253)
= 0 + 0.164 + 0 + 0 + 0.006 + 0.014 + 0.015 = 0.198
Fraction of carbon emitted by year 15 (one minus the fractions in use or in landfills)
= 1 – 0.260 – 0.198 = 0.542
Fraction of carbon emitted with energy recapture (from Table D7)
0.5953
= 0.542 × 0.6143 × exp(-((15/6812) )) = 0.324
Fraction of carbon emitted without energy recapture
= 0.542 – 0.324 = 0.218
These fractions allocate the disposition of carbon at year 15 after harvest for hardwood
saw logs in the Northeast (see Table 1.6).
Part 3: The application of the factors from Table 1.6 (calculated in Step 2) to carbon in
roundwood (calculated in Step 1) determines the disposition of carbon at year 15, which is:
In use = 0.260 × 2,590 = 673 t
Landfills = 0.198 × 2,590 = 513 t
Emitted with energy = 0.324 × 2,590 = 839 t
Emitted without energy = 0.218 × 2,590 = 565 t
Forest Ecosystems
Wood in trees in a forest is often characterized according to the total volume of merchantable
wood. Merchantable volume can be expressed per unit of forest area; in this case, we use the
volume of growing stock of live trees as defined by the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory
and Analysis Data Base (FIADB; Alerich and others 2005). Merchantable volume must be
linked to amount of roundwood carbon to calculate the expected disposition of carbon in
harvested wood products (as described above for roundwood and primary wood products).
