How much of the change in mean soil carbon can be reliably reported will depend on the
resolution permitted by the monitoring framework. Sampling intensity (i.e. number of soil
samples) and frequency must be taken into consideration when attempting to resolve changes in
soil carbon over time. Resolution in quantifying the minimum change between two means with
a given level of confidence can be expressed as the percent of the absolute difference between
the means. A targeted resolution (e.g. 80% of the absolute difference between the means), or
alternatively, a targeted magnitude of change in soil carbon (not to exceed the absolute
difference between the mean estimates), can be achieved by adjusting sampling intensity,
sampling frequency, or a combination of both.
Increasing sampling intensity serves to reduce standard error around mean estimates separated in
time, and better distinguish change that takes place (Figure 3.2). As high levels of variability in
carbon among sample units are typical of soils (often ~ 30% C.V.), high sampling intensity is
consequently required to discern change.

The resolution of change detection also depends on the magnitude of the change itself, and as
this is time dependent, it is appropriate to consider frequency of sampling. Increasing the
interval between sampling events should increase the magnitude of the change that takes place,
which, where variance around the means is constant, increases the percentage and magnitude of
the change resolved (Figure 3.3). This is an important consideration, in that small changes
expected with short sampling intervals may be undetectable, even with high sampling intensity.
Required sample size (for a targeted % absolute difference between the means or targeted
magnitude of change) is thus a function of (1) inherent variability (which can be mitigated for via
stratification or reduced by composite sampling), (2) magnitude of change expected (thus
sampling interval and assumed rate of soil C accumulation), and (3) desired confidence level.
Sample size can be estimated by adapting the commonly used Minimum Detectable Difference
calculation (Zar, 1996) to solve for sample size for a targeted difference in means, once a sample
interval has been chosen.
