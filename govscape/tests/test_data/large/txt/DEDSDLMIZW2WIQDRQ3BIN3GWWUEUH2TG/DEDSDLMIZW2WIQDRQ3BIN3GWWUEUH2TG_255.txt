Box 3.5. Calculating biomass from stand volume data
Example 1: An oak-hickory forest in Wisconsin with a growing stock volume of 180 m3/ha.
A. Direct Method
Smith et al. (2003) list the following coefficients for calculating aboveground biomass (AGB) of
oak-hickory in the Northern Lake States:
F = 307.5 G = 0.0748 H = 186.9
Therefore AGB = F x (G + (1 – exp(-volume/H)))
= 307.5 x (0.0748 + (1 – exp(-180/186.9)))
= 213.1 t/ha
B. BEF Method
As growing stock volume is < 200 m3/ha we must calculate the BEF. Oak-hickory is a hardwood
forest type.
Therefore BEF = exp(1.912 – (0.344 x ln GSV))
= exp(1.912 – (0.344 x ln(180)))
= 1.134
Therefore AGB = GSV x BEF
= 180 x 1.134
= 204.1 t/ha
Example 2: A loblolly pine plantation in Georgia with a growing stock volume of 120 m3/ha.
A. Direct Method
Smith et al. (2003) list the following coefficients for calculating aboveground biomass (AGB) of
planted pine in the South East States:
F = 187.3 G = 0.0662 H = 184.9
Therefore AGB = F x (G + (1 – exp(-volume/H)))
= 187.3 x (0.0662 + (1 – exp(-120/184.9)))
= 101.8 t/ha
B. BEF Method
As growing stock volume is > 100 m3/ha and the forest type is pine the BEF is 0.81 t/m3.
Therefore AGB = GSV x BEF
= 180 x 0.81
= 97.2 t/ha
