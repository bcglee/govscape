3.5.1.2 Activities on forested lands
Forest management involves alternating periods of harvest and regrowth, and as such carbon
stocks in forest biomass vary over time (Figure 3.7). In addition, changes in management
practices can result in increased carbon storage through a variety of ways, such as: changing the
timing or intensity of harvest, reducing damage to the residual stand through more efficient
logging practices, switching from clear-cut harvesting to selective-cut harvesting, or by creating
or widening riparian buffer zones.

management and (bottom) selective harvest of a similar forest.
Initially it is important to consider what carbon pools are important in forest management
activities. Clearly live vegetation, dead wood, and wood products are central. With the examples
in Figure 3.7, the amount of dead wood increases over time with subsequent harvest. The
amount of dead wood that accumulates through time is a function of the amount of slash left
behind and the rate of decomposition of that slashâ€”the larger the amount of slash and the slower
