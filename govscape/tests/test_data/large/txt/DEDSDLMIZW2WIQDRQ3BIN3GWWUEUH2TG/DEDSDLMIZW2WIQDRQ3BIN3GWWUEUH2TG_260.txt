classifying the dead wood into its correct density class and then adequately sampling a sufficient
number of logs in each class to represent the wood densities present. It is advisable to sample at
least 10 logs or more of each different density class. In forests with unique plant forms, like
early successional species and palms as in tropical forests, it is also advisable to treat these as
separate groups and sample them the same way as well.
The simplest method to estimate dead wood density would be to have a value for the proportion
of undecomposed density that each of the three decomposition classes represents. Estimates of
undecomposed wood densities are widely available in the literature (e.g. forestry handbooks).
This initial density value multiplied by the decomposition proportion by the volume gives
biomass. Heath and Chojnacky (2001) calculated the proportions as 90% (sound), 70%
(intermediate) and 40% (rotten) for forests in the northeast USA. These proportions could be
used, but test samples to check the validity of these default data would be very important.
For forest areas with few species and where the rate of decomposition of wood is well known for
given species or forest types, simple decomposition models could be locally developed for
estimating the density of the dead wood at different stages of decomposition (Beets et al. 1999).
Volume of wood would still need to be estimated based on either method 1 or 2 above, but the
density could be estimated based on the model of decomposition.
Rates of decomposition across regions and forest types are given (Table 3.6). Where the age of a
piece of dead wood is known, current density can be calculated from decomposition rate, then
the biomass can be calculated from volume.
An example of a dead wood calculation is given in Box 3.6.
