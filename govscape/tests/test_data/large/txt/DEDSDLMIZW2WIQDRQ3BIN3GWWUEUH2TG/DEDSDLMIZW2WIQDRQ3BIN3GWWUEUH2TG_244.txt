Figure 3.4. Schematic diagram of nested, fixed area circular sample plots. Saplings could be measured in the
smallest circular plot (about 1 m radius), trees between 2.5 and 50 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) could
be measured in the medium circular plot (about 10 to 14 m radius depending on stem density), trees above 50
cm dbh could be measured in the largest circular plot (about 20 m radius), and understory and fine litter
could be measured in the four small plots located in each quadrant of the sample area. The radius and
diameter limits for each circular plot would be a function of local conditions and expected size of the trees
through time.
Plots are extrapolated to full hectare area to produce carbon stock estimates. Extrapolation by use
of expansion factors occurs by calculating the proportion of a hectare that is occupied by a given
plot. As an example, if a series of nested circles measuring 4 m, 14 m and 20 m in radius were
used, their areas are equal to 50 m2, 616 m2 and 1,257 m2 respectively. The expansion factors for
converting the plot data to a hectare basis are 198.9 for the smallest, 16.2 for the intermediate
and 8.0 for the largest nested circular plot.
Time and effort spent in field measurement depends both on sample size (number of plots) and
plot area. While increasing sample size increases precision, increasing plot area decreases
variability between samples roughly following the relationship derived by Freese (1962) (see
Table 3.1),
CV 2 = CV 2 * √(P / P )
2 1 1 2
where “CV” is the coefficient of variation and “P” is plot area. Thus, by increasing plot area,
variation between plots is reduced, which allows for a smaller sample size while achieving the
same precision level. For example, pilot studies could provide an estimate of the CV and plot
area (e. g. from FIA plots-see Box 3.3.), then a CV could be selected to achieve the desired
precision given cost considerations. Substitution of these values into the above equation will
provide an estimate of the plot area needed for optimum sampling.
