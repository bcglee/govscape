Appendix D
Detailed Information on Development and Use of Tables for Calculating Carbon in
Harvested Wood Products (Tables 1.4 through 1.9)
This appendix features detailed information on the source of coefficients for Tables 1.4 through
1.9. This will help users in adapting carbon calculations to specific needs. Information is
organized by the three starting points: primary wood products (Tables D1 through D5),
roundwood (principally Tables D6 and D7), and forest ecosystems (principally Tables D8
through D12).
The choice of starting points depends on the available wood products information. For example,
a landowner may want to know potential carbon sequestration for a given area of forest. This is
addressed by the principally land-based estimate that starts from a measure of trees in a forest,
specifically growing-stock volume. Alternatively, a measure of wood removed at harvest, such
as logs transported to mills for processing, volume or mass of industrial roundwood, is another
starting point. Finally, a starting point with relatively precise information is based on quantities
of primary wood products. These latter two starting points can be considered product-based.
Data on roundwood and primary products are often available as State-level or regional statistics.
The methods for these three starting points will result in identical core results, if consistent data
are available corresponding to the starting points. This is because estimates of the disposition—
or fate—of carbon in products over time are based on likely uses and longevity of primary wood
products. Thus, the data and assumptions on primary wood products serve as the model for the
disposition of carbon over time. These data and assumptions are discussed below in the section
on primary wood products. All additional calculations associated with the other two starting
points (roundwood or forest ecosystem) are based on linking inputs to the disposition of these
primary wood products. If roundwood is the starting point, or input quantity, then the disposition
of carbon is calculated by linking carbon in roundwood to the separate primary wood product
classifications. Similarly, volume of merchantable wood in forests is linked to quantities of
roundwood before calculating the disposition of carbon over time. These links can include some
additional output estimates which are not associated with all three starting points, such as the
fraction of emitted carbon associated with energy recapture. Data and assumptions used to link
the different inputs to a common quantity of harvested wood are presented below in the section
on roundwood and the section on forest ecosystem.
Primary Wood Products
Primary wood products are the initial results of processing at mills; examples of primary
products include lumber, panels, and paper. These primary products are usually incorporated
into end-use products with the long-term disposition of carbon classified as remaining in use, in
landfills, or emitted to the atmosphere following burning or decomposition. Calculations are in
three parts: 1) converting quantity of primary product to quantity of carbon, 2) determining the
fraction of carbon in primary product in use as a function of time since production, and 3)
determining the fraction of carbon in primary product in landfills as a function of time since
