For bulk density determination, dry the samples in an oven at 105 oC for a minimum of 48 hours.
And if the soil contains coarse rocky fragments, retain the coarse fragments, weighed them and
record their weights.
For soil carbon determination, the material is sieved through a 2 mm sieve and the material is
then thoroughly mixed. The dry combustion method using a controlled-temperature furnace (e.g.
LECO CHN-2000 or equivalent) is the recommended method for determining total carbon in the
soil (Nelson and Sommers 1996). Where carbonate minerals may be present, a new dry
combustion method using the LECO RC-412 multi-carbon analyzer is the preferred method.
Both organic and inorganic forms of carbon can be measured on the same mineral soil sample in
one analytical run. An alternative is to remove any carbonates through acid treatment before
hand.
As an alternative to the multi-carbon analyzer, the dichromate oxidation method with heating is
acceptable for measuring organic C (Nelson and Sommers 1996) and the pressure calcimeter
method is acceptable for determining soil carbonates (Sherrod et al. 2002). The classic Walkley-
Black method is not acceptable for determining organic C in soil because of incomplete wet
combustion and other inaccuracies. Additional details about the multi-carbon analyzer and other
carbon analysis methods can be found in the FIA Lab Methods Manual (Amacher et al. 2003).
The bulk density of the mineral soil core is calculated by:
ρ =ODW
b
CV − (RF/PD)
Where:
ρ = Bulk density of the < 2mm fraction, in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3)
b
ODW = Oven dry mass of fine fraction (<2 mm) in grams
CV = Core volume in cm3
RF = Mass of coarse fragments (> 2 mm) in grams
PD = Density of rock fragments in g/cm3. This is often given as 2.65 g/cm3, though the
actual value may be determined by submerging a known mass of coarse fragments in a known
volume of water; the displacement gives an estimate of rock volume, which can then be used to
calculate density.
The bulk density and carbon concentration data are used to compute amounts of carbon per unit
area.
For the mineral soil, amounts of C per unit area are given by:
C (t/ha) =[(soil bulk density,(g/cm3)×soil depth(cm)×% C)]×100
