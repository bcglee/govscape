Box 3.6. Calculating biomass density of dead wood.
In the following example dead wood is sampled along 100 m of line (line-intersect method) to
determine the biomass stock. Diameters and density classes are recorded and a sub-sample
collected to determine density in each of the three density classes (sound, intermediate and
rotten). The following numbers represent the hypothetical results:
13.8 cm sound
10.7 cm sound
18.2 cm sound
10.2 cm intermediate
11.9 cm intermediate
56.0 cm rotten
Densities of subsamples: Sound: 0.43 t/m3
Intermediate: 0.34 t/m3
Rotten: 0.19 t/m3
Volume of sound wood: π 2 x [d12 + d22…..dn2/8L]
π 2 x [13.82 + 10.72 + 18.22/800]
7.85 m3/ha
Volume of intermediate wood: π 2 x [10.22 + 11.92/800]
3.03 m3/ha
Volume of rotten wood: π 2 x [56.02/800]
38.7 m3/ha
Biomass stock = (7.85 x 0.43) + (3.03 + 0.34) + (38.7 x 0.19) = 11.8 t/ha
Standing dead wood can be measured as part of the tree inventory. Standing dead trees should
be measured according to the same criteria as live trees. However, the measurements that are
taken and the data that are recorded vary slightly from live trees. For example, if the standing
dead tree contains branches and twigs and resembles a live tree (except for leaves) this would be
indicated on the field data records. From the measurement of its dbh, its biomass can be
estimated using the appropriate biomass regression equation as for live trees, subtracting out the
biomass of leaves (about 2-3 % of aboveground biomass). However, a dead tree can contain
only small and large branches, or only large branches, or no branches – these conditions need to
be recorded in the field measurements. Branches need to be classified in proportion to the size of
the standing dead tree so that the total biomass can be reduced accordingly to account for less of
the dead tree remaining. When a tree has no branches and is just the bole, then its volume can be
estimated from measurements of its basal diameter, height, and an estimate of its top diameter;
