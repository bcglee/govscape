Table 1.10.—Confidence intervals for the estimates of carbon density for live and standing dead trees at the 50th and 99th percentiles of volume. The
percentiles reflect the distribution of stand-level volume in survey data for the conterminous United States.a The 95-percent intervals about the
expected carbon density are represented as the percentage of the carbon density; thus, the interval is ± the percentage.
