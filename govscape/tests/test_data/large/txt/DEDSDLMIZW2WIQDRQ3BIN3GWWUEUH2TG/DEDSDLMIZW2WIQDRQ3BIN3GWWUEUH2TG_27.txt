Example 1.6 – Calculate stocks of carbon in harvested wood products based on having
primary wood products data such as products from a mill
Given the information on softwood lumber and softwood plywood produced from 2000 to 2003
(in the following tabulation) we use Tables 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 to calculate: 1) carbon in the primary
products, 2) the accumulation of carbon stocks over a period of 4 years, and 3) total carbon
stocks after 100 years. Note that Tables 1.8 and 1.9 provide the fraction of primary product
remaining for a given number of years after processing; this example assumes that harvest and
processing are at the beginning of each year (2000-2003) and estimates for the amount remaining
apply to the end of each year. This is an application of calculating the disposition of carbon in
harvested wood based on quantities of primary wood products, as described in Figure 1.3.
Step 1: Determine initial carbon stocks for two primary products based on given quantities
produced each year over the 4-year period by using factors from Table 1.7. For example, 93,000
MBF softwood lumber × 0.443 = 41,199 t carbon.
The initial carbon stocks for two primary products, softwood lumber and softwood plywood:
Quantity of primary product Carbon stock

2000 93,000 183,000 41,199 43,188
2001 85,000 175,000 37,655 41,300
2002 95,000 170,000 42,085 40,120
2003 100,000 173,000 44,300 40,828
Step 2: Calculate carbon stocks in end uses and landfills for each product for each year after
production for the period 2000-2003 based on inputs of wood harvested and processed in each
year. Use Tables 1.8 and 1.9 to determine stocks for each year since processing. Note that each
of the 20 intermediate values in the following tabulation is based on the sum of carbon
contributed from softwood lumber and softwood plywood. For example, the carbon stocks of
primary products produced in 2001 are 37,655 t of softwood lumber and 41,300 t of softwood
plywood. From this, a total of 3,820 t are in landfills at the end of 2003 (after 3 years). The
quantity is calculated as: 3,820 t = (37,655 × 0.051) + (41,300 × 0.046).
