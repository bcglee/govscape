The BEF is significantly related to the GSV for most forest types, generally starting high at low
volumes then declining at an exponential rate to a constant low value at high volumes. Thus
using one value for the BEF for all values of GSV is incorrect. This general relationship has been
found to apply to many forests of the world, including tropical forests (Brown 1997) and forests
in China (Fang et al. 1998)
Schroeder et al. (1997) and Brown and Schroeder (1999) provide methods to calculate the BEF
(t/m3) for all forest types and regions across the eastern US.
Hardwoods: BEF = exp(1.912 – (0.344 x ln GSV))
If GSV > 200 m3/ha use a constant BEF of 1.
Spruce-Fir: BEF = exp(1.771 - (0.339 x ln GSV))
If GSV > 160 m3/ha use a constant BEF of 1.
Pines: GSV < 10 m3/ha BEF = 1.68 t/m3
GSV 10 – 100 m3/ha BEF = 0.95 t/m3
GSV > 100 m3/ha BEF = 0.81 t/m3
Where GSV = growing stock volume in m3/ha.
An example of using both the direct and the BEF methods to calculate biomass for two forest
types is found in Box 3.5. The two methods differ by less than 5 % for both forest types and thus
can be considered as giving equivalent results. Thus, the user may select either method.
