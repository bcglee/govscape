As illustrated in Figure 1.2, most of the relationships between columns of the tables are
nonlinear. As a consequence, small errors are possible when interpolating between two points,
such as in the volume to tree carbon pairs. However, these errors likely will be minimal. The
nonlinearity can produce more significant errors if the tables are applied to aggregate summaries
of large forest areas, that is, substantially greater than 10,000 ha (Smith and others 2003). As a
result, it is best to apply the tables to relatively smaller forest areas versus calculating large
aggregate volume and area.
1.4.2 Harvested Wood Carbon
The basic information required for calculating the disposition of carbon in harvested wood
products based on each of the three starting points (Fig. 1.3) are in Tables 1.4 through 1.9. The
purpose of this section is to provide sufficient background so that a user can apply these tables.
However, some users may want to modify the estimates to incorporate alternate data or
assumptions, so we also provide background data and detailed explanations in Appendix D of
how these tables are generated.
Methods for calculating the disposition of carbon in harvested wood and the starting points for
making such calculations are organized according to the diagram in Figure 1.3. These starting
points, which correspond to possible sources of data (independent variables) are: 1) the volume
of wood in a forest available for harvest and subsequent processing (for example, growing-stock
volumes in Tables 1.2 and 1.3); 2) roundwood harvest from a forest in the form of saw logs and
pulpwood, which is a measure of wood available for processing at mills; and 3) primary wood
products, that is products produced at mills, such as lumber, panels, or paper. We discuss
methods and application of each of these, beginning with estimates based on primary wood
products as inputs.
The model that allocates carbon over time since harvest is the same for all three starting points,
and this model is based on primary wood products (see Appendix D for details). Thus, the
disposition is a function of primary wood product and time. Any of the additional calculations
necessary for the “upstream” (on Figure 1.3) starting points are essentially required to translate
input carbon stocks to primary wood product equivalents. Conversely, calculations at
“downstream” starting points do not quantify all pools of harvested carbon. For example, a
portion of the wood harvested from a forest ecosystem is processed into primary wood products,
but carbon in other biomass remains on site as logging residue or is removed from site as
fuelwood or what ultimately becomes waste in the production of primary products. Thus,
identifying pools such as fuelwood is necessary for starting from the forest ecosystem to partition
carbon and obtain the quantity going to primary products. Quantifying fuelwood is not possible,
and unnecessary, for starting from data on a quantity of primary wood products.
Before applying the forest ecosystem tables, users should identify: 1) the approach most
appropriate for the data available, and 2) the type of summary values or results that are
appropriate to the carbon accounting method and the forest carbon project. Each starting point
requires slightly different input data and each accounts for somewhat different pools of carbon.
Compatibility between available data and the appropriate starting point depends on identifying
these differences. In addition to having different starting points to compute carbon stocks or
