However, simple soil corers have been found to work in many soils, particularly in the deeper
soils of the central and southern regions of the US. Shallow soil pits to 30 cm or so also work
well and have been shown to be a cost-efficient method. The impact-driven soil coring tool is
not very practical for collecting deep cores, and it is not practical nor cost efficient to use a truck
or trailer-mounted hydraulically-driven soil coring tool in most forest areas.
Composite sampling is an effective means to reduce inter-sample variability. This is done by
aggregating a pre-determined number of samples (2-4 samples) from each collection site in the
field, from which one sample is derived for analysis. The resulting composite sample captures
more of the range of inter-microsite variability in soil carbon.
3.4.4.1 Sampling the mineral soil
Soil chemical concentrations are generally measured in air-dried soils, while bulk density
measurements must be made on oven-dried soils. It is often easiest to take separate sets of cores
for the bulk density and carbon determination because the sample preparation for each differs
somewhat. In addition, fewer cores may be needed to accurately estimate bulk density because it
is generally less variable than soil chemical properties.
Using the core sampler method, mineral soil samples are collected from within the area of the
sampling frame after the forest floor has been removed. Because the carbon concentration of
forest floor materials is much higher than that of the mineral soil, including even a small amount
of surface organic material can result in a serious overestimation of soil carbon stocks.
Once the soil corer has been inserted into the soil to the desired depth, it must be removed from
the ground by pulling upwards in a smooth vertical motion. The top and bottom (or bottom only
depending upon the coring tool used) of the core should be trimmed even with the rims. When
taking cores for measurements of bulk density, care should be taken to avoid any loss of soil
from the cores; if any material is lost the sample needs to be taken again. All the material in the
corer should be placed into an appropriately labeled sample bags.
The excavation method involves digging a small pit, wide enough to collect the soil to the depth
desired. A hand shovel can be used to collect material to the desired depth, making sure that
sufficient volume of soil from the sides of the pit equal approximately the volume of a soil corer.
It is important that material is collected from the entire depth to avoid biasing the sample.
Uniform rings can be used to sample sides of the pit for bulk density, making sure not to
compress the soil
As with forest floor samples, soil samples can also be sent to a professional lab for analysis.
Experience shows that commercial laboratories exist throughout the country and routinely
analyze plant and soil samples for a variety of measures using standard techniques. It is
recommended that the selected laboratory be checked to make sure that they follow the
commonly accepted standard procedures both with respect to sample preparation (sieving etc.),
drying temperatures, and method for carbon analysis (dry combustion method).
