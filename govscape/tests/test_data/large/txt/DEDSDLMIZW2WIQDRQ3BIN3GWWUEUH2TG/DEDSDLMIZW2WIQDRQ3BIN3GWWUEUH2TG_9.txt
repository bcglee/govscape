format of the tables are based on Birdsey (1996): current stand-level carbon and growth-and-
yield models were compiled as forest carbon yield tables. Forest types correspond to definitions
in the FIADB and represent common productive forests within each region.
The first two columns in each forest ecosystem table represent an age-volume relationship (also
known as a yield curve) based on information from the timber projection model ATLAS (Mills
and Kincaid 1992 with updates for Haynes 2003). ATLAS uses data on timber growth and yield
and FIA data to develop a set of tables of growing-stock volume for projecting large-scale forest
inventories representing U.S. forests for various policy scenarios. The yields (age-volume)
represented in Appendices A, B, and C are broad averages; the basic set is from the appendix
tables in Mills and Zhou (2003). Stand ages included in the tables are from the ATLAS yields,
and these were limited to 90 years in the South and 125 years elsewhere. We assume all age-
volume relationships are based on an average level of planting or stand establishment, that is,
after clearcut harvest (reforestation) or as a part of stand establishment (afforestation).
Additional tables are included for Southern pines and some Pacific Northwest forests to reflect
stands with relatively higher productivity or more intensive management practices (see specific
tables in Appendices A through C). These yields are based on ATLAS and timber projections
prepared for Haynes (2003).
Carbon estimates are derived from the individual carbon-pool estimators in FORCARB2 (Heath
and others 2003, Smith and others 2004a, Smith and Heath 2005). FORCARB2 is essentially a
national empirical simulation and carbon-accounting model that produces stand-level, inventory-
based estimates of carbon stocks for forest ecosystems and regional estimates of carbon in
harvested wood. Estimates of carbon in live and standing dead trees are based on the methods of
Jenkins and others (2003) and Smith and others (2003). A new set of stand level volume-to-
biomass equations was calibrated to the FIADB available on the Internet as of July 29, 2005
(USDA For. Serv. 2005). These are the bases for the carbon values for live and standing dead
trees provided here. However the volume-based estimates of tree carbon from FORCARB2
required minor modification for the tables because many yield curves specify zero volume at
both 0 and 5 years. This produced discontinuities over time in the estimates of tree carbon,
usually in the second and third age classes. Carbon in tree biomass is accruing even if sapling
trees remain below the threshold for classification of growing-stock volume3 but above the
classification size where trees are considered part of the understory. Therefore, tree carbon at the
first row of the table is set to zero, and carbon for year 5 (and occasionally the third age class) is
based on a modification of the volume-based estimates. Briefly, a subset of the FIADB with
younger stands was used to develop age-based regressions with biomass from tree data (Jenkins
and others 2003); these regressions converged with the volume-based estimates, usually by age
10 to 15. We used a ratio of the two estimates to smooth estimates between the second and third
age classes.
Estimates in carbon density in understory vegetation are based on Birdsey (1996); estimates of
carbon density in down dead wood were developed by FORCARB2 simulations. Estimates of
these two pools are based on region, forest type, and live-tree biomass. (For additional
3 The minimum tree size for growing stock is 5 inches d.b.h.; significant tree carbon can accumulate in a stand
before trees reach this threshold.
