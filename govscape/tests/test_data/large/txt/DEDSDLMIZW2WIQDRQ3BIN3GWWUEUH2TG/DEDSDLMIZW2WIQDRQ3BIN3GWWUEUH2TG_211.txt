component equations of Jenkins and others (2003); they are summaries from the FIADB by types
and sizes of stem wood and bark in stands that are likely to be harvested (as described above for
Table 1.4). The product of carbon in roundwood and the bark ratio (from Tables 1.5 or D11) is
carbon in bark on roundwood. Fuelwood is estimated from the ratio of fuelwood to growing-
stock volume that is roundwood (Johnson 2001), which is summarized in Tables 1.5 and D12.
Thus, carbon in fuelwood is the product of carbon in roundwood and the fuelwood ratio (from
Tables 1.5 or D12), and bark on fuelwood is the product of carbon in fuelwood and the bark
ratio.
Ecosystem carbon is removed, emitted, or remains on site at harvest. Thus, total non-soil carbon
at the time of harvest in the Appendix C tables (the harvest scenarios) equals the non-soil carbon
in the corresponding year of the Appendix B tables (afforestation). Similarly, total non-soil
forest ecosystem carbon at the time of harvest in the Appendix C tables (the harvest scenarios)
equals the non-soil carbon at age zero of the Appendix A tables (reforestation). The pools of
carbon in down dead wood and forest floor at the time of harvest reflect logging residue. These
decay over time even as new material accumulates in these pools with stand regrowth (Turner
and others 1995, Johnson 2001, Smith and Heath 2002, Smith and others 2004b). The pool of
carbon removed at harvest is based on regional average values and calculated as described
above. The residual carbon—not on-site or removed—is assigned to the “emitted at harvest”
column in Appendix C. While site disturbance associated with harvest likely results in carbon
emissions, this pool is also likely to include carbon in wood removed but not classified as
roundwood. The use of regional averages to allocate ecosystem and harvested carbon also
suggests that values in the final column (in Appendix C) may be larger or smaller, depending on
actual forests or harvests. The Appendix C tables are examples of how forest carbon stocks can
include carbon in harvested wood; these are not recommendations for rotation length or timing of
harvest.
The use of regional fractions or ratios to allocate carbon for a number of forest types within the
region has potential for occasional extreme or unrealistic values. That is, the sum of carbon in
roundwood, fuelwood, and bark is limited by live tree carbon density. To avoid extreme values,
some limits are set for the use of these regional averages. The fuelwood ratios used for
calculating the fuelwood components of the harvest scenario tables (Appendix C) are averages
by type but not size (that is, columns 3 and 6 in Table D12). We also limit the proportion of live
tree carbon allocated to roundwood plus bark to 66 percent, and the limit for total carbon
removed (roundwood, bark, and fuelwood) is 78 percent of live tree carbon. These limits are
based on generalized tree biomass component equations from Jenkins and others (2003).
Calculated values for carbon removed at harvest (such as for Appendix C) seldom exceed these
limits, but one of the exceptions is included in the example below.
Example calculations of carbon in harvested wood products for Table 1.3 – disposition
from forest ecosystems
This example illustrates the calculations to determine the disposition of carbon in wood products
for the harvest scenario tables in Appendix C. We calculate the disposition of carbon at 15 years
after harvest from a maple-beech-birch forest in the Northeast (see Table 1.3). Most of the
following example can be completed with factors in Tables 1.4 through 1.6 (as opposed to tables
in this section), but it is included here because it illustrates the above discussion.
