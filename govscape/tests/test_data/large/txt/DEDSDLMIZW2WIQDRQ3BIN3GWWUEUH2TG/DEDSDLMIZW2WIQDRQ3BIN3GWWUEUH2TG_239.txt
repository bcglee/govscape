event to the next. For the RME approach (Figure 3.1), the monitoring results from plots are
pooled to derive a mean for the sample population at time “two”, then the 95% confidence
interval is subtracted to establish a minimum estimate of the population mean. Change in soil
carbon is calculated by subtracting the maximum estimate of the population mean at time “one”
(mean at time 1 plus 95% C.I.) from the minimum mean estimate at time “two”. The resulting
difference represents, with 95% confidence, the minimum change in mean soil carbon from time
“one” to time “two” (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1. Illustration of the relationship between the magnitude of the reliable minimum estimate (RME)
between Time 1 and Time 2 sampling periods and the 95% confidence interval (the solid and dashed bars)
around the mean soil carbon content (shaded circle). The confidence interval is a function of the standard
error, which equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. The larger the
sample size, the smaller the standard error and the smaller the 95% confidence interval. Thus, RME1 is
smaller than RME2 because it is based on fewer samples.
This approach of course assumes normality, and soil carbon values are usually normally
distributed. In cases where a data set is shown to be non-normally distributed, for example,
where a number of extreme values positively skew the data, data can be transformed (e.g.
converting values to logarithms), or alternatively dividing up the non-normally distributed data
set a posteriori into normally-distributed subsets (i.e. post stratification). Otherwise, a non-
parametric test (e.g. Kruskal-Wallis), using the median to represent central tendency, may be
applied to quantify differences between sample means.
