lumber at 10 years, the fraction is 14.1 percent (column 2 of Table 1.9). Thus, the remaining
carbon (8.2 percent), in softwood lumber has been emitted to the atmosphere by year 10.
Recycling of paper products is an assumption built into Tables 1.8 and 1.9. (See Appendix D for
details on paper recycling.) The value of including the effect of recycling on the disposition of
carbon in harvested wood products can depend on the carbon accounting information needed.
For example, recycling can affect quantities in use or in landfills if calculations are focused on a
single cohort of carbon such as paper originally produced in a specific year. That is, accounting
for effects of recycling can matter if tracking carbon from a single year or owner is important.
We include recycling of paper because recycling is relatively common, its effects may be
important, and statistics are available to include recycling in the calculations.
Tables 1.8 and 1.9 can be used to calculate net change of carbon in harvested wood products, the
cumulative effect of successive annual harvests, and carbon remaining at 100 years. The change
in carbon stocks between successive years is net annual flux. The tables are based on the
assumption that harvest and processing occur in the same year (year set to zero); they provide
annual steps for 50 years. Values can be interpolated for annualized estimates between years 50
and 100. Cumulative effects of annual harvests are obtained by repeating calculations for each
harvest and summing stock or stock change estimates for each year of interest. A numerical
application for calculating the disposition of carbon in primary wood products is provided in
Example 1.6, in which the cumulative effect of annual production at a mill is calculated. See
Appendix D for additional information on model assumptions, values used to describe allocation
and longevity, and calculations of the factors in Tables 1.7 through 1.9.
Roundwood. Roundwood4 is logs, bolts or other round sections cut from trees for industrial
manufacture or consumer use (Johnson 2001). Most roundwood is processed by mills, and it is
this quantity of harvested wood that provides the roundwood starting point in Figure 1.3.
Classification of harvested wood as roundwood is commonly a part of regional or State-wide
statistics on timber harvesting or processing (Johnson 2001, Smith and others 2004c). A regional
linkage between roundwood and the primary wood products model (discussed earlier) is the
basis for establishing the disposition of carbon from roundwood. The allocation of roundwood
to domestically produced primary wood products was constructed from Adams and others
(2006). The resulting model of the allocation of carbon in roundwood according to region and
roundwood category is represented as Table 1.6.
Table 1.6 was developed in the style of similar tables in Birdsey (1996), which are based on Row
and Phelps (1996). Inputs are carbon mass in roundwood according to region and roundwood
category. Total roundwood is allocated to the four disposition categories (see definitions in
Table 1.1), and changes in allocation are tracked as fractions over years 1 through 100 after
4 The definition and classification of roundwood as it is used here is important to quantifying and allocating carbon
in harvested wood products. The calculations in this document use roundwood as essentially logs for industrial
manufacture. Roundwood comes from both growing stock and other sources, and not all growing stock becomes
roundwood. The definition of roundwood can also include fuelwood, but fuelwood and bark on roundwood are
specifically excluded from “roundwood” as used in this document. Roundwood can be classified as sawtimber
versus pulpwood (for example, Birdsey 1996, Row and Phelps 1996) but the more common usage is sawtimber
versus poletimber (for example, Johnson 2001) or saw logs versus pulpwood.
