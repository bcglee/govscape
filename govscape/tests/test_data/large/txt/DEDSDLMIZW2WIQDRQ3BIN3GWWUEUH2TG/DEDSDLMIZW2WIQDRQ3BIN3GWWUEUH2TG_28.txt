Thus, total carbon stocks for the end of 2002 are 241,360 t, with 233,233 t in end uses and 8,127
t in landfills. The balance of the cumulative total carbon in products from 2000 through 2002
has been emitted to the atmosphere, that is, 245,547 t initially in primary products minus the
241,360 t sequestered equals 4,187 t emitted from the primary products by 2002.
Step 3: Calculate carbon remaining in end uses or in landfills at 100 years after each of the
harvest years. The estimates are based on initial stocks of carbon in each primary product
multiplied by the respective fraction remaining as obtained from Tables 1.8 and 1.9. For
example, carbon in primary product from harvest and processing in 2000 and in use at 100 years
is 20,222 t = (41,199 × 0.234) + (43,188 × 0.245).

2002 19,677 33,092
2003 20,369 34,273
Total 79,198 133,096
Thus, of the 245,547 t of carbon in primary products produced from 2000 through 2002, 24
percent remain sequestered in products in use, 40 percent in landfills, and 36 percent emitted to
the atmosphere.
