and its biomass can be estimated with its density class. Examples of how to estimate the biomass
of standing dead wood are given in Box 3.7.
Box 3.7. Calculating biomass of standing dead wood.
1. A tree with no leaves in mixed hardwood forest with a diameter of 25 cm at breast height,
density class assumed to be sound.
Use the equation of Jenkins et al. (2003) for mixed hardwood forests, 3 % deduction due to the
lack of any leaves.
y = exp (–2.4800 + 2.4835 x ln(25)) = 248.16 kg x 0.97 = 240.72 kg
As this dead tree is the only dead tree measured in a 14 m plot the mass is multiplied by the
expansion factor of 16.24 to give a biomass of 3.91 t/ha.
2. A sugar maple tree with missing branches (missing branches estimated as 15 % of
aboveground biomass). Diameter at breast height measured as 51 cm; density class assumed to
be sound.
Use the equation of Jenkins et al. (2003) for hard maple/oak/hickory/beech with a 15 %
deduction for missing biomass.
y = exp (–2.0127 + 2.4342 x ln(51)) = 1,916.3 * 0.85 = 1,628.9 kg
As this dead tree is the only dead tree measured in a 20 m plot the mass is multiplied by the
expansion factor of 7.96 to give a biomass density of 12.97 t/ha.
3. A bole with no branches is measured. The height is 15 m, basal diameter is 40 cm and top
diameter is 25 cm. Analysis of a cored sample reveals a wood density of 0.49 g/cm3.
The volume of a truncated cone = 1/3π x h x (r 2 + r 2 + r x r )
1 2 1 2
= 1/3π x 1500 x (202 + 12.52 + 20 x 12.5)
Biomass density = 1,266,455 cm3 x 0.49 g/cm3
= 620,563 g = 0.62 tons
As this dead tree is the only dead tree measured in a 14 m plot the mass is multiplied by the
expansion factor of 16.24 to give a biomass density of 10.08 t/ha.
