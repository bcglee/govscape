Table 1.1.â€”Classification of carbon in forest ecosystems and in harvested wood
Forest ecosystem carbon pools
Live trees Live trees with diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of at least 2.5 cm (1
inch), including carbon mass of coarse roots (greater than 0.2 to 0.5
cm, published distinctions between fine and coarse roots are not
always clear), stems, branches, and foliage.
Standing dead Standing dead trees with d.b.h. of at least 2.5 cm, including carbon
trees mass of coarse roots, stems, and branches.
Understory Live vegetation that includes the roots, stems, branches, and foliage
vegetation of seedlings (trees less than 2.5 cm d.b.h.), shrubs, and bushes.
Down dead Woody material that includes logging residue and other coarse dead
wood wood on the ground and larger than 7.5 cm in diameter, and stumps
and coarse roots of stumps.
Forest floor Organic material on the floor of the forest that includes fine woody
debris up to 7.5 cm in diameter, tree litter, humus, and fine roots in
the organic forest floor layer above mineral soil.
Soil organic Belowground carbon without coarse roots, but including fine roots
carbon and all other organic carbon not included in other pools, to a depth of
1 meter.
Categories for disposition of carbon in harvested wood
Products in use End-use products that have not been discarded or otherwise
destroyed, examples include residential and nonresidential
construction, wooden containers, and paper products.
Landfills Discarded wood and paper placed in landfills where most carbon is
stored long-term and only a small portion of the material is assumed
to degrade, at a slow rate.
Emitted with Combustion of wood products with concomitant energy capture as
energy capture carbon is emitted to the atmosphere.
Emitted without Carbon in harvested wood emitted to the atmosphere through
energy capture combustion or decay without concomitant energy recapture.
