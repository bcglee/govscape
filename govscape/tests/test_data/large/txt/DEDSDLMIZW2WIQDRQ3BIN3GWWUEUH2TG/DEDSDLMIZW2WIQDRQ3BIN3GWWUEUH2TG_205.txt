2.6 years, a paper recovery rate of 0.48, and an efficiency of reuse of 0.709 (Skog and Nicholson
1998, Row and Phelps 1996).
The difference between a fraction of paper in use calculated by Equation D2 for a particular year
and the fraction from the previous year represents the amount of paper discarded during that
year. We assume that 48 percent of the discarded paper is recycled and 70 percent of the fibers
in recycled paper are recovered and incorporated into new paper products. This represents a net
recovery of 33.6 percent of fibers from discarded paper. The fraction of these recycled fibers
remaining in use in subsequent years also is determined according to Equation D2. This
sequence of calculations can be repeated for the fraction of paper discarded each year. Thus, the
summed remaining fractions of the original paper and all subsequently recycled fractions are
included in Table 1.8. All these successive calculations pertain to the original paper fibers
produced from wood at the beginning of the first year, yet none of the fiber from the original
paper production is expected to remain in paper products beyond five rounds of recycling1.
Therefore, the estimates provided in Table 1.8 are based on five rounds of recycling, because
beyond this point the effects of additional rounds are negligible. Thus, each fiber has the
potential to be included in the recycling process up to five times. However, if the fiber is in the
66.4 percent (1- 0.336) of discarded paper that is lost during recycling, there is no potential for
additional recycling because it is no longer in the system.
The fractions of primary wood product remaining in landfills for a given number of years after
production in Table 1.9 were developed by determining the fraction discarded to landfills each
year and then determining the part of those fractions remaining in landfills over subsequent
years. Thus, Table 1.9 is based on years since production but accounts for both rate of disposal
to landfills and cumulative effect of residence times in landfills. Allocation to landfills occurs in
two parts: 1) the fraction discarded at year n after production is the difference in the in-use
fractions between two successive years from Table 1.8, that is, fraction at year n minus fraction
at year n-1; and 2) the part of the discarded fraction that is placed in landfills is determined by
fractions in Table D4 (the fractions for the year 2002). The fraction going to landfills is further
divided into nondegradable and degradable pools, which are supplied in Table D5. The
nondegradable pool is sequestered permanently. The fraction of the degradable pool remaining in
subsequent years is determined by first-order decay, that is,
fraction remaining=exp(-years×ln(2)/half-life), and the half-life is shown in Table D5.
Example calculations and applications of selected factors in Tables 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9 –
disposition from primary wood products
This set of example calculations determines the disposition of carbon in a primary wood product
at 3 and 100 years after production. The product for this example is 320,000 ft2 of ⅜-inch
softwood plywood. These calculations are possible with factors from Tables 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9,
but this example illustrates the foundation for those factors by using Tables D1 through D5.
Note that some of these calculations are spreadsheet-intensive, so we show only enough work to
illustrate the basic process.
Specifically, we calculate:
