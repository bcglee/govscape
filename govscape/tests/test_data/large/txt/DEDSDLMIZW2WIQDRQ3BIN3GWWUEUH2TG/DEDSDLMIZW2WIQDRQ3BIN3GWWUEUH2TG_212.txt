We calculate:
1) Carbon in growing-stock volume according to the roundwood categories (Table 1.4)
2) Carbon in roundwood from carbon in growing-stock volume (Table 1.5)
3) The additional pools of carbon in fuelwood and bark on roundwood, which are assumed
emitted with or without energy capture soon after harvest
4) Modifications to totals for roundwood or fuelwood if necessary
5) The disposition of carbon at 15 years after harvest (Table 1.6)
Part 1: Carbon in growing-stock volume is calculated with the factors in Table 1.4, which
allocates volume to four categories based on wood type and log size. The example growing-
stock volume harvested in Table 1.3 is 172.1 m3/ha. Three steps are needed to calculate total
carbon in growing-stock volume: growing stock is allocated to softwood or hardwood; volumes
are partitioned to saw logs and pulpwood; and finally, carbon mass is determined from specific
gravity of wood, which is 50 percent carbon by dry weight. Thus, the softwood saw log part of
growing stock = (growing-stock volume) × (softwood fraction) × (sawtimber-size fraction) ×
(softwood specific gravity) × (carbon fraction of wood). The calculated values from growing-
stock volume are:
Softwood sawtimber carbon
= 172.1 × 0.132 × 0.604 × 0.369 × 0.5 = 2.53 t/ha
Softwood poletimber carbon
= 172.1 × 0.132 × (1 – 0.604) × 0.369 × 0.5 = 1.66 t/ha
Hardwood sawtimber carbon
= 172.1 × (1 – 0.132) × 0.526 × 0.518 × 0.5 = 20.35 t/ha
Hardwood poletimber carbon
= 172.1 × (1 – 0.132) × (1 – 0.526) × 0.518 × 0.5 = 18.34 t/ha
Total carbon stock in 172.1 m3/ha of growing-stock volume is 42.88 t/ha.
Part 2: Carbon in roundwood, which excludes bark and fuelwood, is determined from factors in
Table 1.5. The two factors determine the fraction of growing-stock volume that is roundwood,
and the ratio of total roundwood to growing-stock volume that is roundwood. The calculated
values for roundwood are:
Softwood saw log carbon
= 2.53 × 0.948 × 0.991 = 2.38 t/ha
Softwood pulpwood carbon
= 1.66 × 0. 948 × 3.079 = 4.84 t/ha
Hardwood saw log carbon
= 20.35 × 0.879 × 0.927 = 16.58 t/ha
Hardwood pulpwood carbon
= 18.34 × 0. 879 × 2.177 = 35.09 t/ha
Thus, total carbon in roundwood is 58.90 t/ha.
Part 3: Pools of carbon in bark on roundwood are based on ratios in Table 1.5; these are also
applied to calculate bark on fuelwood. The portion of bark on roundwood allocated to emitted
with energy capture is according to coefficient A from Table D7. Carbon in fuelwood is
calculated from factors in Table 1.5. The calculations are:
