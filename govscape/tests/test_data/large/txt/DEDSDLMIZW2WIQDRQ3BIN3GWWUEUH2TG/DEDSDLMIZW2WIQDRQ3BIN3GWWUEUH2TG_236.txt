stratified in the same manner. In general, stratification also decreases the costs of monitoring
because it is expected to diminish the sampling effort necessary, while maintaining the same
level of confidence, because of smaller variation in carbon stocks in each stratum than in the
whole area. The stratification should be carried out using criteria that are directly related to the
variables to be measured and monitored, e.g. the carbon pools in trees for afforestation. For
afforestation, the strata may be defined on the basis of variables such as the tree species (if
several), age class (as generated by delay in practical planting schedules), initial vegetation (e.g.
completely cleared versus cleared with patches or scattered trees), and site factors (soil type,
elevation, and slope etc.). There is, however, a trade-off between the number of strata and
sampling intensity. The strata should be large enough to enable adequate sampling within each
stratum, but not so large as to incur higher costs. There is no hard and fast rule, and forestry
analysts need to use their expert judgment in deciding on the number of strata to include.
Site visits to the project or entity area and nearby areas with existing vegetation that will be the
target of the activity will aid in the stratification of the area. Field assessments and
measurements of key variables such as general soil type, topography, and nearby existing
vegetation all greatly aid in the stratification of the area and contribute to a cost efficient
monitoring plan.
Box 3.2. Remote sensing data
Remote sensing data are useful for a variety of tasks involved with designing and implementing
measuring and monitoring plans for forest-based carbon activities, including: provision of a land-
use map for the area, stratification of the area, land-use history, monitoring overall performance,
and providing a verifiable record that the carbon pool exists. Below is a table of selected data
sets, both public and private, that can gather data for most forestry activities. These sensors have
been rigorously calibrated to ensure accurate measurements.
