The focus of this document is to explain the methodology in a transparent way and present sets
of look-up tables for quantifying forest carbon when site-specific information is limited. In the
sections that follow, we introduce the tables and provide general guidance for their use. First,
tables of forest ecosystem carbon are presented; these are followed by tables to calculate the
disposition of carbon in harvested wood products. Additional information on methods and data
sources follows these tables. This organization was adopted so that readers interested in using
the tables can do so quickly. Both metric and English units are used for measures of area and
volume.2 However, all values for carbon mass are expressed in metric units—tonnes (t)—unless
specified otherwise. English units are included because most of the necessary input quantities
are commonly expressed in units such as cubic feet/acre (for stand-level growing-stock volume)
or thousand square feet of ⅜-inch plywood (a primary wood product), for example. Carbon
stocks and stock changes are usually discussed and reported in metric units of carbon mass; this
can lead to carbon in forests expressed as tonnes/hectare or in the United States as metric
tons/acre. The forest ecosystem carbon tables are in Appendices A, B, and C; ancillary
information on carbon in harvested wood is in Appendix D.
1.2 Forest Ecosystem Carbon Tables
Tables of estimates of forest carbon stock are provided for common forest types within each of
10 U.S. regions (Fig. 1.1). Six distinct forest ecosystem carbon pools are listed: live trees,
standing dead trees, understory vegetation, down dead wood, forest floor, and soil organic
carbon. These pools are defined in Table 1.1. As an example, the table for reforested maple-
beech-birch stands in the northeast is shown in Table 1.2. The complete set of tables are in
Appendices A and B. The first two columns in each table are age and growing-stock volume; the
remaining columns represent carbon stocks for the various carbon pools and are dependent on
age or growing-stock volume. Pools are quantified as carbon densities, that is, tonnes per unit
area (acres or hectares).
The use of the tables can be summarized in three steps: 1) identify the most appropriate table for
the particular carbon sequestration project; 2) extract the tabular information required for
estimating carbon sequestration by the project; and 3) complete any necessary custom
modifications or post-processing needed to suit data requirements. The information in the tables
is based on a national-level, forest carbon accounting model (FORCARB2; Heath and others
2003, Smith and others 2004a), a timber projection model (ATLAS; Mills and Zhou 2003, Mills
and Kincaid 1992, updated for Haynes 2003), and the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory
and Analysis (FIA) Program’s database of forest surveys (FIADB; USDA For. Serv. 2005,
Alerich and others 2005). Details are provided in the methods section.
The two basic sets of tables in Appendices A and B differ only with respect to assumptions
associated with previous land use. The first set displays carbon stocks on forest land remaining
forest land, also called “reforestation” or “regrowth” of a stand following a clearcut harvest
(Table 1.2, for example, and Appendix A). The second set displays accumulation of carbon
stocks for a stand established on land that was not forest, called “afforestation” (Appendix B).
2 A tonne (t) is defined as 106 grams, or 2,204.62 pounds (lb). Other metric and English equivalents include
0.404686 hectare (ha) = 1 acre (ac), 2.54 centimeter (cm) = 1 inch (in), 0.0283168 cubic meter (m3) = 1 cubic foot
(ft3), and 0.907185 tonne = 1 short ton = 2,000 pounds.
