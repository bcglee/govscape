discussion or example values, see Smith and others (2004b) and Smith and Heath (2005)). The
carbon density of forest floor is a function of region, forest type, and stand age (Smith and Heath
2002). Estimates of soil organic carbon are based on the national STATSGO spatial database
(USDA Soil Conserv. Serv. 1991) and the general approach described by Amichev and Galbraith
(2004). These represent average soil organic carbon by region and forest type in the Forest
Serviceâ€™s Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) 2002 Forest Resource Assessment
database. For additional information, see USDA For. Serv. (2005) and Smith and others
(2004c).
Slight modifications to the direct application of FORCARB2 estimators were incorporated to
develop the reforestation (Table 1.2 and Appendix A) and afforestation (Appendix B) tables.
The reforestation tables are based on the assumption that at harvest, a portion of slash becomes
down dead wood or forest floor at the start of the next rotation; these additional components then
decay with time in the new stand (Smith and Heath 2002). The initial carbon densities for down
dead wood and forest floor are listed in the first row of the Appendix A tables. Values for down
dead wood are proportional to levels at the time of harvest and added logging residue (based on
Johnson (2001)). Decay rates for down dead wood and forest floor are calculated from Turner
and others (1995) and Smith and Heath (2002). The afforestation tables are based on the
reforestation tables with the assumption that the residual carbon of down dead wood and forest-
floor material remaining after harvest does not exist at the start of the afforested stands. Thus,
these pools are set to zero at the first row of the table. Accumulation of soil organic carbon in
previously nonforest land (the afforestation tables) is based on the accumulation function
described in West and others (2004) with the assumption that soil carbon density is initially at 75
percent of the average forest value, which is within the range of values associated with soil
organic carbon after deforestation (Lal 2005). Users with more specific data about soil organic
carbon or effects of previous land use can easily modify the tables to reflect this information.
The tables are designed to accommodate modification or replacement of selected data. Estimates
for years or stand volumes not defined explicitly can be determined with linear interpolation
(Example 1.2). The separate carbon pools, according to column, allow the user to extract or
substitute values as needed to complement separately obtained site-specific information.
However, users should be aware of the relationships between the parts as described in Figure 1.2
to substitute columns.
Figure 1.2 can be used as a guide in customizing tables. As an example, a user with a model of
stand growth for a particular project but still wishing to use the carbon estimates from a table
should: 1) choose an appropriate carbon table by matching forest type, 2) make the appropriate
substitutions of new data, and 3) then recalculate the carbon columns affected by the substitution.
After the age and volume columns are replaced, recalculations based on interpolation are
required for carbon pools of live and standing dead trees, understory vegetation, and down dead
wood. Forest floor is determined by stand age, and values of soil carbon depend on assumptions
that apply to reforestation or afforestation (Fig. 1.2). The substitutions and recalculations can be
made by using a spreadsheet. Example 1.3 expands on this discussion and provides a numerical
example.
