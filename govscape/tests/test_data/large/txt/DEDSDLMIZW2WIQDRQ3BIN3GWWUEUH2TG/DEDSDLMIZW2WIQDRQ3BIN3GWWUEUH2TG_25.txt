Thus, total carbon stock in roundwood is 148.36 t/ha.
Step 3: The disposition of carbon in harvested wood products is described by Table 1.6, which
allocates carbon according to region, roundwood category, and years since harvest and
processing. The allocation factors for product in use at year 15 for Pacific Northwest, West
apply here. The two hardwood categories are pooled in this region. The calculation for carbon
density of products in use is the sum of the products of roundwood carbon and the corresponding
allocation factor, these are:
Carbon in products in use at year 15
= (124.26 × 0.423) + (13.31 × 0.020) + ((1.78 + 1.03) × 0.174) = 53.33 t/ha.
