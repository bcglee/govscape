It is clear that the two methods give widely different results. Although in this example the
temporary plot gives a negative change in stock, it could just as readily give a larger positive
change than the permanent plots.
3.4.1.2 Non-tree vegetation
Herbaceous plants in forest understory can be measured by simple harvesting techniques in small
subplots (2-4 per plot are recommended) within each sample plot (Figure 3.4). A small frame
(either circular or square), usually encompassing about 0.25 m2 can be used. The material inside
the frame is cut to ground level, pooled by plot, and weighed. Well-mixed sub-samples are then
oven-dried to determine dry-to-wet mass ratios. These ratios are then used to convert the entire
sample to oven-dry mass.
For shrubs and other large non-tree vegetation it is desirable to measure the biomass by simple
destructive harvesting techniques. A small sub-plot (dependent on the size of the vegetation) is
established and all the shrub vegetation is harvested and weighed. An alternative approach, if the
shrubs are large, is to develop local shrub biomass regression equations based on variables such
as crown area and height or diameter at base of plant or some other relevant variable (e.g.,
number of stems in multi-stemmed shrubs). The equations would then be based on regressions
of biomass of the shrub versus some logical combination of the independent variables.
3.4.2 Belowground biomass
The measurement of aboveground biomass is relatively established and simple. Belowground
biomass (coarse and fine roots), however, can only be measured with time-consuming methods.
Consequently it is more efficient and effective to apply a regression model to determine
belowground biomass from knowledge of aboveground biomass. The following regression
models can be used to estimate belowground biomass (Cairns et al., 1997):
Boreal:
BBD (t/ha) = exp(-1.0587 + 0.8836 x ln ABD + 0.1874)
Temperate:
BBD = exp(-1.0587 + 0.8836 x ln ABD + 0.2840)
Tropical:
BBD = exp(-1.0587 + 0.8836 x ln ABD)
Where BBD = belowground biomass density in tons per hectare (t/ha) and ABD = aboveground
biomass density (t/ha)
n = 151; r2 = 0.84
Applying these equations allows an accurate assessment of belowground biomass. This is the
most practical and cost-effective method of determining biomass of roots.
