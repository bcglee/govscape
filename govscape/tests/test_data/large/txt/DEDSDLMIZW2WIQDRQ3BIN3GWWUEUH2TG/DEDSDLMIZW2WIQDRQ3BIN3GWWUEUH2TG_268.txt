3.4.5 Non-CO gases
2
Although the primary purpose of forestry activities is to increase carbon stocks, forestry
activities may also result in changes in non-CO greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Such
2
activities include biomass burning; application of synthetic and organic fertilizers to soils;
cultivation of nitrogen fixing trees; and peat flooding and drainage. In addition, land-use
activities that disturb soils, e.g., site preparation during afforestation, may affect non-CO
2
emissions and removals from soils. For many cases, changes in non-CO greenhouse gas
2
emissions or removals caused by these activities will be small relative to net changes in carbon
stocks over the lifetime of the activity. No guidelines are provided in this document for
monitoring, estimating, or reporting significant fluxes of non-CO gases for forestry.

3.5 Estimation Methods and Uncertainty
3.5.1 Estimating net change for the system
The type of activity influences how each of the carbon stock components are integrated into an
estimate of the net change in carbon stock at each monitoring interval. The activities listed in
Table 3.2 can be grouped into two main classes. The first class includes those that would
typically be implemented on non-forested lands (afforestation, forest restoration, agroforestry,
short-rotation biomass energy plantations and mine land reclamations). The other class includes
those activities implemented on existing forested land (forest management and forest
preservation). This grouping has implications for how measurements and estimations are
integrated to arrive at an estimate of the net change in total carbon stocks in the time interval.
3.5.1.1 Activities on non-forested lands
All activities on non-forested lands typically begin on land that initially has very low carbon
stocks in vegetation (generally less than a couple of tons/ha) and variable amounts in the soil. In
each of these cases a sampling regime would be implemented that monitors each of the carbon
stock components indicated in Table 3.2. These methods have already been discussed above in
section 3.4. The task is then how to combine all the estimates of the carbon stock for each
component to arrive at an estimate of the net change in total carbon.
Using permanent plots, the carbon stock for living and standing dead trees above- and
belowground and down dead wood of individual plots can be monitored through time and
therefore the change in carbon stocks can be estimated directly at the plot level. In this case the
change in carbon stocks for the different components should be summed within plots to give a
per plot carbon stock change in t C/ha. The plot level results are then averaged to give mean and
95 % confidence intervals. The mean change in carbon stocks per unit area is then multiplied by
the area of the activity to produce an estimate of the total change in carbon. If stratification is
used, this approach is repeated for each stratum and then all strata are added together to estimate
the total. This total is then converted to t CO equivalent by multiplying by 3.67.
