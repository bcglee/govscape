Coefficients from Table 1.8 are necessary because the amount discarded each year is
based on the difference between the amounts in use at the start and end of each year. By
multiplying 75.41 by the first four softwood plywood coefficients in Table 1.8, we obtain
in-use stocks of 75.41, 73.60, 71.79, and 70.13 t carbon, which represent the time of
processing (the beginning of year 1) and the ends of years 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Nondegradable fraction from year 1
= (75.41-73.60) × 0.67 × 0.77 = 0.9337 t
Degradable fraction from year 1 remaining at year 3
= (75.41-73.60) × 0.67 × (1-0.77) × exp(-2×ln(2)/14) = 0.2526 t
Nondegradable fraction from year 2
= (73.60-71.79) × 0.67 × 0.77 = 0.9337 t
Degradable fraction from year 2 remaining at year 3
= (73.60-71.79) × 0.67 × (1-0.77) × exp(-1×ln(2)/14) = 0.2654 t
Nondegradable fraction from year 3
= (71.79-70.13) × 0.67 × 0.77 = 0.8559 t
Degradable fraction from year 3 remaining at year 3
= (71.79-70.13) × 0.67 × (1-0.77) × exp(-0×ln(2)/14) = 0.2557 t
Thus, total carbon in landfills at the end of the third year = 3.5 t.
Note that the fraction of softwood plywood in landfills at the end of year 3 in Table 1.9
can be determined from the previous series of calculations by changing the first factor in
each line to represent the relative amount discarded each year rather than the absolute
amount. The calculations are:
Nondegradable fraction from year 1
= (1-0.976) × 0.67 × 0.77 = 0.0124
Degradable fraction from year 1 remaining at year 3
= (1-0.976) × 0.67 × (1-0.77) × exp(-2×ln(2)/14) = 0.0034
Nondegradable fraction from year 2
= (0.976-0.952) × 0.67 × 0.77 = 0.0124
Degradable fraction from year 2 remaining at year 3
= (0.976-0.952) × 0.67 × (1-0.77) × exp(-1×ln(2)/14) = 0.0035
Nondegradable fraction from year 3
= (0.952-0.930) × 0.67 × 0.77 = 0.0114
Degradable fraction from year 3 remaining at year 3
= (0.952-0.930) × 0.67 × (1-0.77) × exp(-0×ln(2)/14) = 0.0034
Thus, total fraction in landfills at year the end of the third year = 0.047. The difference
between this value and the 0.046 in Table 1.9 is due to rounding.
Net flux of carbon to landfills at year 3 is the difference between the previous values and
similar calculations for year 2, or more simply from Table 1.9:
75.41 × (0.046 - 0.032) = 1.06 t in year 3
A similar series of calculations can be repeated for year 100, or more simply from Tables
1.8 and 1.9: the amount of carbon in landfills at 100 years = 75.41 × 0.400 = 3.2 t, and
the flux of carbon in landfills at 100 years = 75.41 × (0.400-0.394)/5 = 0.09 t in year 100.
