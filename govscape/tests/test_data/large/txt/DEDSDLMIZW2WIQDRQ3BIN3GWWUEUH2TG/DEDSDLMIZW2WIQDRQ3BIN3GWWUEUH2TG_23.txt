To construct the modified table, copy the first two columns directly from the new yield table and
then interpolate some of the carbon pool densities from Table A47. Estimates for live- and
standing dead trees are dependent on growing-stock volume (as indicated in Fig. 1.2). These
values can be determined by linear interpolation as described in Example 1.2. Similarly,
understory and down dead wood stocks, which are dependent on the updated live tree carbon
stocks (Fig. 1.2), can be determined by interpolation. For example, the value of down dead
wood carbon stock in row two is based on linearly interpolating between rows three and four of
Table A47, that is, down dead wood = (29.2 - 23.1) / (32.4 - 23.1) Ã— (6.2 - 6.8) + 6.8 = 6.4 t/ha.
Interpolation is not necessary for estimates of forest floor or soil organic carbon. Forest floor is a
function of stand age, and soil organic carbon is 41.9 t/ha.
