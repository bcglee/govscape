where Δ is the change in carbon of live biomass and dead biomass caused by timber harvesting.
The estimates of each term can be made annually or over longer time periods.
Δ live biomass C = (rate of C accumulation over the time interval – [biomass C from logging
damage + C in timber extracted])
The change in live biomass caused by logging is a result of the extraction of timber, the slash
from the harvested tree, and damage to residual trees, all of which will cause a decrease in live
biomass or represent a negative quantity after harvest. On the positive side is the rate of carbon
accumulation during regrowth that applies to those areas affected by timber extraction.
Estimating the amount of damaged and dead biomass produced in the logging operations
involves establishing field plots around a harvested tree(s) (the plot usually has dimensions
equivalent to the distance from the stump to the top of the harvested tree and as wide as the
crown diameter of the harvested tree), collecting information about the initial diameter and
height of the harvested tree, measuring the amount of volume removed, and measuring the
diameter of all trees that were severely damaged and presumed to be dead. The number of such
plots to establish and sample would be based on the same procedures described above in section
3.2.3.2. These measurements are then combined to produce a ratio of total amount of live
biomass converted to dead biomass per unit mass of timber extracted. The rate of carbon
accumulation in the regrowing forest could be obtained from measurements of tagged trees in the
sample plot over time as described in section 3.4.1.1, but only applied to the area affected by the
logging (area of the gap).
Δ dead biomass C = (dead biomass from logging damage and slash x decomposition rate)
The slash and damaged wood is assumed to enter the dead wood pool, where it starts to
decompose. Each year more dead wood is added from harvesting, but each year some is lost
because of decomposition and resulting emissions of carbon. Decomposition of dead wood is
modeled as a simple exponential function based on mass of dead wood and a decomposition
coefficient (proportion decomposed per year). The decomposition coefficients for a variety of
forest types are given in Table 3.6. The change in carbon stocks of the slash and damaged wood
could be measured in the field but it tends to be time consuming and costly. The range of
decomposition rates given in Table 3.6 covers all major forest types in the US. Mean total
changes in carbon stocks and 95% confidence intervals could then be calculated in the same way
as shown in Box 3.9.
3.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)
Measuring and monitoring requires provisions for quality assurance (QA) and quality control
(QC) to be implemented via a QA/QC plan to ensure that the reported carbon units are reliable
and meet minimum measurement standards. The plan should become part of the documentation
and include procedures for: (1) collecting reliable field measurements; (2) verifying laboratory
procedures; (3) verifying data entry and analysis techniques and; (4) data maintenance and
archiving.
