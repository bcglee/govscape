2.1 Introduction
Forest carbon accounting estimates are almost always based, at least in part, on models. Models
are a simplification of a complex system, often coded into computer programs. For forestry
applications, models usually consist of a series of mathematical equations designed to represent
ecological processes of forests. In some cases models may be as simple as an equation based on
a multiplier, such as multiplying dry weight biomass by 0.5 for an estimate of carbon.
Models are available for estimating carbon stocks and flows for forests at a variety of scales and
for specific conditions and activities. Some models may be more accurate than look-up tables for
specific activities or entities, but may require more effort and possibly a higher cost to apply.
Models may be useful tools for estimating both entity-wide carbon flows and activity-level
accomplishments, but the estimates should be evaluated to be sure the models are appropriate for
each application. The basic elements of model evaluation are described in section 2.3.
Before using a model, it is necessary to determine the area of land to be included in the estimate,
and characterize that area in a way that is compatible with the estimates from the model. To
achieve the best results, the selected model should be parameterized for the specific conditions of
the land area to which the model is applied. Partitioning of the land area into relatively uniform
strata may help in matching and parameterizing a model for a specific application.
2.2 Kinds of models
Two general classes of models can be used to estimate changes in carbon stocks. Entities may
use either type of model provided the guidance in this section is followed.
Traditional empirical forestry models, developed to predict timber production (estimated in
volume units), can be modified to predict carbon stocks or flows. The modification may be as
simple as converting the estimated volume to carbon using standard coefficients or ratios from
the literature (e.g., Hoover et al., 2000). However, a more complex approach may be required to
fully account for changes in all of the ecosystem carbon pools, some of which may not be
directly related to volume.
More recently, models that include representation of key ecosystem processes such as
photosynthesis and respiration are becoming available. An appealing feature of such models is
that they may be applied to conditions and treatments beyond those represented in the data used
to develop the models; however, this extrapolation should be done cautiously with appropriate
verification to ensure the accuracy of estimates. Ecosystem process models often produce
outputs in units of mass (carbon). Many ecosystem process models have been developed for
research applications, but this does not limit their use or potential for application to practical
forest management issues (e.g., Battaglia and Sands, 1998; Valentine, 1999).
