change, while dead wood, which is also highly variable, can be a large component of the net
change and so higher precision of estimating that carbon pool often reduces the overall
variability of the estimated net change in carbon.
The sample size for monitoring in each stratum needs to be calculated on the basis of the
estimated variance of the carbon stock in each stratum and the proportional area of the stratum.
Typically, to estimate the number of plots needed for monitoring, at a given confidence level, it
is necessary to first obtain an estimate of the expected variance of the carbon stock in trees in
each stratum. This can be accomplished either from existing data of the type of activity to be
implemented (e.g., a forest inventory in an area representative of the proposed activityâ€”see e.g.
Box 3.3) or by making measurements on an existing area representing the proposed activity. For
example, if the activity is to afforest agricultural lands and the activity will last for 20 years, then
a measure of the carbon stocks in the trees of about 10-15 plots (for plot dimensions see below)
of an existing 20 year forest would suffice. If the project area comprises more than one stratum,
then this procedure needs to be repeated for each one. Such measurements will provide estimates
of the variance in each stratum and with the area of the stratum, the total number of plots per
stratum can be estimated using standard statistical methods (see Users Manual and worksheet at

As sampling plots cannot always be relocated or reoccupied for a variety of reasons (e.g., plot
markers are overgrown or are removed by people, plots are burned or records are lost), it is
prudent to increase the number of plots beyond the minimum in the initial sampling design. By
increasing the number of plots to some percentage over the calculated minimum number of
samples, there is a cushion that helps to meet the minimum precision requirements even though
there are missing plots in subsequent inventories. It is recommended that the minimum sample
size be increased by 10 to 15% to allow for plots that cannot be relocated.
Entities that contemplate progressive plantings over time must develop an open-ended
monitoring framework that can accommodate the progressive addition of plantings to the area
over time. This can be done by predicting the eventual size of the area at year X and
progressively assigning distinct stand-age cohorts to separate strata within the overall, and
growing, population, anticipating a full contingent of permanent sample plots to be installed by
year X. It is recommended that no more than two or three age classes be combined into one
cohort class.
Unlike sampling for trees as described above, the same soil sample cannot be monitored over
time. Instead, on each sample collection, the unit sampled (soil sample) is destroyed for the
analysis of its relevant components, and as variability among samples is high even at small
spatial scales, the statistical concept of paired samples, even if collected only centimeters apart,
cannot be reliably employed. Thus the changes in mean soil carbon between two temporally-
separated sample pools are best quantified by comparing means, via the Reliable Minimum
Estimate (RME) approach (Dawkins, 1957), or by directly calculating the difference between the
means and associated confidence limits (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). The objective is not to
establish that the two means are significantly different, but rather to estimate with 95%
confidence the minimum change in mean soil carbon that has taken place from one monitoring
