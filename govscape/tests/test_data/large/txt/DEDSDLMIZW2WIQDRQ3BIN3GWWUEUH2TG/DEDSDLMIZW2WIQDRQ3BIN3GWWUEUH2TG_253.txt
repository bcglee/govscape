An alternative approach for estimating biomass of forests is to base it on the volume of the
commercial component of the tree. The volume of the commercial component is estimated using
standard techniques in forestry. This method is commonly used with temporary plots. The
estimated volume then needs to be converted to total aboveground biomass, including the other
tree components, such as branches, twigs, and leaves. This volume-based method is based on
factors developed at the stand level, for closed canopy forests, and cannot be used for estimating
biomass of individual trees.
There are two potential methods. The first calculates biomass directly from stand volume for
different vegetation types in different regions, and the second has the additional step of
calculating a biomass expansion factor (BEF) that can be broadly applied to three vegetation
types across the United States. In both cases, growing stock volume (GSV)is defined as the net
outside bark volume of growing-stock trees at least 12.5 cm in diameter to a minimum of 10 cm
diameter at tree top or at the point where the central stem breaks into limbs (definition used by
the USFS forest inventory). Other definitions of volume could be used but the BEFs reported
here could not be applied—new ones would have to developed for local conditions.
1. Direct Method – Smith, Heath and Jenkins 2003
Smith et al. (2003) used growing stock volume data from the FIA and the biomass equations of
Jenkins et al. (2003) to develop regression equations of the form:
Aboveground biomass (t/ha) = F x (G + (1-exp(-GSV (m3/ha) /H))
Where
GSV = growing stock volume
F, G, H = regression coefficients
A total of 57 variants of this equation were developed for a variety of forest types across 10
regions in the continental US. Details of the coefficients for each of the variants of the equation
can be found in Smith et al. (2003; the manuscript can be downloaded from the internet:

2. Biomass Expansion Factor Method – Schroeder et al. 1997, Brown and Schroeder 1999.
This method is expressed as (Brown and Schroeder, 1999):
Aboveground biomass (t/ha) = GSV (m3/ha) x BEF (t/m3)
Where:
GSV = growing stock volume
BEF = [total aboveground biomass of all living trees to a minimum diameter at breast height of
2.5 cm]/[growing stock volume]
