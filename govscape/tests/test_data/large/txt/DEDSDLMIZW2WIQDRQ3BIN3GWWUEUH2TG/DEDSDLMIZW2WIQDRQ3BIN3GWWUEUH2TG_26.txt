Example 1.5 – Calculate the disposition of carbon in harvested wood products at 100 years
after harvest and processing from roundwood data
Using Table 1.6, assume that a harvest in the Northeast produced 2,000 t dry weight of
roundwood. This represents 1,000 t of carbon because wood is assumed to be 50 percent carbon.
The roundwood was harvested in the following proportions: 79 t carbon as softwood sawtimber,
51 t as softwood pulpwood, 465 t of hardwood sawtimber, and 405 t of hardwood pulpwood.
Also assume that these quantities represent roundwood without bark and exclude fuelwood; thus
Table 1.6 is the correct choice to calculate the disposition of carbon.
The four roundwood categories are allocated to the classifications for the disposition of
carbon in wood products by the appropriate factors for 100 years after production from
the Northeast portion of Table 1.6.
Total carbon in use = sum of four fractions
= (79 × 0.095) + (51 × 0.006) + (465 × 0.035) + (405 × 0.103) = 65.80 t
Total carbon in landfills = sum of four fractions
= (79 × 0.223) + (51 × 0.084) + (465 × 0.281) + (405 × 0.158) = 216.56 t
Total carbon emitted with energy recapture = sum of four fractions
= (79 × 0.338) + (51 × 0.510) + (465 × 0.387) + (405 × 0.336) = 368.75 t
Total carbon emitted without energy recapture = sum of four fractions
= (79 × 0.344) + (51 × 0.400) + (465 × 0.296) + (405 × 0.403) = 348.43 t
Total carbon in roundwood after 100 years is the sum of the four pools. Note that the total in this
example is 999.5 t and not the 1,000 t we started with; this is due to rounding.
