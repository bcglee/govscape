Softwood saw log bark carbon = 2.38 × 0.182 = 0.43 t/ha
Softwood pulpwood bark carbon = 4.84 × 0. 185 = 0.90 t/ha
Hardwood saw log bark carbon = 16.58 × 0.199 = 3.30 t/ha
Hardwood pulpwood bark carbon = 35.09 × 0. 218 = 7.65 t/ha
Thus, total carbon in bark on roundwood is 12.28 t/ha.
Part of carbon in bark on roundwood emitted with energy capture is
= (0.43 × 0.5582) + (0.90 × 0.6289) + (3.30 × 0.6143) + (7.65 × 0.5272)
= 6.87 t/ha
Part of carbon in bark on roundwood emitted without energy capture is
= 12.28 – 6.87 = 5.41 t/ha
Softwood saw log carbon in fuelwood with bark
= 2.53 × 0.948 × 0.136 × (1 + 0.182) = 0.39 t/ha
Softwood pulpwood carbon in fuelwood with bark
= 1.66 × 0. 948 × 0.136 × (1 + 0.185) = 0.25 t/ha
Hardwood saw log carbon in fuelwood with bark
= 20.35 × 0.879 × 0.547 × (1 + 0.199) = 11.73 t/ha
Hardwood pulpwood carbon in fuelwood with bark
= 18.34 × 0. 879 × 0.547 × (1 + 0.218) = 10.74 t/ha
Thus, total carbon in fuelwood with bark is 23.11 t/ha.
Part 4: Limits are placed on values calculated for roundwood and fuelwood where the regional
average factors result in extreme values for some forest types (as discussed above). Based on
biomass component equations, total carbon in roundwood with bark is limited to 66 percent of
live tree carbon density, and the sum of roundwood, fuelwood, and bark is limited to 78 percent.
Live tree carbon density at harvest is 113.1 t/ha (from Table B2).
The sum of roundwood and bark is less than 66 percent of live tree carbon
(58.90 + 12.28) / 113.1 = 0.629
However, the sum of roundwood, fuelwood, and bark is greater than 78 percent of live
tree carbon
(58.90 + 12.28 + 23.11) / 113.1 = 0.834
Therefore, the seven carbon pools are reduced by the factor 0.78/0.834=0.935
Roundwood softwood saw log = 2.38 × 0. 935 = 2.22 t/ha
Roundwood softwood pulpwood = 4.84 × 0. 935 = 4.53 t/ha
Roundwood hardwood saw log = 16.58 × 0. 935 = 15.50 t/ha
Roundwood hardwood pulpwood = 35.09 × 0. 935 = 32.81 t/ha
Roundwood bark emitted with energy capture = 6.87 × 0. 935 = 6.42 t/ha
Roundwood bark emitted without energy capture = 5.41 × 0. 935 = 5.06 t/ha
Fuelwood with bark = 23.11 × 0. 935 = 21.61 t/ha
