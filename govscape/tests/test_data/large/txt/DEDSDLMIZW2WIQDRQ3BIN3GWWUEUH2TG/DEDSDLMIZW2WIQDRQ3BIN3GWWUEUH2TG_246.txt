was a timber production forest. In other words, all the live biomass “protected” by the activity
(either as preservation or reduced logging intensity) cannot be claimed as a savings for the
atmosphere because some of the biomass went into long-term wood products.

1 No methods are provided for measuring this pool as the focus of this report is on ecosystem carbon; see
another technical appendix for methods for estimating change in stocks of wood products
Letters in the above table refer to the need for measuring and monitoring the carbon pools:
Y= Yes - the change in this pool is likely to be large and should be measured.
N = No - the change is likely small to none and thus it is not necessary to measure this pool.
M = Maybe - the change in this pool may need to be measured depending upon the forest type and/or
management intensity of the project.
Numbers in the above table refer to different methods for measuring and monitoring the carbon pools:
1= See methods of carbon stock measurement for aboveground biomass of trees (Section 4.1.1)
2 = See methods described for aboveground biomass of non-trees vegetation (Section 4.1.2)
3 = See methods for measuring/estimating the carbon stock in belowground biomass (Section 4.2).
4 = See methods for measuring the carbon stock in forest floor (4.3.1)
5 = See methods for measuring dead wood (Section 4.3.2).
6 = See methods for measuring the carbon pool in soils (Section 4.4).
