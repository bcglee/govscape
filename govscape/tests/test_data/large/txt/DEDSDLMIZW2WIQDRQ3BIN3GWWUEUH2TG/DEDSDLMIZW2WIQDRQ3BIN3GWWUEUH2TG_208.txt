Roundwood
Industrial roundwood is basically harvested logs brought to mills for processing. Roundwood, as
used here, refers to wood that is processed to primary wood products; it excludes bark or
roundwood that is identified as fuelwood. Input values for calculations from this starting point
are carbon mass of roundwood logs grouped by categories defined for Table 1.6. The links
between these inputs and the disposition of carbon in primary wood products are the allocation
patterns described in Tables D6 and D7.
Carbon mass of roundwood logs is categorized as softwood or hardwood and saw logs or
pulpwood. However, if roundwood data are not classified according to type or size of logs, this
appendix includes factors for distributing roundwood to appropriate categories according to
regional averages. Additionally, roundwood data in the form of volume of wood can be
converted to carbon with average values for specific gravity of softwood or hardwood species.
These factors are included in Tables 1.4 or D8.See additional discussion of their use in the
section on Forest Ecosystem.
Average disposition patterns of roundwood carbon by region and roundwood category are
presented in Table 1.6. These values were developed from regional average allocation of
roundwood to primary wood products in Table D6. Disposition of carbon allocated to primary
wood products then follows the patterns described above by Tables 1.8 and 1.9, which allocate
carbon to in-use or landfill classifications. The balance of carbon originally in roundwood but no
longer in use or in landfills is emitted to the atmosphere. The fraction emitted to the atmosphere
that occurs with energy recapture is calculated using Table D7 (Birdsey 1996). These fractions
for primary products are pooled within regions to allocate roundwood carbon for up to four
categories per region. These fractional values are displayed in Table 1.6, which is the resulting
net effect of linking information in Tables D6, 1.8, 1.9, and D7.
Example calculations related to constructing and applying Table 1.6 – disposition from
roundwood
This example calculates the disposition of carbon in roundwood. We calculate the disposition of
carbon at 15 years after harvest and the processing of 10,000 m3 of hardwood saw logs from a
maple-beech-birch forest in the Northeast. The example demonstrates the basic set of
calculations used to develop and apply Table 1.6. It is limited in scope because factorial
combinations of year, roundwood categories, and classifications for the disposition of carbon in
harvested wood products can require a sequence of many repeated spreadsheet calculations.
We calculate:
1) Carbon mass based on volume of saw logs
2) The allocation of carbon from saw logs at year 15 – the allocation values in Table 1.6
3) The disposition of carbon – apply the allocation factors from Table 1.6 to carbon mass
from step 1
