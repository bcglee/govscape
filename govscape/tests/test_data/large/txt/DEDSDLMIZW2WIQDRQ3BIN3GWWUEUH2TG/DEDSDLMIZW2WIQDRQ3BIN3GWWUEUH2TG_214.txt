These modified values are used in subsequent calculations and are applied to the harvest
scenario tables. Such modifications occur infrequently with the tables presented in
Appendix C.
Part 5: The four pools of roundwood carbon are each allocated to the four disposition categories
for carbon in wood products according to Table 1.6. Totals are the summed products of
roundwood carbon and allocation at year 15. Carbon in fuelwood and bark are one-time
additions to the emitted columns (in Appendix C). Thus the disposition of carbon at year 15 is
calculated as:
Total roundwood carbon in use
= (2.22 × 0.326) + (4.53 × 0.037) + (15.50 × 0.260) + (32.81 × 0.252) = 13.19 t/ha
Total roundwood carbon in landfills
= (2.22 × 0.126) + (4.53 × 0.128) + (15.50 × 0.198) + (32.81 × 0.127) = 8.10 t/ha
Total roundwood carbon emitted with energy recapture
= (2.22 × 0.296) + (4.53 × 0.497) + (15.50 × 0.324) + (32.81 × 0.310) = 18.10 t/ha
Total roundwood carbon emitted without energy recapture
= (2.22 × 0.252) + (4.53 × 0.338) + (15.50 × 0.218) + (32.81 × 0.311) = 15.67 t/ha
Total carbon emitted with energy recapture is the sum of roundwood, bark, and fuelwood
= 18.10 + 6.42 + 21.61 = 46.13 t/ha
Total carbon emitted without energy recapture is the sum of roundwood and bark
= 15.67 + 5.06 = 20.73 t/ha
These are the carbon density values for the four harvested wood classifications at 15
years after harvest in Table 1.3 (that is, 13.2, 8.1, 46.1, and 20.7). The differences
between values in this example and those in the table are due to rounding subtotals in this
example.
