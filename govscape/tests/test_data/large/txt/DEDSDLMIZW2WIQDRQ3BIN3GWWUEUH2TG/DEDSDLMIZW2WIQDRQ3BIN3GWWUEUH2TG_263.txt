3.4.4 Soil organic carbon
To obtain an accurate inventory of organic carbon stocks in the mineral soil or organic soil, three
types of variables must be measured: soil depth, soil bulk density (calculated from the oven-dry
weight of soil from a known volume of sampled material), and the concentrations of organic
