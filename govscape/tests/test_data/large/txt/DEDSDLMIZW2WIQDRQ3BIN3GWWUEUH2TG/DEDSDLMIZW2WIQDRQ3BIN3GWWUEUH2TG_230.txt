model output with field data. Selection criteria for an appropriate statistical test should include
the ability to quantify the percentage difference between the model output and the data at the
95% confidence level, or the ability to test a hypothesis that the difference between model output
and the data is not greater than a specific percentage at the 95% confidence level.
2.5 Rating estimates from models
As discussed in the general forest inventory guidelines, the rating for using a model depends on
how well the model represents the specific conditions of the land area, as determined by the
model evaluation. If the model is a good fit, it should result in a “B” rating. A model that is
developed specifically for the land conditions and management practices of the reporter may
achieve a higher rating, especially if the model is validated following guidelines in section 1.4.
To achieve an “A” rating from using a model for estimating changes in carbon stocks,
comparison with field data from the area of model application is required. Use of an
inappropriate model for the land characteristics and practices may result in a lower rating. The
following table provides some more specific guidance about rating a model application:
Rating Characterization Typical Description for Forestry
A Most accurate method Model is validated with data specific to the
(within 10 % of true site conditions and management practices.
value)
B Adequate accuracy Use of a model that is parameterized
(within 20 % of true specifically for the site conditions and
value) management practices.
C Marginal accuracy Use of a model that generally matches the site
(within 30 % of true and management conditions. For example, a
value) regional model for a forest type that is similar
in application to a look-up table.
D Inadequate accuracy Use of global estimates.
