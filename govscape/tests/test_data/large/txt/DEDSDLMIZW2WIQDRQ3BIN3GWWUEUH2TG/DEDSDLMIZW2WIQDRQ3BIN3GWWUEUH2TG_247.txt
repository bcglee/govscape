3.4 Measurement and Data Analysis Techniques
Measurements of net carbon flows for forests generally lend themselves to the stock-change
estimation method—that is the amount of carbon sequestered is estimated as the net change in
carbon stocks over a period of time. Much of the discussion in section 3.2 above focuses on the
design needed to precisely estimate changes in carbon stocks. Although for most components
the stock change method is applicable, for some components the flow method may be
appropriate. For example, changes in the dead wood pool are often estimated from the difference
between inputs from slash (estimated from the difference between total tree biomass and mass of
timber removed) and outputs from decomposition of the dead wood. In the next sections,
methods for both the stock and flow approach, when appropriate, are presented for estimating the
change in carbon stocks.
Methods are based on measurements and models resulting in estimates of biomass, except for
soil, which can be measured in units of carbon directly. Biomass is generally converted to units
of carbon by multiplying biomass by 0.5, unless more specific data are available.
3.4.1. Living aboveground biomass
3.4.1.1. Trees
The carbon stocks of trees are most accurately and precisely estimated through the use of direct
methods, i.e. through a field inventory, where all the trees in the sample plots above a minimum
diameter are measured. The minimum diameter is often 5 cm at dbh, but can vary depending on
the expected size of trees —for arid environments where trees grow slowly, the minimum
diameter may be as small as 2.5 cm diameter, whereas for humid environments where trees grow
rapidly it could be up to 10 cm diameter. Biomass and carbon stock are estimated using
appropriate allometric equations applied to the tree measurements. For practical purposes, tree
biomass is often estimated from equations that relate biomass to dbh only. Although the
combination of dbh and height as the independent variable is often superior to dbh alone,
measuring tree height can be time consuming and will increase the expense of any monitoring
program. Furthermore, the empirical database of trees in the US shows that highly significant
biomass regression equations can be developed with very high r-squares using just dbh (see
Tables 3.3 and 3.4).
Often biomass equations are reported for individual species or groups of species, but this
literature is sometimes inconsistent and incomplete for all tree species in the United States.
However, it has been shown by recent analyses that equations based on multi-species groupings
can work well for US forests (Schroeder et al. 1997).
Jenkins et al. (2003) compiled all available diameter-based allometric regression equations for
estimating total aboveground and component biomass, defined in dry mass terms, for trees in the
United States. A total of 318 biomass equations were assembled for over 100 species from 104
sources (Jenkins et al. 2003). Jenkins et al. used a method to generate “pseudodata” (Pastor et al.
1984) by calculating biomass values for a range of diameters within bounds of raw data for each
equation. These pseudodata were used to refit new equations for 10 broad species groups (Table
3.3; details of the species in each of the 10 groups can be found in Jenkins et al. 2003).
