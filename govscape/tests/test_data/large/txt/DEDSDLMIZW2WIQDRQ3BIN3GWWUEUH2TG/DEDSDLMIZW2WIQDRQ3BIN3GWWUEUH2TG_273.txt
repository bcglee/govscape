the rate of decomposition, the larger the amount that accumulates. Measurement of soil organic
carbon is, at best, marginally beneficial in forest management activities. Soil carbon may be
reduced slightly immediately following harvest (Laiho et al, 2002, Carter et al, 2002), however,
any losses will be regained as the succeeding forest regrows with accompanying soil organic
matter inputs (Carter et al., 2002). Relative difference in post-harvest effects on soil carbon
between varying harvest intensities are slight and often undetectable (Carter et al., 2002).
Because differences in soil carbon resulting from changes in management are seldom discernible
or long-lived, the significant additional effort of soil sampling on projects on forested lands is not
recommended.
The differences in the effects of clear-cut versus selective-cut harvests on forest ecosystem
carbon stocks (Figure 3.7) has implications for the accuracy and precision of measuring and
monitoring their changes over time. To address this, two alternative methodologies for
monitoring changes in carbon stocks are presented here.
Direct Measurement Method
Where the activity includes clear-cut harvesting, the simplest approach is to install sample plots
and monitor the changes in carbon stocks as described above (sections 3.2-3.4). As shown in
Figure 3.7, there will be periods of carbon accumulation and period of carbon loss resulting in
positive and negative changes in carbon stocks. With a well-designed sampling regime,
remeasurements will reveal shifts of pre-harvest living biomass to the dead wood pool (i.e.
logging slash and collateral mortality), and subsequent decomposition over time, as well as
regrowth, resulting after harvest. Mean total carbon stocks and 95% confidence intervals are
calculated in the same way as for activities on non-forested lands.
Indirect Measurement Method
In situations of selective-cut harvesting, where harvest intensity per hectare is low, the required
number of plots to capture the variation in harvested areas could be so large as to make
measurement neither financially nor practically feasible. In this case it is possible to use targeted
measurements plus the statistics of the relevant logging activity. It is more appropriate to
measure the change in live biomass due to harvesting directly. The change in live biomass
caused by logging is a result of the extraction of timber and damage to residual trees. The
following information is typically required to calculate carbon gains and losses through the
indirect measurement method:
• Total volume removed
• Area damaged per cubic meter removed
• Amount of slash and damage to residual stand per volume removed
• Rate of regrowth in the harvested areas
• Decomposition rates of slash.
The change in carbon stocks using this approach is calculated as:
Δ live biomass C + Δ dead biomass C
