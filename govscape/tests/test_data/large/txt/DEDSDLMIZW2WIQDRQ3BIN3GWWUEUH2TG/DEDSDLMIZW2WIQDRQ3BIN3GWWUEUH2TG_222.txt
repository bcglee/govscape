aThese factors correspond to the values in Table 1.4.
bEstimates based on survey data for the conterminous United States from USDA Forest Service,
Forest Inventory and Analysis Program’s database of forest surveys (FIADB; USDA For. Serv.
2005) and include growing stock on timberland stands classified as medium- or large-diameter
stands. Fractions are based on volumes of growing stock trees.
cTo calculate fraction in hardwood, subtract fraction in softwood from 1.
dSoftwood sawtimber are trees at least 22.9 cm (9 in) d.b.h., hardwood sawtimber is at least 27.9
cm (11 in) d.b.h. To calculate fraction in less-than-sawtimber-size trees, subtract fraction in
sawtimber from 1. Trees less than sawtimber-size are at least 12.7 cm (5 in) d.b.h.
eAverage wood specific gravity is the density of wood divided by the density of water based on
wood dry mass associated with green tree volume.
