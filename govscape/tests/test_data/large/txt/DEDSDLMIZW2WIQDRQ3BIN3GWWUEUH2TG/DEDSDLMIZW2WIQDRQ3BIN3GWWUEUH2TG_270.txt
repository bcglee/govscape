All the discussion in this section has been for an activity with a single stratum. If the activity
contained multiple strata then each would be calculated separately as detailed here. Once the
area-based carbon dioxide equivalents and confidence were calculated for each strata the
numbers could be combined. The new confidence interval for the combined strata would be
estimated as follows:
Total 95% CI = √( [95%CI ]2 + [95%CI ]2 +………. [95%CI ]2 )
s1 s2 sn
Where [95%CI ] = 95% confidence interval for strata 1, strata 2, etc. for all strata measured in
s1
the project.
The methods presented here for calculating uncertainty in reported values are known as “error
propagation”. Error propagation is simple and robust. However, these methods should be used
with caution where:
• Correlations exist between datasets – for example between two carbon pools.
• Uncertainties are very large (greater than 100 %)
In these cases it is statistically more appropriate to use a Monte Carlo analysis10. In practice the
difference in results attained through the two methods are small unless correlations and/or
uncertainties are very high.
10 The principle of Monte Carlo analyses is to perform the summing of uncertainties many times each time with the
uncertain stocks or increments chosen randomly by the computer software from within the distribution of
uncertainties input initially by the user.
These analyses can be carried out using Monte Carlo software such as Simetar, @Risk or Crystal Ball
(www.simetar.com, www.palisade.com/html/risk.asp, www.crystalball.com).
