The separate set of afforestation tables accounts for lower carbon densities of down dead wood,
forest floor, and soil carbon in the initial years after forest establishment on nonforest land.
However, as stands mature, the level of carbon stocks in these pools approaches the regional
averages represented in the reforestation tables.
The tables in Appendices A and B provide estimates of carbon stock. The net change in carbon
stock (sometimes called flux) associated with a growing forest can be determined by dividing the
difference between two carbon stocks by the time interval between them. (See Examples 1.1 and
1.2 for information on using these tables.)

Figure 1.1â€”Definition of regions: Pacific Northwest, West (PWW); Pacific Northwest, East (PWE); Pacific
Southwest (PSW); Rocky Mountain, North (RMN); Rocky Mountain, South (RMS); Northern Prairie States
(NPS); Northern Lake States (NLS); Northeast (NE); South Central (SC); and Southeast (SE). Note that
regions are merged for some tables, these combinations include: NLS and NPS as North Central; PWW,
PWE, and PSW as Pacific Coast; RMN and RMS as Rocky Mountain; SC and SE as South; and RMN, RMS,
PWE, and PSW as West (except where stated otherwise).
1.2.1 Modifications to Forest Ecosystem Tables
The forest ecosystem tables provide regional averages as scenarios of forest growth and carbon
accumulation, but they need not be used as the sole source of information on forest yield or
carbon. For instance, a landowner may independently acquire estimates of growth or carbon
accumulation that are specific to a particular carbon sequestration project. In this case, an
appropriate use of the tables is to combine available data and to selectively use columns of
carbon stocks to fill gaps in information.
