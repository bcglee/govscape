Appendix Section 1: Methods for Calculating Forest Ecosystem and Harvested Carbon,
with Standard Estimates for Forest Types of the United States
The material presented in Appendix Section 1 (this section) is adapted from a USDA Forest
Service General Technical Report (Smith et al. 2006).
1.1 Introduction
International agreements recognize forestry activities as one way to sequester carbon, and thus
mitigate the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; this may slow possible climate change
effects. The United States initiated a voluntary reporting program in the early 1990’s (U.S. Dep.
Energy 2005). A system for developing estimates of the quantity of carbon sequestered in forest
stands and harvested wood products1 throughout the United States is a vital part of the voluntary
program. This system must be relatively easy to use, transparent, economical, and accurate. In
this publication, we present methods and regional average tables that meet these criteria.
Carbon is sequestered in growing trees, principally as wood in the tree bole. However, accrual in
forest ecosystems also depends on the accumulation of carbon in dead wood, litter, and soil
organic matter. When wood is harvested and removed from the forest, not all of the carbon
flows immediately to the atmosphere. In fact, the portion of harvested carbon sequestered in
long-lasting wood products may not be released to the atmosphere for years or even decades. If
carbon remaining in harvested wood products is not part of the accounting system, calculation of
the change in carbon stock for the forest area that is harvested will incorrectly indicate that all
the harvested carbon is released to the atmosphere immediately. Failing to account for carbon in
wood products significantly overestimates emissions to the atmosphere in the year in which the
harvest occurs.
We adopted the approach of Birdsey (1996), who developed tables of forest carbon stocks and
carbon in harvested wood to provide basic information on average carbon change per area. The
tables are commonly referred to as “look-up tables” because users can identify the appropriate
table for their forest, and look up the average regional carbon values for that type of forest. We
have updated the tables by using new inventory surveys, forest carbon and timber projection
models, and a more precise definition of carbon pools. We also include additional forest types
and background information for customizing the tables for a user’s specific needs.
The look-up tables are categorized by region, forest type, previous land use, and, in some cases,
productivity class and management intensity. Users must identify the categories for their forest,
estimate the area of forestland, and, if needed, characterize the amount of wood harvested from
1 Traditionally, the phrase “forest products” includes paper, but the phrase “wood products” does not. The literature
for forest carbon has not recognized this distinction. To be consistent with the literature, documentation relating to
the 1605b program defines “wood products” as, products derived from the harvested wood from a forest, including
fuel-wood and logs and the products derived from them such as cut timber, plywood, wood pulp, paper, etc.
Included are both products in use and in disposal systems such as landfills (but which have not yet decayed,
releasing carbon to the atmosphere as CO and/or CH ).
