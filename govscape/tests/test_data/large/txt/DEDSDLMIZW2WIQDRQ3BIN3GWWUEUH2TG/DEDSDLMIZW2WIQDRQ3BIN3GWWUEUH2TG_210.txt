A set of regional average factors (Tables D8 through D12) is used for the calculations to
transform growing-stock volume to carbon in roundwood, which is then allocated to the expected
disposition of carbon in primary wood products. This land-based approach for calculating the
disposition of carbon in harvested wood products differs from the previously described product-
based approaches in two important respects: the disposition of carbon is expressed as mass per
area of forest rather than as an absolute mass, and additional carbon pools must be considered
such as ecosystem carbon and carbon removed at harvest but not incorporated into wood
products. Calculations can include carbon in roundwood removed as fuelwood as well as carbon
in bark on roundwood. Furthermore, estimates of forest carbon at the time of harvest place
constraints on quantities harvested. For instance, total carbon mass allocated to harvest, as in
Table 1.3, is calculated from volume but is limited to a portion of live tree biomass.
The starting variable for the forest ecosystem calculation is volume at harvest (for example,
172.1 m3/ha in Table 1.3). Carbon in growing-stock volume is allocated to the four categories of
roundwood using the factors in Table 1.4. The first three factors allocate growing stock based on
two separate divisions among trees contributing to stand-level growing-stock volume: first, to
hardwood or softwood types, and second, to sawtimber diameter- or less-than-sawtimber
diameter trees. These factors were developed from the most recent forest inventory data for each
State in the FIADB and are summarized according to region and forest type. Data from the
FIADB were compiled to reflect types and sizes of trees in stands that are likely to be harvested;
thus, trees are classified as growing stock and stands are identified as medium- or large-diameter
(Alerich and others 2005). Finally, volumes of wood are converted to carbon mass according to
the specific gravity of wood. Values for specific gravity (Jenkins and others 2004) were
summarized from the FIADB with the same criteria as the other factors in Table 1.4. Table D8
contains regional averages for the factors in Table 1.4. Thus, the product of growing-stock
volume and the first, second, and fourth columns of factors (in Tables 1.4 or D8) is the average
dry weight of softwood sawtimber in that growing-stock volume. To convert dry weight to
carbon mass, multiply by 0.5.
The next step in the process is to calculate carbon in roundwood from the previously calculated
values of carbon in growing-stock volume. The definition of roundwood is the same as
elsewhere in this text; as such, it excludes bark and the portion of roundwood identified as
fuelwood. Not all roundwood is from growing-stock volume, and not all of growing-stock
volume becomes roundwood. Table 1.5 includes the fraction of growing stock that is roundwood
and the ratio of roundwood to growing-stock volume that is roundwood. These factors are from
Johnson (2001) and are also in Tables D9 and D10. The product of carbon in growing-stock
volume and these two factors from Table 1.5 is the mass of carbon in roundwood for each of the
roundwood categories.
Fuelwood and bark on roundwood are also carbon pools removed from site at harvest. These are
calculated separately because they are not part of the roundwood carbon pool allocated according
to Table 1.6. Fuelwood, as used here, is a portion of total roundwood as defined in Johnson
(2001). For the harvest scenario tables (Appendix C), we assume that carbon from these pools is
emitted the same year as harvest. Thus, the carbon is added to the two emitted categories at the
time of harvest; all of the fuelwood and a portion of the bark on roundwood are emitted with
energy capture. Tables 1.5 and D11 provide ratios of carbon in bark to carbon in wood
summarized according to region. The ratios apply to roundwood logs and are based on biomass
