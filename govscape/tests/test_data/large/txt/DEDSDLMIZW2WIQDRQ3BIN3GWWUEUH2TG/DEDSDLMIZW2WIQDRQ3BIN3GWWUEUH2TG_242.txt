Figure 3.3. An example of how the percent absolute change in mean (with 95% confidence) soil carbon for
afforestation activities varies in relation to the sampling interval and sample size (n), assuming constant
coefficient of variation (30%), constant rate of soil carbon accumulation of 0.5 t C/ha.yr, and initial soil
carbon 50 t/ha.
3.2.4 Frequency of monitoring
The frequency of monitoring is related to the rate and magnitude of change - the smaller the
expected change, the greater the potential that frequent monitoring will not detect a significant
change. That is, frequency of monitoring should be determined by the magnitude of expected
change—less frequent monitoring is applicable if only small changes are expected.
The frequency of monitoring should take into consideration the carbon dynamics of the activity
and costs involved. Given the dynamics of forest processes, they are generally measured over
periods of 5-year intervals (e.g., the US National Forest Inventory). For carbon pools that
respond more slowly such as soil, even longer periods could be used (see section 3.4.4). Thus it
is recommended that for carbon accumulating in the trees, the frequency of measuring and
monitoring should be defined in accordance with the rate of change of the carbon stock, and in
the case of plantations in accordance with the rotation length.
Monitoring only the changes in carbon stocks in the permanent monitoring plots does not
necessarily provide information that the project is accomplishing the same changes in carbon
stocks across the whole area and that the activity is accomplishing what it set out to do—e.g.
plant several thousand hectares of trees. Repeated visits to the carbon monitoring plots will only
show that the carbon in those plots (which were randomly located and purportedly represent the
population) is accumulating carbon with known accuracy and precision. To give confidence that
the overall activity is performing as well as the plots, it is also suggested that, through time,
periodic checks are made using an independent approach. This can be accomplished through
field checking using indicators of carbon stock changes such as tree height for afforestation
activities. Thus entities could produce such indicators that can readily be field-checked across the
area. High resolution remote sensing imagery could also be used to accomplish this task, at least
with respect to area treated. Periodic acquisition of such imagery or even aerial imagery could
be a relatively inexpensive way to monitor overall performance.
