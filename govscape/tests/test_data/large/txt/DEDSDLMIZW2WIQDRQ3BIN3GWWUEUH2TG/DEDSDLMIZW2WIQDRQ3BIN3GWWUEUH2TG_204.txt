production. These steps correspond to Tables 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9, respectively. Total carbon
emissions to the atmosphere for a given year are the difference between the initial quantity of
carbon in primary wood products and the sum of carbon in use or in landfills.
Carbon in primary wood products is based on conversion factors in Table 1.7, which were
computed using data in Table D1. Specific carbon content of wood fiber in solid wood products
(those in Table D1) is 50 percent, and the carbon content of air dry weight paper is 45 percent.
Table D1 includes factors to convert the customary units used for each primary product to a
standard mass and volume for calculating carbon mass of the wood fibers.
The fractions of primary wood products remaining in use for a given number of years after
production in Table 1.8 were developed by first allocating the primary product to a number of
end-uses and then determining the fraction remaining in each end use over time. The allocation
of primary products to end uses is presented in Table D2. The fraction remaining in use over
time is determined using first-order decay functions and the half-lives presented in Table D3.
The fraction of primary products (and thus the fraction of carbon) remaining in use can be
calculated by the following:
[Equation D1]
Fraction of carbon in solid wood products remaining in use in year n
= (fraction used in single family houses) × e (- n×ln(2)/ half-life for sf houses)
+ (fraction used in multifamily houses) × e (- n×ln(2)/ half-life for mf houses)
+ (fraction used in mobile homes) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life mobile homes)
+ (fraction used in repair and alteration) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life repair)
+ (fraction used in nonresidential except railroads) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life non res ex rr)
+ (fraction used in railroad ties) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life rr ties)
+ (fraction used in railroad cars) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life rr cars)
+ (fraction used in household furniture) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life hh furn)
+ (fraction used in commercial furniture) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life com furn)
+ (fraction used in other manufacturing) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life oth manf)
+ (fraction used in wood containers) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life wood cont)
+ (fraction used in pallets) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life pallets)
+ (fraction used in dunnage) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life dunnage)
+ (fraction used in other uses) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life other uses)
+ (fraction used in exports) × e (– n×ln(2)/ half-life exports)
[Equation D2]
Fraction of paper products remaining in use in year n
= e (- n×ln(2)/ half-life for paper)
The fractions of paper in use, as provided in Table 1.8, are based on Equation D2 and the
assumption that some paper is recycled. To include the effects of recycling in these calculations,
the following general assumptions are necessary: an average half-life of paper products, a rate of
paper recovery and recycling, and the efficiency of reuse of paper fibers. We use a half-life of
