Example 1.2 – Obtain an estimate of carbon stock when the value is not explicitly provided
on a table, for stands of maple-beech-birch in the Northeast.
Use Table 1.2 to calculate live tree carbon stock of a stand with volume of wood (growing-stock
volume) of 150 m3/ha. This value is obtained by linearly interpolating between rows 7 and 8 of
Table 1.2. The estimate of live tree carbon is between rows 7 and 8 because 150 m3/ha is also
between those two rows, and live tree carbon is a function of volume (Fig. 1.2).
Linear interpolation identifies a value for carbon stock between 101.1 and 113.1 t/ha that is
linearly proportional to the position of 150 between 146.6 and 172.1 (from rows 7 and 8 of Table
1.2).
Live tree carbon (if volume is 150 m3/ha)
= (150.0 - 146.6) / (172.1 - 146.6) × (113.1 - 101.1) + 101.1
= 0.133 × 12.0 +101.1 = 102.7 t/ha
The value 0.133 means the carbon stock is 13.3 percent of the distance between the two stocks
listed on the table, 101.1 and 113.1 t/ha.
