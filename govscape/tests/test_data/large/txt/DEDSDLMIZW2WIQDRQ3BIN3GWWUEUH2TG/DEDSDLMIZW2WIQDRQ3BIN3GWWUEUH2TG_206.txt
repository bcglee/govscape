1) Initial quantity of carbon in the primary wood product (Table D1, used to make Table
1.7)
2) Amount of this carbon in single-family houses at years 3 and 100 (Equation D1 and
Tables D2 and D3; this is an applications example)
3) Amount of this carbon in use in all end-use products at years 3 and 100 (Equation D1 and
Tables D2 and D3; resulting fractions presented in Table 1.8)
4) Amount of this carbon in landfills from all end-use products at years 3 and 100 (Tables
1.8, D4, and D5; resulting fractions presented in Table 1.9)
Part 1: Initial quantity of carbon, from Table D1:
320,000 ft2 × 31.25 ft3/1,000 ft2 × 35.0 lb/ft2 × 0.95 = 332,500 lb of wood fiber
332,500 lb × 0.5 × (1 short ton / 2000 lb) = 83.13 tons of carbon
332,500 lb × 0.5 × (1 metric ton / 2204.62 lb) = 75.41 t of carbon
Note this is the only table that includes non-metric units.
Part 2: Amount of softwood plywood carbon in single-family houses at years 3 and 100, from
Equation D1 and Tables D2 and D3:
In single-family houses at 3 years
= 75.41 × 0.334 × exp(-3×ln(2)/100) = 24.67 t
In single-family houses at 100 years
= 75.41 × 0.334 × exp(-100×ln(2)/100) = 12.59 t
Part 3: Amount of softwood plywood carbon in use in all end-use products at years 3 and 100,
from Equation D1 and Tables D2 and D3:
Amount of carbon in use at 3 years (showing the 15 terms from Equation D1)
= 75.41 × (0.327 + 0.032 + 0.029 + 0.227 + 0.087 + 0.000 + 0.001 + 0.043 + 0.047 +
0.070 + 0.006 + 0.018 + 0.000 + 0.008 + 0.036) = 75.41 × 0.930 = 70.1 t
Amount of carbon in use at 100 years (showing the 15 terms from Equation D1)
= 75.41 × (0.167 + 0.012 + 0.000 + 0.024 + 0.032 + 0.000 + 0.000 + 0.005 + 0.005 +
0.000 + 0.000 + 0.000 + 0.000 + 0.000 + 0.000) = 75.41 × 0.245 = 18.5 t
Note that the sum of terms from equation D1 is the fraction remaining in use at the end of
a given year. These fractions are calculated and provided in Table 1.8, for example the
fractions 0.930 and 0.245, which are for years 3 and 100, respectively.
Part 4: Amount of carbon in landfills from all end-use products at years 3 and 100, from Tables
1.8, D4, and D5:
Note that the amount of carbon in landfills at the end of year 3 is a sum from material
discarded in each of the years, that is: from year 1, the nondegradable fraction of carbon
discarded in year 1 plus the remaining part of the degradable fraction after two years of
decay; from year 2, the nondegradable fraction of carbon discarded in year 2 plus the
remaining part of the degradable fraction after one year of decay; and from year 3, the
carbon discarded to landfills in year 3.
