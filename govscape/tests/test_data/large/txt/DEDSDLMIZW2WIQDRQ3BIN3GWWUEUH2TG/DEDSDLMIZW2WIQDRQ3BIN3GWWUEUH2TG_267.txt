In this equation the %C must be expressed as a decimal fraction; e.g. 2.2 %C is expressed as
0.022 in the equation. An example of how to calculate carbon in organic soil carbon plots is
given in Box 3.8.
Box 3.8. Calculating mass of soil carbon per unit area
Mass of carbon per unit volume is calculated by multiplying carbon concentration (reported as
percent mass) times bulk density (g/cm3). Bulk density equals the oven dry weight of the soil core
divided by the core volume. For example, a core of volume 94.2 cm3 (1 cm radius x 30 cm length
cylinder) with dry weight 144.06 yields a bulk density of 1.53 g/cm3. Referencing the sample
depth, mass per unit area is calculated, which represents a corresponding volume of soil. Thus,
Volume/hectare = 100 m x 100 m x 0.3 m (sample depth) = 3 x 109 cm3 = 3,000 m3
Mass/hectare = 3 x 109 cm3 x 1.53 g/cm3 (bulk density) = 4.586 x 109 g = 4,586 tons
Part of this volume is of course occupied by tree roots, which are accounted for separately,
however, this fraction tends to be insignificant and for practical purposes is ignored here.
From within the same plot, the corresponding aggregate core analyzed for carbon concentration
yields 0.8 % mass carbon. Mass per unit area, 4,586 t/ha, calculated previously, multiplied times
0.8 % yields equivalent 36.7 tons of soil carbon per hectare. A series of sample calculations of
mass soil carbon are tabulated below.
