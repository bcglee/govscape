Figure 1.3—The transition of carbon in forest trees to end-use products represented by a sequence of distinct
pools separated by processes that move carbon between pools. Calculations of carbon in harvested wood
products may start with any of the first three pools: trees in forests, roundwood, or primary wood products.
1.3.1 Land-based Estimates
The land-based estimates are provided as an additional set of forest ecosystem tables with
harvest scenarios, which provide carbon estimates for harvested wood products over an interval
after harvest (see Table 1.3 and Appendix C). At harvest, a large portion of carbon in tree
biomass is allocated to the harvested wood pools, a second portion is assumed to decay rapidly
after harvest (emitted at harvest), and the remainder stays on site in the forest as down dead
wood or forest floor. The “emitted at harvest” carbon is assumed emitted at site soon after
harvest; this is included to distinguish it from the two products emissions categories, which are
emissions associated with processing, use, or disposal of harvested wood after removal from the
site. Tree biomass allocated to harvested wood is removed from the site for processing, and it is
allocated to the four disposition categories defined in Table1.1. Changes in the allocation of this
pool of harvested carbon among the categories are tracked over an interval of stand growth
following harvest (see columns 10, 11, 12, and 13 of Table 1.3). Note that the harvested
products carbon pools are also quantified as carbon densities, that is, tonnes per unit area (acres
or hectares), because they are derived from land-based carbon densities.
These land-based estimates of carbon in harvested wood need not be limited to the examples in
Table 1.3 or Appendix C. Similar calculations are possible for other harvest quantities, stand
ages, or forest types. Factors for estimating and allocating harvested carbon from the forest
ecosystem tables are included in Tables 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. These are used to calculate the
