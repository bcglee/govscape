3.2.3 Type and number of sampling plots
3.2.3.1 Plot type
For forestry activities, permanent or temporary sampling plots could be used for sampling over
time to estimate changes in the relevant carbon pools. Both methods have advantages and
disadvantages. Permanent sample plots are generally regarded as statistically more efficient for
estimating changes in forest carbon stocks compared with temporary plots because there is high
covariance between observations at successive sampling events (Avery and Burkhart, 1983).
Moreover, permanent plots permit efficient verification, if needed, at relatively low cost: a
verifying organization can find and measure permanent plots at random to verify, in quantitative
terms, the design and implementation of the carbon monitoring plan. Disadvantages of
permanent plots are that their location could be known and they could be treated differently
(such as fertilize, irrigate, etc. to enhance the carbon stocks), and that they could be difficult to
re-locate if the area has significant disturbance over the measurement interval. The advantages
of temporary plots are that they may be established more cost-efficiently to estimate the carbon
stocks of the relevant pools, their location changes at each sampling interval, and they would not
be lost by disturbances. The main disadvantage of temporary plots is related to the precision in
estimating the change in forest carbon stocks. Because individual trees are not tracked (see Clark
et al. 2001 for further discussion), the co-variance term is non-existent and it will be more
difficult to attain the targeted precision level without measuring more plots. Thus any time
advantage gained by using temporary over permanent forest plots may be lost by the need to
install more temporary plots to achieve the targeted precision.
If permanent sample plots are used, marking or mapping the trees to measure the growth of
individuals at each time interval is recommended so that growth of survivors, mortality, and
ingrowth of new trees can be tracked. Changes in carbon stocks for each tree are then estimated
and summed per plot. Statistical analyses are then performed on net carbon accumulation per
plot, including ingrowth and losses due to mortality. Because the permanent plots also track
mortality, they can be used to track the major changes in dead wood (both lying and standing)
after the initial inventory of this component.
3.2.3.2 Number of plots
The level of precision required for a carbon inventory has a direct effect on inventory costs and
needs to be carefully chosen by those who will use the inventory results. As mentioned above,
from past experience with forest carbon measurement of projects (e.g. Brown 2002), a
reasonable estimate of the net change in carbon stocks that can be achieved at a reasonable cost
is to within 10% of the true value of the mean at the 95% confidence level.
Once the level of precision has been decided upon, sample sizes must be determined for each
stratum in the project area. Each carbon pool may have a different variance (amount of variation
around the mean). However, experience has shown that focusing on the variance of the tree
component for forestry activities captures most of the variance. Although the variance in other
pools may be high, they often are a small contribution to the net change in carbon stocks or can
actually decrease the total variance when the net change in all pools is estimated. For example,
understory in forests can be quite variable but it is generally a very small component of the net
