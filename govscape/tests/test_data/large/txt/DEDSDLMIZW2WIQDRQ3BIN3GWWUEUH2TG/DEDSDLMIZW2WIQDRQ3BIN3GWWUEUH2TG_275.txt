3.6.1. QA/QC for field measurements
Collecting reliable field measurements is an important step in the quality assurance plan. Those
responsible for the carbon measurement work should be fully trained in all aspects of field data
collection and data analyses. Experience has shown that it is wise for the entity involved with
measuring and monitoring prepare Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for each step of the
field carbon measurements which should be adhered to at all times. These SOPs should detail all
phases of the field measurements so that future personnel can repeat the measurements
identically to previous times. It is recommended that a document be produced and filed with the
project documents that show that QA/QC steps have been followed.
Field crews should receive extensive training and should be fully cognizant of all procedures and
the importance of collecting data as accurately as possible. In addition, an audit program for field
measurements and sampling should be established to check data collection. A typical audit
program consists of three types of checks. During a hot check, auditors observe field crew
members during data collection on a field plot. Cold checks occur where the field crews are not
present for the audit. Finally blind checks represent the complete remeasurement of a plot by the
auditors. Hot checks permit the correction of errors in techniques. Measurement variance can be
calculated through blind checks. At the end of the fieldwork 10-20 % of the plots should be
checked independently. Field data collected at this stage can be compared with the original data.
Any errors found should be corrected and recorded. Any errors discovered could be expressed as
a percentage of all plots that have been rechecked to provide an estimate of the measurement
error.
3.6.2 QA/QC for laboratory measurements
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should also be prepared by the operating entity and
followed for each part of the analyses. Typical steps for the SOP for laboratory measurements
include calibration of combustion instruments for measuring total C or C forms using
commercially-available certified C standards. Likewise all balances for measuring dry weights
should periodically be calibrated against known weights, for fine scale balances this is most
accurately carried out by the manufacturer. Where possible 10-20 % of samples could be
reanalyzed/reweighed to produce an error estimate. Professional laboratories typically perform
these steps, and if such a lab is used such records need to be obtained by the entity.
3.6.3 QA/QC for data entry
To produce reliable carbon estimates, the proper entry of data into the data analyses spreadsheets
is required (this step may be redundant if the field data are collected in an electronic format). It
is important that steps are taken to ensure that errors are minimized. Common sense should be
used when reviewing the results of the data analysis to make sure that they fit within the realm of
reality. Communication between all personnel involved in measuring and analyzing data should
be used to resolve any apparent anomalies before final analysis of the monitoring data can be
