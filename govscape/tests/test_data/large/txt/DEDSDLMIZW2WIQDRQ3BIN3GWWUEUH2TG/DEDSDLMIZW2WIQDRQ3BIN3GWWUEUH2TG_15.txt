1.5 Uncertainty
Estimates of carbon stocks and stock changes are based on regional averages and reflect the
current best available data for developing regional estimates. Quantitative expressions of
uncertainty are not available for most data summaries, coefficients, or model results presented in
the tables. However, uncertainty analyses were developed for previous similar estimates of
carbon, from which our tables were developed (Heath and Smith 2000, Skog and others 2004,
Smith and Heath 2005). Similar quantitative uncertainty analyses are being developed for these
estimates of carbon stocks and stock changes in forests and harvested wood products.
Precision is partly dependent on the scale of the forest carbon sequestration project of interest.
Overall, precision is expected to be lower as these methods are applied to smaller scale projects
versus with regional summaries. That is, precision depends on the degree of specificity in
information about a particular forest or project. It may be useful to distinguish between two
basic components of uncertainty in the application of these tables. Uncertainty about the regional
averages, which are based on data summaries or models, can influence estimates for specific
projects, which generally are small subsets of a region. However, variability within region likely
will have a much greater influence on uncertainty than regional values. This is shown in Figure
1.4, which is an example of the volume-to-biomass relationships used to estimate tree carbon
from merchantable volume (columns 2 and 3 in Table 1.2). Each point represents an individual
permanent FIA inventory plot where the 95-percent confidence interval about the mean of
carbon in live trees is generally less than 5 percent of the mean. The regression line represents
the regional average; the 95-percent confidence intervals about this mean are indicated in Table
1.10. These two relative intervals reflect regional variability in biomass relative to volume. For
example, the 99th percentile of stand growing-stock volumes for this forest in the FIADB is 361
m3/ha and the mean carbon density for these plots is likely between 192 and 197 t/ha (Figure 1.4,
Â±1.4 percent of the expected 194 t/ha). The distinction between uncertainty about coefficients
and regional or temporal variability may also apply to calculating the disposition of carbon in
harvested wood products as well. Uncertainty about the actual allocation of roundwood to
primary products may not be as important as year-to-year change or how activity at a single mill
compares with the region as a whole.
