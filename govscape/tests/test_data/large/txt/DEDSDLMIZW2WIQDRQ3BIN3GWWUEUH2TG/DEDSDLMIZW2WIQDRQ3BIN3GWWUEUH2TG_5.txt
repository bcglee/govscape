Users must have a general understanding of the relationships between the columns of the table to
most appropriately substitute site-specific information for a carbon pool. Some columns can be
viewed as independent or dependent variables, depending on the carbon pool of interest. If new
data are incorporated in a table, any dependent columns (carbon pools) probably will require
minor adjustments (recalculations). Figure 1.2 illustrates the basic relationships underlying
calculations of carbon stock. Stand age and growing-stock volume are from the ATLAS model
and based on FIA data such that they reflect region, forest type, and typical forest management
regimes. Pools of live and standing-dead tree carbon are estimated directly from growing-stock
volume. Carbon stocks of understory or down dead wood are estimated directly from live tree
carbon and are only indirectly affected by growing-stock volume.
Growing-stock volume (stand volume in Figure 1.2) is the merchantable volume of wood in live
trees as defined by FIA (Smith and others 2004c, Alerich and others 2005). Briefly, trees
contributing volume to this stand-level summary value are commercial species that meet
specified standards of size and quality or vigor. Users with other volume estimates for their
stands must consider how to translate the volumes to be consistent with growing-stock volume.
Thus, a landowner interested in applying these carbon estimates to another growth table should
link tree carbon from the tables presented here to the new (separately obtained) estimates of
growing-stock volume rather than to stand age (see Example 1.3). The methods section further
explains how to use selected carbon pools from the table.
1.3 Tables for Harvested Wood Products Carbon
Harvested wood products serve as reservoirs of carbon that are not immediately emitted to the
atmosphere at the time of harvest. The amount of carbon sequestered in products depends on
how much wood is harvested and removed from the forest, to what products the harvested wood
is allocated, and the half-life of wood in these products (Row and Phelps 1996, Skog and others
2004). The central focus of the carbon in harvested wood products estimates is the carbon
change from two pools: carbon in products in use and carbon in landfills. Carbon in harvested
wood is initially processed or manufactured into primary wood products, such as lumber and
paper. These are then incorporated into end-use products, such as houses and newspapers. Intact
primary and end-use products are considered “in use” until they are discarded, and a portion of
these discarded products go to landfills. Additionally, a portion of carbon initially sequestered as
products is eventually returned to the atmosphere through mechanisms such as combustion and
decay. This emitted carbon is classified according to whether it occurred through a process of
combustion with some concomitant energy recapture. This distinction between the two paths for
carbon emitted to the atmosphere is included to assess potential displacement of other fuel
sources. The four categories for the disposition of carbon in harvested wood are defined in Table
1.1. Note that the carbon in the four categories sum to 100 percent of the carbon harvested and
removed from the forest.
