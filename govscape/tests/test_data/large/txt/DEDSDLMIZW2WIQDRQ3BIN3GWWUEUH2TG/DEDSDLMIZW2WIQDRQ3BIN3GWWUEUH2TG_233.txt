decrease must be measured and monitored. Pools that are expected to increase by a small amount
may not need to be estimated if costs are high relative to the magnitude of the increase. For
example, understory herbaceous vegetation in the case of afforestation is rarely a significant
factor in the ecosystem carbon budget.
This section focuses on forest ecosystem carbon only, and includes only the carbon pools
existing on the land (e.g., live and dead above and below ground biomass and soil; see section
2.1 in Technical Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Chapter 1, Section I);
it does not include methods for wood products that are addressed elsewhere in this report.
Experience has shown that the following steps are needed in any protocol to produce credible
and transparent estimates of net changes in carbon stocks:
• Designing a monitoring plan, including delineation of boundaries, stratification of project
area, type and number of sample plots, and frequency of monitoring
• Sampling procedures for the carbon stocks
• Methods of estimating the carbon stocks and techniques to analyse the results
• Methods for estimating the net change in carbon stocks
• Development of a quality assurance and quality control plan
The details of how to implement each of these steps and processes are described next. The focus
of these guidelines is on field measurements designed to produce accurate net changes in carbon
stocks to known levels of precision. A suggested target for the accuracy and precision for forest
carbon accounting is to obtain an estimate that is within 10 percent of the true value, with 95
percent confidence that the estimate lies within these bounds (see section 2.6.4 in Technical
Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Chapter 1, Section I). A measurement
system with this level of precision will result in a rating of “A” under the reporting guidelines for
the 1605(b) program. If the level of precision is within 20 percent of the true value, with 95%
confidence, the rating under 1605(b) will be “B”.
Entities involved with the forest sector generally have good records on types of management,
timber stock, harvest rates, and other information for their different land areas. Such records
could be readily used to develop estimates of net changes in carbon stocks from their forest
activities (details of approaches are included in section 3.2 below). For other entities where such
data are not available (e.g. for non-industrial forest land owners), there are a variety of national
to regional databases, readily downloadable from the internet, that could be used to estimate
changes in carbon stocks on their lands (Box 3.1). Although using such data are likely to result
in less accurate and less precise changes in carbon stocks than estimates based on field
measurements, when such data are used in combination with the methods described in this report
they can provide, with a modest effort, estimates superior to those based on default values alone.
The sources in Box 3.1 are also useful for verifying that measurements and calculations made by
an entity are within the ranges reported at national and regional scales.
