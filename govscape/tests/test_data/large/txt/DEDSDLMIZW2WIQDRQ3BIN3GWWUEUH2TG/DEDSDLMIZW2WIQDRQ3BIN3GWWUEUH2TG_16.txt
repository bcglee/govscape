Figure 1.4â€”A component of uncertainty associated with representing an average forest stand in the
ecosystem tables. Individual points represent live tree carbon density for FIA permanent inventory plots for
maple-beech-birch forests for the Northeast; the line represents carbon in tree biomass as predicted by
growing-stock volume as used in Tables 1.2 and 1.3.
1.6 Conclusions
Summing the two estimates, forest ecosystem carbon and carbon in harvested wood products,
gives the total effect of forest carbon sequestration for an activity. To assure accuracy,
conducting modest inventories will help show the adequacy of the tables in characterizing carbon
sequestration.
Carbon estimates depend on available data. Tables of average values cannot perfectly replicate
each individual stand. Growth and yield information applicable to a particular stand can provide
greater precision than regional averages. Similarly, carbon stocks in wood products that are
calculated from quantities of primary wood products are likely to be more precise than products
calculations starting simply from area of forest. However, the link between forest and
sequestration in products may be less clear when starting from primary wood products. Forest
composition, site conditions, and climate differ by regions, and climate, timber markets, and
forest management priorities are subject to change from year to year. The methods described in
this publication are most useful in identifying a general expected magnitude of carbon in forests,
and to help plan carbon sequestration projects to achieve a certain goal.
