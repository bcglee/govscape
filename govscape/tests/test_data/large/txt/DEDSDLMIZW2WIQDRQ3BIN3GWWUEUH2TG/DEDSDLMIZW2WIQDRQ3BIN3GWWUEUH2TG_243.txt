3.3 Sampling Design
3.3.1 Plot layout
Permanent plot locations can be selected either randomly or systematically. If stratified random
sampling is used, sample units for each stratum can still be selected systematically. If little is
known about the population being sampled, random selection of sample units is generally safer
than systematic selection; however this would depend on the area and type of activity. If plot
values are distributed irregularly in a random pattern, then both approaches are about equally
precise. If some parts of the strata have higher carbon content than others, systematic selection
will usually result in greater precision than random selection.
For some areas, it may not be possible to pre-stratify because from all the usual characteristics,
the site appears to be homogeneous. However, it is possible that after the first monitoring event,
for example, the change in carbon stocks is highly variable and that on further analysis the
measurements can be grouped into like classesâ€”in other words can be post-stratified.
3.2 Size and shape of sample plots
The size and shape of the sample plots is a trade-off between accuracy, precision, and time (cost)
of measurement. Experience has shown that sample plots containing smaller sub-units of various
shapes and sizes, depending on the variables to be measured, are cost efficient. For instance, for
afforestation, all trees are measured in the entire sample plot, whereas non-tree vegetation, litter
and soil data are collected in a smaller area known as a sub-plot. The FIA standard plot is
comprised of a cluster of four subplots of relatively small radius. The monitoring system could
use this design or a series of nested plots as described next.
Nested plots for recording discrete size classes of stems and/or select forest components are a
practical design for sampling and are better suited than fixed-area plots for stands with a wide
range of tree diameters or for stands with changing diameters and stem densities that take place
over time (Figure 3.4). Optimum area for nested plots can be anticipated by predicting changes
in stem density and mean stem diameter over time, or by direct measurements of proxy stands of
known age. It is likely that individual trees in even-aged stands will grow at different rates
resulting in uneven size distribution, and trees will occur in all nested plots in later years of
measurements. However, when the forest is likely to remain evenly sized, a single plot would
suffice.
Nested plots are composed of several (typically 2 to 4, depending upon forest structure) full
circular plots and each of the nested circles should be viewed separately. When trees attain the
minimum size for one of the nested circles they are measured and included, and when they
exceed the maximum size, measurement of that tree in that nest stops and begins in the next
larger nest. If ingrowth into a new nest occurs between measurements, the growth up to the
maximum size is included with the smaller nest, and growth in excess of this size is accounted in
the larger nest (see Box 3.4 in section 3.4.1.1).
