-- = no hardwood trees in this type in this region.
aEstimates based on survey data for the conterminous United States from USDA Forest Service,
Forest Inventory and Analysis Program’s database of forest surveys (FIADB; USDA For. Serv.
2005) and include growing stock on timberland stands classified as medium- or large-diameter
stands. Proportions are based on volume of growing-stock trees.
bTo calculate fraction in hardwood, subtract fraction in softwood from 1.
cSoftwood sawtimber are trees at least 22.9 cm (9 in) d.b.h., hardwood sawtimber is at least 27.9 cm
(11 in) d.b.h. To calculate fraction in less-than-sawtimber-size trees, subtract fraction in sawtimber
from 1. Trees less than sawtimber-size are at least 12.7 cm (5 in) d.b.h.
dAverage wood specific gravity is the density of wood divided by the density of water based on
wood dry mass associated with green tree volume.
eWest represents an average over all western regions for these forest types.
