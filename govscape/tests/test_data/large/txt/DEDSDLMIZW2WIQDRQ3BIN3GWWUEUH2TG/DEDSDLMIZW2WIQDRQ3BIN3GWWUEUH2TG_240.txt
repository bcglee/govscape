Box 3.3: Using FIA Data to Estimate Coefficient of Variation and Number of Sampling Plots
• Download data and apply biomass equations and expansion factors (see section 3.4.1) for the
specific area and forest type of interest. Sum to give plot level results.
• Take means across the dataset or optionally across strata of interest, then calculate standard
deviation and the coefficient of variation.
• The minimum number of plots required for monitoring is calculated by solving for n in the
formula for the confidence interval (CI). Target ±7-8 % of the mean as a reasonable level of
error (this gives the sampling error only; sources of error such as measurement error and
model error are likely to account for between 10-20% of total error, thus a target of ±7-8% CI
of the mean for sampling will result in a total error for the confidence interval of about 10%
of the mean).
n = (s x 1.960)/(mean x 0.08)2 (where s = standard deviation)
The 95 % CI becomes the ±8 % error chosen as a reasonable measurement error level—we
can be 95 % sure that the true mean is covered by the determined measurement error.
• If the activity is planned to run for 50 – 70 years, use the large FIA size class (one method of
sorting the FIA data) where variation and consequently minimum number of plots is low.
(Variation is highest in young or small size class plots regardless of whether regeneration was
natural or artificial).
• Minimum number of plots may be decreased by stratification of study area according to, for
example, slope, soil type, or site index.
