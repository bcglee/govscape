carbon within the sample. General guidance on sampling and analyzing forest and agricultural
soils for estimating carbon stocks can be found in Lal et al. (2001) and Robertson et al. (1999).
Tracking changes in soil carbon over time requires that the same equivalent mass of soil is
measured from one monitoring event to another. Sampling to a fixed depth (equal volumes) can
result in underestimation of carbon gains via forestation because as the bulk density generally
decreases over time, the same sampled volume contains less of the original soil mass equivalent.
Rates of accrual estimated from sampling to a fixed depth should therefore be considered
conservative estimates of soil carbon accretion.
Sampling to greater depth, in cases where there are no additions of new carbon at greater depth,
reduces the detectability of change by diluting additions that take place in the upper layers of the
soil column. Richter et al. (1999), monitoring 35 years of forest regrowth of loblolly pine in the
Calhoun Experimental Forest in South Carolina, found no significant increase in soil carbon
below 7.5 cm depth. Likewise, Markewitz et al. (2002), contrasting formerly cultivated and
never-tilled sites under longleaf pine, found the most notable carbon difference in the upper 10
cm of soil. As hardwood leaf litter is likely to break down and become incorporated into the soil
more quickly, and hardwood trees typically produce more roots than pines, inputs of soil carbon
are expected to a greater depth, to 40 or 50 centimeters (MacDonald, 1999, Winrock,
unpublished data, Figure 3.6).

The forest floor is sampled as described above, exposing the top of the mineral or organic soil. In
some soils, telling the difference between the bottom of the forest floor and the top of the mineral
soil can be difficult. In those cases, one can refer to standard soil sampling methods (e.g. in
Robertson et al. 1999) for tips on how to distinguish the top of mineral soil. Coring tools and
liners to hold the soil cores of varying lengths are commercially available, but it is often
impractical to use the manually-operated impact-driven soil-coring tool below about 30 cm.
