When using allometric equations, the given maximum diameter used in the regression should be
carefully observed. Using the equations for trees that exceed the maximum diameters should
only be done after careful consideration of the functional form of the equation. In particular,
caution should be used with equations that are based on an exponential function (e.g. the
equations in Table 3.3). Equations using a more sigmoidal form, where biomass is constrained at
large diameters, are more stable and can be more safely used even beyond the given maximum
bounds (Brown et al. 1989). Table 3.4 lists the general equations of Schroeder et al. (1997) and
Brown and Schroeder (1999) which have this sigmoidal/constrained form. Figure 3.4 compares
the estimated biomass per tree for a given diameter based on the exponential and sigmoidal
models. Up to about 75 cm diameter the models give the same estimated biomass per tree but
beyond this point the exponential models result in an increasingly larger and larger estimated
biomass whereas the sigmoidal model is more conservative.

Figure 3.4. A comparison of the relative treatment of large trees by equations with an exponential form (e.g.
the hard maple/oak/hickory/beech equation; Table 3.3) and those with a limiting function (e.g. the eastern
hardwoods equation; Table 3.4).
In addition the equations of Jenkins et al. (2003), while an exhaustive coverage of the US tree
flora, are dominated by western species in the softwood category. Western softwoods are unique
with regard to stature and consequently do not well represent southern pines or eastern fir-spruce
species. In contrast the equations for pines and fir-spruce of Brown and Schroeder (1999, Table
3.4) are calculated specifically for these groups of species.
