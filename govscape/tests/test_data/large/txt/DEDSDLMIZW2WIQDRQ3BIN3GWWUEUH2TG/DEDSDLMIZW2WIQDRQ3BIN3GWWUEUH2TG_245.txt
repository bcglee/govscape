3.3.3 Selection of carbon pools to measure and monitor
The selection of which pools to measure and monitor depends on several factors, including
expected rate of change, magnitude and direction of change, availability and accuracy of
methods to quantify change, and cost to measure. All pools that are expected to decrease as a
result of activities must be measured and monitored. Pools that are expected to increase by a
small amount relative to the overall rate of change need not be measured and monitored, for
example, understory herbaceous vegetation in the case of an afforestation project. The decision
matrix shown in Table 3.2 presents the main carbon pools for forests and which ones should (Y),
maybe (M), or should not (N) be measured for each forestry activity type.
Clearly it makes sense to measure and monitor the carbon pool in live trees and their roots for all
activity types. Aboveground non-tree live carbon (or understory) may need measuring if this is a
significant component, such as where shrubs are present in large numbers; it may not need
measuring if the understory is dominated by herbaceous material as this is likely to account for
very small changes over the duration of the activity (less than three percent). It is recommended
that forest floor be measured in most activity types, especially where the forest is likely to be
dominated by conifers, as this can be a significant component of the total carbon pool. Dead
wood is composed of standing dead trees and downed dead wood. For changes in management
for timber, this must be measured as this pool often decreases as a result of a projectâ€”e.g., a
change from more intensive harvesting to less intensive harvesting will cause the dead wood
pool to decrease (less timber is removed and less slash is left behind). Soil organic carbon is
likely to change significantly for afforestation, forest restoration, and mine land reclamation
activities as the initial condition of soil is likely to be low in carbon. However changes in forest
management or even forest preservation (from harvesting to preservation) are likely to produce
very small to no changes in soil carbon and the cost to measure this pool could exceed the value
of the carbon. The decision to monitor wood products depends on whether the project area will
ultimately be harvested or not (see section 4.6 in Technical Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting
of Greenhouse Gases, Chapter 1, Section I). For short rotation biomass energy plantations this
would be necessary as the product is the main purpose of the activity. Activities related to
changes in forest management need also to measure and monitor wood products as often this
reduces the change in the live carbon pool; likewise for forest preservation if the original activity
