Figure 1.2—Graphs indicating the basic relationships between the components of the forest ecosystem carbon
tables. Figures are not drawn to scale; numerical representation for each graph is available from the tables.
Dashed lines are qualitative representation of where afforestation tables (Appendix B) differ from the
reforestation tables (Appendix A). Note that stand volume refers to growing-stock volume of live trees.
The path that transforms trees-in-forests to wood-in-products can be described by the diagram in
Figure 1.3. Quantities defined for the first three boxes in the diagram can serve as starting
points, or data sources, for determining the disposition of carbon in wood products. Consistent
with this, we provide factors for starting calculations of carbon in harvested wood products on
the bases of forestland, the amount of industrial roundwood harvested, or the quantity of primary
wood products produced by mills, depending on the data available (see definitions and details in
the methods section). The forestland, or land-based, estimates are an extension of the forest
ecosystem tables presented above. The other two starting points can be classified as product-
based calculations, which are based on harvested logs or the output of mills. It is important to
note that calculations from all three starting points (Fig. 1.3) focus on the same quantities of
products in use or in landfills, and they all rely on the same model of allocation and longevity of
end uses. They differ only in the level of detail available as the principal source of information
on harvested wood – the path from input data to final disposition (Fig. 1.3). In the methods
section, we provide the interrelated methods for calculating carbon in harvested wood for each of
