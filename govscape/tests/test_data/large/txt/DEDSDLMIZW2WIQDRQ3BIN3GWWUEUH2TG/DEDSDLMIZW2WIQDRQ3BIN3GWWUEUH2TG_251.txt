Box 3.4. Calculating the carbon stock and its change in aboveground trees from allometric
regression equations
As a hypothetical example, a single plot from oak/hickory forest will be examined. The plot
consists of three nested subplots:
• 5 m radius for trees measuring 2.5 to < 10 cm dbh
• 14 m radius for trees ≥ 10 to < 50 cm dbh
• 20 m radius for trees ≥ 50 cm dbh
The allometric regression equation of Jenkins et al. (2003) is used for hard
maple/oak/hickory/beech to convert from diameter at breast height (dbh) to biomass.
The figure and table below show measurements over two time periods. Note the following: at
time 2, ingrowth of trees too small to be measured at time 1 (trees 101 and 102 in the small nest
and 103 in the intermediate nest) and outgrowth from one plot size and ingrowth into the next
size when the max/min thresholds are passed (trees 004, 005 small to intermediate, tree 009
intermediate to large).

The three nested plots at time 1 and time 2. The stars indicate the position of trees. At time 2, black stars
indicate trees that remained in the same size class as at time 1. Grey stars indicate trees that have grown into
the next class and white stars are trees that have exceeded the measurement minimum for that plot for the
first time.
