3.2 Monitoring Design
3.2.1 Boundaries
Forestry activities and the land base for an entity can vary in size (from tens of hectares to up to
hundreds of thousands of hectares) and can be confined to a single or several geographic areas.
The area may be one contiguous block of land having a single owner or many small blocks of
land spread over a wide area having a large number of small or a few large landowners. The
spatial boundaries of the land need to be clearly defined to facilitate accurate measuring,
monitoring, accounting, and verification. The spatial boundaries can be in the form of permanent
boundary markers (e.g., fences), clearly defined topographic descriptions (e.g., rivers/creeks,
mountain ridges), spatially explicit located boundaries (identified with a Global Positioning
system (GPS)), and/or other methods. Ground-based surveys that delineate property boundaries
are an accurate means of documenting land boundaries. There are many different methods and
tools that can be employed to identify and delineate land boundaries, including remote sensing
(e.g., satellite imageries from optical or radar sensor systems, aerial photos), GPS, topographic
maps, and land records. Larger areas across the landscape can be defined through specific
boundary descriptions using GPS-based coordinates on topographic maps or other suitable
means.
Boundaries need to be properly documented from the start (mapped and described) and should
preferably not be subject to any changes through the duration of the estimation period. In the
event that boundary changes take place, these would need to be reported and inclusions and/or
exclusions of physical land area need to be surveyed using the above described methods (this
would mean adjusting the estimated net emissions or removals of greenhouse gases attributable
to the activity or entity).
3.2.2 Stratification of land area
Once the land area has been delineated, it is useful to collect basic background information such
as land-use history and maps of soil, vegetation, and topography. The land for the project or
entity can be geo-referenced and mapped onto a base map. A geographic information system
(GIS) would be useful for such an activity. Such maps can then be used to stratify the area into
more or less homogeneous units to increase the efficiency of sampling.
To facilitate the field work and increase the accuracy and precision of measuring and monitoring,
it is useful to divide the area (population of interest) into sub-populations or strata that form
relatively homogenous units. Useful tools for defining strata include ground-truthed maps from
satellite imagery (Box 3.2), aerial photographs, and maps of vegetation, soils or topography.
Many of these products are available as GIS data layers (e.g., STATSGO soil maps, USGS
Digital Elevation Model, 1992 National Land Cover map) that can be overlain in a GIS to
identify possible strata. The key to useful stratification is to ensure that measurements are more
alike within each stratum than in the sample frame as a whole. A geographic information system
(GIS) can automatically determine stratum size and the size of exclusions or buffer zones.
The size and spatial distribution of the land area does not influence site stratification â€“ one large
contiguous block of land or many small parcels are considered the population of interest and are
