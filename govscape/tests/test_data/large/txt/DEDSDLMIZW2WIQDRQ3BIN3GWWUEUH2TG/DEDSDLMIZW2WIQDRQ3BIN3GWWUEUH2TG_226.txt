aValues and classifications are based on data in Tables 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, and 6.2 of Johnson
(2001).
bRatios are calculated for roundwood after deducting fuelwood and are based on volumes. The
denominators are portions of growing-stock volume according to wood type and size.
Numerators for “less than sawtimber-size” include poletimber and nongrowing-stock sources.
We assume the ratios do not include bark and use these values as a step in determining the
allocation of carbon for Table 1.5 and Appendix C, based on growing stock.
cNorth Central includes the Northern Prairie States and the Northern Lake States; Pacific Coast
includes the Pacific Northwest (West and East) and the Pacific Southwest; Rocky Mountain
includes Rocky Mountain, North and South; and South includes the Southeast and South
Central.
