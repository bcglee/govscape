Example 1.4 – Calculate carbon in harvested wood products remaining in use at 15 years
after harvest based on volume of growing stock at time of harvest
Starting with an example from the Pacific Northwest, we will calculate the disposition of carbon
in harvested wood products that are still in use at 15 years after harvest from the Douglas-fir
forest described in Table C12. More specifically, we will show the steps involved to calculate
that 53.3 t/ha of harvested carbon are in use at 15 years after harvest, starting from a harvested
growing-stock volume of 718.8 m3/ha (Table C12). We use factors from Tables 1.4, 1.5, and
1.6. These calculations are land-based estimates of carbon in harvested wood products based on
the “trees in forests” starting point identified in Figure 1.3. Additional details on expanding
these calculations to other harvested wood categories within the table or to other forest types are
in Appendix D.
The sequence of steps required to determine carbon in use at year 15 are: 1) convert growing-
stock volume to carbon mass according to four categories; 2) convert carbon in growing stock to
carbon in roundwood; and 3) determine carbon remaining in products at the appropriate year.
Step 1: We assume that an average harvest for a forest type group produces roundwood logs that
can be classified as softwood or hardwood as well as saw logs and pulpwood. The conversion
from volume of wood to carbon mass depends on the specific carbon content of wood. Factors
in Table 1.4 are used to allocate the 718.8 m3/ha of growing-stock volume to four pools of
carbon. For example, carbon in the softwood saw log part of growing-stock volume is the
product of: growing-stock volume, the softwood fraction of growing-stock volume, the saw log
fraction of softwood, softwood specific gravity, and the carbon fraction of wood fiber (0.5). The
calculations from Table 1.4 are:
Softwood saw log carbon in growing-stock volume
= 718.8 × 0.959 × 0.914 × 0.440 × 0.5 = 138.61 t/ha
Softwood pulpwood carbon in growing-stock volume
= 718.8 × 0. 959 × (1 – 0.914) × 0.440 × 0.5 = 13.04 t/ha
Hardwood saw log carbon in growing-stock volume
= 718.8 × (1 – 0.959) × 0.415 × 0.426 × 0.5 = 2.61 t/ha
Hardwood pulpwood carbon in growing-stock volume
= 718.8 × (1 – 0.959) × (1 – 0.415) × 0.426 × 0.5 = 3.67 t/ha
Thus, total carbon stock in 718.8 m3/ha of growing-stock volume is 183.60 t/ha.
Step 2: We need to represent carbon in these four categories in terms of carbon in roundwood,
which excludes bark and fuelwod. However, not all growing-stock volume becomes roundwood,
and some roundwood is from non-growing stock sources. Factors in Table 1.5 are used to obtain
carbon in roundwood. For example, carbon in roundwood is the product of: carbon in growing-
stock volume, the fraction of growing-stock volume that is roundwood, and the ratio of
roundwood to growing-stock volume that is roundwood. The calculations from Table 1.5 are:
Softwood saw log carbon in roundwood = 138.61 × 0.929 × 0.965 = 124.26 t/ha
Softwood pulpwood carbon in roundwood = 13.04 × 0.929 × 1.099 = 13.31 t/ha
Hardwood saw log carbon in roundwood = 2.61 × 0.947 × 0.721 = 1.78 t/ha
Hardwood pulpwood carbon in roundwood = 3.67 × 0.947 × 0.324 = 1.13 t/ha
