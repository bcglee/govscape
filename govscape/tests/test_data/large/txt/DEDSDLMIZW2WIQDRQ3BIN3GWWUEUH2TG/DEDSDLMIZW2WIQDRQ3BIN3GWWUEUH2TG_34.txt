North Central includes the Northern Prairie States and the Northern Lake States; Pacific Coast includes
the Pacific Northwest (West and East) and the Pacific Southwest; Rocky Mountain includes Rocky
Mountain, North and South; and South includes the Southeast and South Central.
b
Values and classifications are based on data in Tables 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, and 6.2 of Johnson (2001).
c
Ratios are calculated from carbon mass based on biomass component equations in Jenkins and others
(2003) applied to all live trees identified as growing stock on timberland stands classified as medium- or
large-diameter stands in the survey data for the conterminous United States from USDA Forest Service,
Forest Inventory and Analysis Program’s database of forest surveys (FIADB; USDA For. Serv. 2005,
Alerich and others 2005). Carbon mass is calculated for boles from stump to 4-inch top, outside
diameter.
d
Values and classifications are based on data in Tables 2.9, 3.9, 4.9, 5.9, and 6.9 of Johnson (2001).
