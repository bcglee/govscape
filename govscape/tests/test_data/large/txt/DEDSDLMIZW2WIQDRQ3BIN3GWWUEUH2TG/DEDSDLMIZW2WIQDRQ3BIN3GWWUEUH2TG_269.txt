Soils, forest floor and non-tree vegetation are calculated separately as the statistics, number of
sampling plots and even the sampling interval may be different than for the other components.
The results from these measurements are analyzed to produce an estimate of the mean and the
95% confidence interval. This estimate is then added to create a system level mean and 95%
confidence interval. The total confidence interval is calculated as follows:
Total 95% CI = √( [95%CI ]2 + [95%CI ]2 + [95%CI ]2 +[95%CI ]2 )

Where [95%CI ] = 95% confidence interval for vegetation, [95%CI ] = 95% confidence

interval for soil etc.
If part of the afforested area is harvested, the sampling plots would theoretically monitor the
change in live and dead biomass. However, they would not monitor the amount going into wood
products. As mentioned above, the reason wood products need to be considered is that the
decrease in live biomass from harvesting does not mean that the equivalent amount of carbon
went into the atmosphere—some of it could go into long-lived wood products. Thus to correctly
estimate the effects of harvesting on the net change in carbon stocks, the amount of wood
biomass going into long-term wood products is needed. This quantity per unit area and its
estimated 95 % confidence interval would then be added to the total change. An example of the
integration of all the components from permanent plots is given in Box 3.9, where the initial
carbon stocks are of agricultural crop.
If temporary plots are employed to measure changes in carbon stocks, the mean and 95%
confidence interval of the carbon stock in each component across all plots is calculated at time 1
and time 2. The total carbon stock at each time interval is then estimated by summing the means
for each component and the total error is estimated as follows:
Total 95% CI = √( [95%CI ]2 + [95%CI ]2 +………. [95%CI ]2 )

Where [95%CI ] = 95% confidence interval for component 1 (e.g. aboveground biomass),
c1
component 2, etc. for all components measured in the plots)
The change in carbon stock is calculated by subtracting the mean carbon stock at time 2 from
that at time 1. The confidence interval is calculated as:
Total 95% CI = √( [95%CI ]2 + [95%CI ]2 )
time1 time2
Where [95%CI ] = 95% confidence interval for time 1 and [95%CI ] = 95% confidence
time1 time2
interval for time 2.
The net change is calculated as above for permanent plots by subtracting the initial carbon stocks
(practically zero if afforestation occurs on former cropland). Finally, the total carbon stock
change on a per unit area basis is multiplied by the total area to produce an estimated total
change in carbon and confidence interval for the area.
