3. Models should be scientifically reviewed. A thorough peer review process would
include evaluation of equations, modeling system, software, and calibration data set,
for applicability and adequacy. In addition the review should be conducted not only
by modeling specialists, but specialists in relevant fields of biology, ecology,
physiology, etc.
4. When possible, model results should be compared with field observations and results
of this comparison should be documented.
5. Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to examine model behavior across the range
of parameters for which it is to be applied. Sensitivity analysis provides an
understanding of model robustness, and helps increase a user’s confidence in model
results.
6. Model should be made available for testing/evaluation.
7. Because models are a function of the scientific understanding and data at the point in
time at which the model was developed, they should be periodically reviewed in light
of new knowledge and data. If necessary, models should be recalibrated based on
this evaluation.
8. When models are applied for regulatory purposes or in policy development, a public
comment period is critical.
Peer review is an important part of the model evaluation process. Although models used in the
private sector may be confidential, the internal evaluation process should also follow standards
for peer review. Recommendations for conducting scientific peer review from the Office of
Management and Budget (as cited in Prisley and Mortimer, 2004) include:
• peer reviewers be selected primarily on the basis of necessary technical expertise,
• peer reviewers be expected to disclose to agencies prior technical/policy positions
they may have taken on the issues at hand,
• peer reviewers be expected to disclose to agencies their sources of personal and
institutional funding (private or public sector), and
• peer reviews be conducted in an open and rigorous manner.
2.4 Validating models with field data
The data used to test the model results should be independent of the data used to parameterize
the model. There are many kinds of statistical tests available for quantifying the conformance of
