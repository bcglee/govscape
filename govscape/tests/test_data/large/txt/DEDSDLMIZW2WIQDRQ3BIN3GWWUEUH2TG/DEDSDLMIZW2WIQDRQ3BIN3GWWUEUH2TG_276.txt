completed. If there are any problems with the monitoring plot data (that cannot be resolved), the
plot should not be used in the analysis. Errors can be reduced if the entered data are reviewed
using expert judgment and, if necessary, comparison with independent data.
3.6.4 QA/QC for data archiving
Because of the relatively long-term nature of forestry activities, data archiving (maintenance and
storage) will be an important component of the work. Data archiving should take several forms:
• Original copies of the field measurement (either data sheets or electronic files) and laboratory
data should be maintained in original form and placed on electronic media, and stored in a
secure location, by the carbon measurement implementers.
• Copies of all data analyses and models; the final estimate of the amount of carbon
sequestered; any GIS products; and a copy of the measuring and monitoring reports should
all be stored in a dedicated and safe place, preferably offsite.
It is recommended that given the time frame for reporting and the pace of production of updated
versions of software and new hardware for storing data, that the electronic copies of the data and
report be updated periodically or converted to a format that could be accessed by any future
software application.
