3.4.2.2 Dead wood
Dead wood, both standing and lying, does not generally correlate well with any index of stand
structure (Harmon et al., 1993). Methods have been developed for measuring biomass of dead
wood and have been tested in many forest types and generally require no more effort than
measuring live trees (Harmon and Sexton, 1996; Delaney et al., 1998). There are two
approaches that can be used to estimate the volume of dead wood lying on the ground, depending
upon the expected quantity present.
Method 1 –when the quantity is expected to be less than about 10-15% of the aboveground
biomass: A time-efficient method is the line-intersect method. Experience has determined that at
least 100 m length of line per plot must be used (Harmon and Sexton 1996). For practical field
purposes experience has shown that placing two 50 m sections of line at right angles across the
plot center is a time efficient approach. However, the line could just as readily be established as
one 100 m length through the plot center. To allow remeasurement of the same ‘dead wood plot’
it is important to accurately record where the line was placed. Each piece of dead wood is
classified into one of several density classes. The diameters of all pieces of wood that intersect
the line are measured, their density class noted, and the volume per unit area calculated for each
density class as follows:
Volume of lying dead wood
Volume (m3/ha) =π2 * [(d12 + d22…….dn2)/8L]
Where d1, d2, dn = diameter, in cm, of each of the n pieces intersecting the line, and L = the length of the line (100
m recommended) (for more details see Harmon and Sexton, 1996).
Method 2 –when the quantity is expected to be more than 10-15% of the aboveground biomass:
When the quantity of dead wood lying on the forest floor is expected to be high and variably
distributed, it is more desirable to do a complete inventory of the wood in the permanent plots.
In this method all the dead wood in one of the medium circles of the sample plots should be
measured (see also Harmon and Sexton 1996 for details on the methods). For a complete census,
the volume of each piece of dead wood lying within the circle is calculated based on the diameter
measurements taken at 1 m intervals along each piece of dead wood in the plot. The volume of
each piece is then estimated as the volume of a truncated cylinder based on the average of the
two diameter measurements and the distance between them (usually 1 m). As with method 1,
each piece of dead wood is also classified into a density class. The volume is summed for each
density class and using the appropriate factor (based on the area of the plot) expressed on a m3/ha
basis for each density class.
Density measurements: Experience shows that three density classes are sufficient—sound,
intermediate and rotten. An objective and consistent way to distinguish between them is needed.
A common practice in the field is to strike the wood with a strong sharp blade--if the blade
bounces off it is sound, if it enters slightly it is intermediate, and if it causes the wood to fall
apart it is rotten. Samples of dead wood in each density class are then collected to determine
their wood density. Mass of dead wood is then the product of volume per density class (from
above equation) and the wood density for that class. Thus a key step in this method is
