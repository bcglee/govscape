disposition of carbon in harvested wood products (see Example 1.4). The stand-level volume of
growing stock in live trees, such as 172.1 m3/ha in Table 1.3, is used to predict total carbon in
harvested wood. Growing-stock volume from the ecosystem table is converted to categories of
roundwood carbon mass according to factors in Tables 1.4 and 1.5. The disposition of this
carbon in wood products is then allocated according to Table 1.6. Additional information on the
use or adaptation of the harvest scenario tables can be found in the methods section that follows,
Example 1.4, and Appendix D.
1.3.2 Product-based Estimates
Harvest information is often available in the form of wood delivered to mills or the output of
mills. As such, the product-based estimates of carbon in harvested wood products focus on
quantities of wood as the starting point for calculating the disposition of carbon. Specifically,
these starting points are industrial roundwood logs or primary wood products (such as lumber,
panels, or paper) as indicated in Figure 1.3. Thus, quantities are of total carbon and not directly
linked to forest area. The disposition of carbon in products based on an initial quantity, or
carbon mass, of roundwood is allocated according to Table 1.6. The specific carbon content of
primary wood products is calculated from factors in Table 1.7. The disposition of carbon over
time for these primary products is according to factors in Tables 1.8 and 1.9, which provide the
fractions of carbon from original primary products that remain in use or in landfills, respectively.
Again, additional information on the use or adaptation of the tables for product-based
calculations can be found in the section that follows, Examples 1.5 and 1.6, and Appendix D.
1.4 Methods and Data Sources for Tables
The purpose of this section is to provide detailed information on data sources, models, and
assumptions used in developing the tables or calculations described earlier. Also, we outline
linkages between the carbon calculations. These further illustrate how the tables were developed
and updated, how the methods were applied, and provide information needed to further modify
or customize the tabular carbon summaries.
In these tables, we provide estimates for as many as ten carbon pools. Forest structure provides a
convenient modeling framework for assigning carbon to one of six distinct forest ecosystem
pools: live trees, standing dead trees, understory vegetation, down dead wood, forest floor, and
soil organic carbon (Table 1.1). These pools are consistent with guidelines of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Penman and others 2003). The disposition of
carbon in harvested wood is summarized in four categories that describe the end-fate of the
harvested wood: products in use, landfills, emitted with energy capture, and emitted without
energy capture (see definitions in Table 1.1).
1.4.1 Forest Ecosystem Carbon
Forest ecosystem carbon is significantly affected by the following factors: region of the United
States, forest type, previous land use, management, and productivity. The development and
