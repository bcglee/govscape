For the calculation of increment the exact usage of these equations is important. For tagged trees
in permanent plots, it is not possible to simply calculate the total aboveground biomass at time 1
and time 2, apply the equations and then divide by the number of years. This approach cannot
account for ingrowth or mortality trees (see section 3.4.1). Instead change in belowground
biomass stocks should be calculated using the following method:
1. Calculate aboveground biomass at time 1 using allometric equations and the appropriate
expansion factors.
2. Calculate increment of biomass accumulation aboveground between time 1 and time 2
(see section 3.4.1), and add to time one to estimate the biomass stock at time 2.
3. Apply appropriate belowground equation (above) to estimate belowground biomass at
each time interval.
4. (Time 2 belowground â€“ time 1 belowground) / number of years = annual change in stock
of biomass belowground.

3.4.3.1 Forest floor
The forest floor can be directly sampled by simple harvesting techniques in small subplots within
each permanent plot (Figure 3.4). A small frame (either circular or square), usually
encompassing an area of about 0.25 m2 (if the forest floor is particularly deep as often found in
some of the western US forests, then a smaller frame [0.06 m2] can be used), as described for
herbaceous vegetation above, is generally used. If herbaceous material is collected, the forest
floor can be collected from the same frames at the same locations. Using a pair of clippers, all
live vegetation from the sample area is carefully removed. Living mosses should be clipped at
the base of the green, photosynthetic material. Using a sharp knife or a pair of clippers, the forest
floor along the inner surface of the frame is carefully cut through to separate it from the
surrounding soil. The entire volume of the forest floor must be carefully removed from within
the confines of the sampling frame down to the top of the mineral soil layer (to distinguish the
bottom of the forest floor from the top of the mineral soil see section below on soil organic
carbon). All litter within the frame is collected, all samples pooled and weighed. A well-mixed
sub-sample is collected and placed in a marked bag. This sample is used to determine oven dry-
to-wet weight ratios to convert the total wet mass to oven-dry mass. For practical purposes when
a laboratory is not available, forest floor samples can be sent to professional labs for drying and
weighing.
For the forest floor, amounts of C per unit area are given by:
(forest floor oven dry weight (g) / sampling frame area (cm2)) x 100
where multiplying by 100 converts the units to metric t/ha.
