aRatios are calculated from carbon mass based on biomass component equations in Jenkins and
others (2003) applied to all live trees identified as growing stock on timberland stands classified
as medium- or large-diameter stands in the survey data for the conterminous United States from
USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis Program’s database of forest surveys
(FIADB; USDA For. Serv. 2005, Alerich and others 2005). Note that “sawtimber trees” and
“poletimber trees” are not stand-level classifications as used here; these terms apply to
individual trees. Carbon mass is calculated for boles from stump to 4-inch top, outside
diameter.
bNorth Central includes the Northern Prairie States and the Northern Lake States; Pacific Coast
includes the Pacific Northwest (West and East) and the Pacific Southwest; Rocky Mountain
includes Rocky Mountain, North and South; and South includes the Southeast and South
Central.
cSoftwood sawtimber-size are trees at least 22.9 cm (9 in) d.b.h., and softwood poletimber-size
trees are 12.7 to 22.6 cm (5.0 to 8.9 in) d.b.h.
dHardwood sawtimber-size is at least 27.9 cm (11 in) d.b.h., and hardwood poletimber-size trees
are 12.7 to 27.7 cm (5.0 to 10.9 in) d.b.h.
eWhen applying these ratios to roundwood, we assume that ratios based on sawtimber-size trees
and ratios based on poletimber-size trees in the forest apply to saw log roundwood and pulpwood
roundwood, respectively.
