aApplicable to roundwood without bark or fuelwood, which is classified as:
SW/HW=Softwood/Hardwood, SL/PW=Saw log/Pulpwood.
bEstimates are calculated according to: fraction =a×exp(-((year/b)c)), based
on proportions in Table 1.7 of Birdsey (1996). We assume that values in the
Birdsey (1996) table are that portion of the growing-stock volume harvested
and removed from the forest, so that the values are generally accurate when
applied to roundwood categories.
cWest includes hardwoods in Pacific Northwest, East; Pacific Southwest;
Rocky Mountain, North; and Rocky Mountain, South.
