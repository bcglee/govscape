manufacture or processing. Roundwood is classified by region (Fig. 1.1) and category: softwood
saw logs, softwood pulpwood, hardwood saw logs, and hardwood pulpwood. Saw logs come
from larger diameter trees and generally are utilized for solid wood products; pulpwood comes
from smaller diameter trees and usually is used for pulpwood products. Some roundwood
classifications are pooled across regions for Table 1.6; this is done where production of a
particular type is relatively low. Roundwood, as classified for Table 1.6, excludes bark on logs
and wood used as fuelwood. The allocation of emitted carbon to the fraction associated with
energy capture is based on the allocation patterns in Birdsey (1996). A numerical application of
Table 1.6 is provided in Example 1.5. See Appendix D for additional background information
and sample calculations used to generate Table 1.6.
Scenarios for Forest Ecosystem Harvest. The land-based starting point for calculating the
disposition of carbon in harvested wood products is from the forest ecosystem carbon tables (for
example, Table 1.3), as described in Figure 1.3 (trees in forests). Calculations starting with
wood in forests are distinctly different from starting with products in two respects: 1) inputs are
land-based measures of merchantable wood in a forest, such as growing-stock volume, and 2)
estimates of carbon in harvested wood also include fuelwood as well as bark on all logs
(roundwood and fuelwood). The bases for linking forest ecosystems to roundwood, and thus the
disposition of carbon in products, are compilations of summary values from harvest statistics
(Johnson 2001) and estimates of tree biomass (Jenkins and others 2004) applied to current
FIADB survey data.
Converting growing-stock volume to carbon mass in roundwood is based on factors in Tables 1.4
and 1.5. Table 1.4 is used to partition growing-stock volume according to species type
(softwood or hardwood) and size of logs. This is followed by converting volume to carbon mass
according to the carbon content of wood. These values for carbon in growing-stock volume are
extended to estimates of carbon in roundwood according to factors in Table 1.5. The disposition
of carbon is then based on Table 1.6.
The harvest scenario tables were constructed from the ecosystem tables by appending a
reforestation table (from Appendix B) to an afforestation table (from Appendix A) at a stand age
designated as a clearcut harvest. Carbon in harvested wood products was added by applying
factors in Tables 1.4 through 1.6. The Appendix C tables are examples of how forest carbon
stocks can include carbon in harvested wood; these are not recommendations for rotation length
or timing of harvest. Assumptions and background data for compiling Tables 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6
(as well as the other starting points for calculating carbon in harvested wood products) are
included in Appendix D. Despite differences in input data and extent of harvested carbon
included, all three starting points rely on the same model of allocation and longevity of end uses.
They differ only in the level of detail available as the principal source of information on
harvested wood (Fig. 1.3).
