Example 1.1 – Obtain values for carbon stock and net stock change for stands of maple-
beech-birch in the Northeast.
Use Table 1.2 to determine values for live tree carbon stock at years 25 and 45 and calculate net
stock change over the interval.
Reading directly from the table, live tree carbon stocks are 53.2 and 87.8 t/ha for years 25 and
45, respectively.
Net annual stock change in live tree carbon between year 25 and 45, which is from the difference
in stocks divided by the length of the interval between stocks:
Net annual stock change = (87.8 – 53.2) / 20 = 1.7 t/ha/yr
The positive value for stock change indicates a net increase in carbon over the interval; this is
consistent with the sign convention used for net stock change in this document. This tabular
approach is applicable to all carbon pools in Appendices A, B, and C. Users must first classify
the forest of interest and choose the most appropriate table.
