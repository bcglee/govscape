Chapter 1, GHG Inventories: Part I
Appendix Section 3: Measurement Protocols for Forest
Carbon Sequestration
3.1 Scope of Guidelines
The scope of this section is to provide guidance on protocols for measuring and monitoring
carbon emissions or removals from forestry activities at both the entity and sub-entity scales. An
entity could be involved in more than one sector, such as a utility company that has both forestry
and power production activities. In the context of these guidelines, only the forestry sector part
of the entity’s greenhouse gas inventory is considered. The section supports the Voluntary
Reporting of Greenhouse Gas program of the U.S. government, also known as 1605(b).
Although large entities are required to report their entire inventory of emissions and
sequestration in order for the report to be registered, the estimation of the forestry portion of their
comprehensive inventory requires specialized inventory methods as described in the forestry
technical guidelines. Small entities can register reductions from specific activities without
supplying a complete greenhouse gas inventory if certain criteria are met. Entities may use one
or a combination of estimation methods: look-up tables, models, or measurement (see section 2.6
in Technical Guidelines for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Chapter 1, Section I).
The goal of this section of the guidelines is to provide more detailed guidance for: defining
boundaries; measuring, monitoring, and estimating changes in carbon stocks; implementing
plans to measure and monitor carbon; and developing quality assurance and quality control
plans.
Forestry activities mainly affect the exchange of carbon dioxide between the land and
atmosphere. Techniques and methods for measuring and monitoring (M&M) terrestrial carbon
pools that are based on commonly accepted principles of forest inventory, soil sampling, and
ecological surveys are well established and will be elaborated on further in the following
sections.
Most forestry activities designed to increase carbon stocks have few non-CO greenhouse gas
2
emissions associated with them. Exceptions include: use of fertilizer to enhance tree growth
(possible N O emissions), forested wetland restoration (possible increase in CH emissions), use
2 4
of nitrogen-fixing trees (possible increase in N O emissions), and biomass burning for instance
2
in site preparation (possible increase in N O and CH emissions). It is likely that these are for
2 4
the most part insignificant in the forest sector and practical and cost-efficient methods for
measuring these non-CO greenhouse gases in this sector are less well developed.

For forestry activities, it is not always necessary to measure all pools (Brown et al., 2000)—
selective or partial accounting systems may be appropriate as long as all pools for which
emissions are likely to increase as a result of the activity (loss in carbon or emission) are
included. The selection of which pools to measure and monitor depends on several factors,
including expected rate of change, magnitude and direction of the change, availability and
accuracy of methods to quantify change, and cost to measure. All pools that are expected to
