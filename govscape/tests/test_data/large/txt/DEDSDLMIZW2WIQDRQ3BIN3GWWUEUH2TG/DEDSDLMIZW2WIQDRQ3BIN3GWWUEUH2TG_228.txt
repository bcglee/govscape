2.3 Model evaluation and documentation
Model evaluation and documentation are important steps in developing an inventory of forest
carbon. The accuracy of carbon stock and flux estimates is in part a function of model
performance in relation to conditions of the entity. Therefore, the following guidelines are
provided for evaluating and documenting models chosen by the entity to estimate carbon stocks
and flows.
These guidelines are based on an extensive review of how ecological or forestry-related models
are evaluated for public policy (Prisley and Mortimer, 2004). There are published standards for
model evaluation for some applications. For example, the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) has guides for groundwater flow models and standards for atmospheric
dispersion model performance (ASTM, 2000; 2002).
No standards have yet been established specifically for forest carbon accounting; however, there
is general guidance available for Federal agencies providing information. The Data Quality Act
(Pub. L. No. 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763A-153 [2000]) requires that nearly all Federal agencies
provide guidance to maximize integrity of information disseminated by the agency, and provides
a mechanism to request a correction from the agency. As a result of the Data Quality Act, the
Department of Agriculture (USDA, 2003; as cited in Prisley and Mortimer, 2004) released
guidance that includes the following:
When creating estimates or forecasts that are derived from existing data sources using
models or other techniques [emphasis added]:
• Use sound statistical methods that conform to accepted professional standards.
• Document models and other estimation or forecasting techniques to describe the data
sources used and the methodologies and assumptions employed.
Prisley and Mortimer (2004) summarize criteria to be considered in determining appropriate use
of a model, including listing model assumptions, limitations, and uncertainties; use of peer-
review; and adequate empirical testing. Entities using models should follow these guidelines to
receive a higher rating (see section 2.5):
1. The scope of the model should be clearly defined. This is the model domain, and can
be expressed in terms of ecophysiographic regions, spatial scale, temporal scale, etc.
The model application should then be limited to the domain for which a model has
been developed and evaluated.
2. Models should be clearly documented. Documentation should include assumptions,
known limitations, embedded hypotheses, assessment of uncertainties, and sources
(for equations, data sets, factors or parameters, etc).
