Mr. Chairman I will outline the record of ESG involvement in various
Agent Orange studies.
First I must state the obvious in order to avoid the hope of easy
answers. Unfortunately, but not unpredictably, combat operations were not
designed as an epidemiological laboratory. Combat does not contribute to
anyone's health, nor does it favor scientific review that is based on the
correlation of statistics. Yet, the records generated during military
conflicts can serve many uses. I will briefly describe our efforts in
reviewing the records from Vietnam.
Our first study involved Birth Defects. In December of 1983 ESG pro-
vided the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) exposure opportunity scores on
536 Vietnam veterans. This required ESG to develop a procedure to identify
a unit's area of operation for each participant in the study. In addition,
ESG established a board of military experts to evaluate each case.
Another phase of ESG operations involved assistance to veterans and the
Department of Justice. Hundreds of documents were provided in connection
with the civil class action lawsuit involving the Vietnam veterans, chemical
companies and the U.S. Government. The claim against the U.S. Government
was later dismissed, except for wives and dependents claims. This was a
major undertaking, as our job involved records support for all parties. It
meant examining and cataloging the 40,000 linear feet of combat unit records
from the Vietnam conflict.
ESG provided additional exposure opportunity scores on Vietnam veterans
for the Veteran Administration's Chloracne and Adipose Tissue Studies.
We are currently doing military research on eight other VA studies
concerning Agent Orange.
As to the current interaction with the CDC, CDC was provided personnel
data for over 20,000 study subjects for what is termed the Vietnam
