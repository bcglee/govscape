CDC has suggested a method for verifying whether exposure to dioxin actually
occurred in a cohort of Vietnam veterans classified as potentially exposed to
Agent Orange by military records. This verification would compare the actual
level of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) found in veterans' fat or
blood with the military record exposure estimate. Using these fat samples in
conjunction with military records had been considered and<*.:ih--cted in 1983
during the development of the original protocol because of these factors:
o At that time it was believed that the half life of residual dioxin in
previous exposed persons was too short (about 1 year) to be of use in
a study done 15 or 20 years after exposure.
o The estimation of body burdens would require the use of fatty tissue
for analysis. Twenty grams of fat, or a specimen about the size of a
man's thumb, were required. It was not felt feasible to use this
procedure in a large number of veterans because a surgical procedure
was required.
Recent evidence indicates a much longer half life of dioxin in man. It is now
known to be more than 5 years, so a study done 15 years after exposure (2-3
half lives) would still be able to detect residual dioxin in those who had
been highly exposed. In addition, recent advances in technology indicate that
it may now be possible to measure TCDD levels in blood rather than fat. CDC
has been independently evaluating a method for measuring TCDD levels in
blood. This evaluation will correlate TCDD levels in fatty tissue and in
