language, procedures and scientific techniques.
Due to lack of agreement on assumptions, government scientists never
approved an exposure model crucial to the study.
On September 12, 1985, ESG completed the only record of documented
military spraying by helicopter, backpack, ground spraying, aborts and
leaks. This document, now known as the "Services Herbs Tape," provided a
second source, other than the Air Force Operation Ranch Hand, for the
matching of units to Agent Orange spraying.
Defoliation spraying may have occurred at main base camps, fire support
bases and landing zones. Unfortunately, the records are not complete enough
to substantiate the magnitude of these operations. Whether or not these
bases were sprayed by Orange, Blue, White or diesel fuel is not known to us
since complete documents are not contained in the units' records. In the
9th Infantry Division's area alone there were about 365 such locations that
might or might not have been sprayed. Yet, the records only show a total of
4?8 perimeter sprays for all of Vietnam during the entire war, although
there were 11 plus U.S. Divisions, 2 Korean Divisions, 1 Thai and 1
Australian Division in Vietnam. -
The Chairman of the Science Panel, Agent Orange Working Group then
tasked ESG to conduct a decisive Pilot Study on unit/troop exposure.
Accordingly, ESG researched and completed grid coordinate locations for
all companies of seven combat battalions covering the period 1 October 1966
to 31 March 1969. ESG then matched the grid coordinate locations of each
company by date against the Ranch Hand and "Services Herbs Tape" to produce
an exposure opportunity score for each company. ESG then provided unit
exposure opportunity scores on 700 individuals from these units using
varying time and distance criteria.
