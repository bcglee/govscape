In May of 1983, CDC completed and submitted a draft research protocol for
scientific review and comment by four groups: the Office of Technology
Assessment (OTA), the Science Panel of the Agent Orange Working Group (AOWG),
the HHS Advisory Committee on Special Studies Relating to the Possible Long
Term Effects of Phenoxy Herbicides and Contaminants (the "Ranch Hand Panel"),
and COC's own independent Ad Hoc Review Panel.
The format for these studies was published in November 1983. It incorporated
modifications suggested by the scientific reviewers and included three
independent but related studies that together comprise the Agent Orange
Projects. These studies are:
1) The Vietnam Experience: a study of the long-term health effects
of military service in Vietnam, including reproductive effects.
2) The Agent Orange: a study of the long-term health effects of
exposure to herbicides in Vietnam.
3) The Selected Cancers: a study to determine the risks
of specific cancers among Vietnam veterans.
These three studies represent a comprehensive approach to evaluating the
health of Vietnam veterans.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) gave preliminary approval for
conduct of the studies in May 1984. By August CDC awarded the first of what
would eventually be 15 major contracts for data collection. The first health
interviews of Vietnam veterans â€”a test of systems to identify, locate, and
collect data for the Vietnam Experience Study- were begun in September 1984.
