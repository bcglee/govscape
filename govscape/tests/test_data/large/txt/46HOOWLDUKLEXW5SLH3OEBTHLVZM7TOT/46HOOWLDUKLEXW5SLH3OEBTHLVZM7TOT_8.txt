testify today to tell us what policy decisions are to be made based on
the science panel's recommendations. If the protocol for the study is
unworkable, then how does this Administration propose to fulfill the
mandate of the Congress and complete the study. But, Mr. Newman declined
to testify.
No one expected the study to be easy. We did expect, however, that
the major players would keep us informed of its problems and its
progress. The Congress authorized this study in 1979- It's now 1986.
It appears that we are no further along after all this time and all these
dollars spent in getting this study underway than we were eight years
ago.
The Vietnam veterans of this country deserve better efficiency on
the part of their government than that. They deserve a better show of
good faith than this.
1 remember, in 1982 sitting in this hearing room in similar
circumstances. It wasn't the Department of Health and Human Services, or
the Centers for Disease Control who had dropped the ball on the study.
It was the Veterans Administration that had the initial "shot at it".
There was a question about who was dragging their feet on the Agent
Orange question then.
The response ironically came from one of our witnesses today. On
September 12, 1982 Dr. Vernon Houk of the Centers for Disease Control
responded this way:
"If I were responsible for the development of the protocol, I would get a
group of people, epidemiologists, laboratory people, the necessary ones
from our own shop, and outside help if we had to have it....put them in a
room and tell them not to come out until they had one done....that would
take,in my estimation, maybe- a--couple of weeks."
That was four years ago.
After four years there are still a lot of people locked up in a
room somewhere downtown with nothing to show for it. . Hopefully, in this
hearing we will open up that door.
