Statement of the Hon. Bob Edgar
Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Subcommittee on Hospitals and Health Care
July 31, 1986
Hearings on Agent Orange Studies
Thirteen times since 1978 the House Veterans Affairs Committee and
its Subcommittees have held hearings on the subject of Agent Orange.
Here we are again.
Being one of the original members of this committee to call for
those first hearings in the late 1970's I have to admit that this
nine-year process has been one of the most frustrating experiences in my
tenure on this committee.
Every time we think we have made a step forward in resolving the
Agent Orange question something always happens to push us two or four
steps backward.
Sometimes science and scientists have been the stumbling blocks.
Sometimes policy and policymakers have been the problem. And sometimes
the two get so mixed up that it is impossible for us to tell whether
Agent Orange is really an unsaleable problem or a problem nobody
really wants to solve.
Over the past few months we have been hearing consistent reports
that the major Agent Orange Study mandated by this committee and the
Congress in 1979 was in serious trouble. We heard that a recommendation
from a White House Science panel had been forwarded to the Agent Orange
Working Group declaring the protocol for the study scientifically
unfeasible.
Then we heard nothing...and heard nothing...and heard nothing.
So we called for these hearings to get a straight answer from the
Administration for the sake of all those Vietnam veterans who expect and
deserve that answer.
We asked to hear from Dr. Alvin Young, Past Chair of the White House
science subpanel that made the recommendation to the working group. Dr.
Young, who has testified many times before this committee, declined to
testify.
We asked to see a copy of Dr. Young's report. And we were told that
the White House or OMB would not let us have a copy of that report.
We invited Don Newman, Under Secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services and Chairman of the Agent Orange Working Group, to
