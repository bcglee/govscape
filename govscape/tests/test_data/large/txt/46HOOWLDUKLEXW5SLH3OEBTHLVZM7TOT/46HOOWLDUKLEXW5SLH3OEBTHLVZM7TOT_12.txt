assessments." In February 1984, OTA approved the general structure of CDC's
revised protocols, while noting that the details of a method for classifying
men according to Agent Orange exposure had yet to be worked out. As CDC
stated in their document, final decisions about the feasibility of the study
would have to await results of pilot studies of the methods and consideration
of their results. OTA agreed that this was an appropriate way to proceed.
The general approach outlined by CDC was to select 50 battalions from a
heavily sprayed area during a time of heavy Agent Orange use, and rank each
company (about 250 companies in total) according to a cumulative Agent Orange
exposure "score" based on some combination of time and distance measures. The
area chosen was the area designated "III Corps" during the period 1967 through
1968. The one-third of companies with the greatest opportunities for exposure
would supply the exposed group, and the one-third with the fewest
opportunities would supply the unexposed group. OTA believed at the time that
CDC needed to set the requirements for the necessary records research and
pilot tests so they could be implemented by the U.S Army and Joint Services
Environmental Support Group.
CDC transmitted its first report about exposure assessment to OTA in
February 1985, two years after CDC took control of the study. At that time,
data from battalion daily journals, the main source of grid coordinates for
companies and battalions, were available for 21 battalions for the two-year
period. Because grid coordinates were not recorded each day for each company,
gaps existed. CDC described two types of information that could be used to
fill gaps: battalion and brigade-level records that might contain additional
grid coordinates, and geographic names or name codes that appeared in some
records in lieu of grid coordinates for unit locations. Many of the place
names could be located at specific grid coordinates by use of a gazeteer. ESG
