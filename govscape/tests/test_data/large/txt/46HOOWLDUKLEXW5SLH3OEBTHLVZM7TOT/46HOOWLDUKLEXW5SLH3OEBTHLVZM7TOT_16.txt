In sum, the recent reports from CDC outline an Agent
Orange Study of radically different design than the one
that was initially reviewed and approved by OTA. The
changes are of sufficient magnitude to require
interruption of any plans for initiating interviews or
examinations of study subjects.
CDC did finally have data on a company level and some on an individual
level, but for no companies had all the gaps been filled, so the information
was still incomplete. CDC did not comment on the unexpectedly low level of
exposures seen in the data, and evinced no skepticism about the viability of
the study. OTA did, however. The serious problems still existing led to
OTA's recommendation that "no major new phase of the study should be
undertaken before the new design and exposure assessment method are found
acceptable."
Dr. James Mason, Director of CDC, wrote to the committees on January 6,
1986, responding to OTA's assertions. About exposure assessment, the letter
states:
We have a model for assessing exposure/nonexposure for
persons selected...This is one of the most
comprehensive models for possible exposure to an
environmental contaminant thus far devised. What
remains to be done is to develop methods of record
reviews to locate as accurately as possible the
placement of these men on each day they were.in

The letter also stated that the design changes noted by OTA had been
presented to the AOWG Science Panel and that the Science Panel "supported the
design changes." It goes on to say, "We are currently preparing a more
extensive statement, as requested by OTA, which we believe will clarify and
substantiate the design change." The report was to be submitted to OTA "in
time for a March-April 1986 review." The letter clearly states CDC's intent
to proceed with the interviews as planned, continuing for at least three
