used these additional sources of information to fill gaps, where possible, for
nine of the 21 battalions whose records had been abstracted. According to the
data presented by CDC in their report, even with the additional data, there
were too many gaps for companies to be used as the unit for characterizing
Agent Orange exposure. As stated by CDC:
For these reasons battalions rather than companies or
batteries will be the units whose locations form the
basis for ranking individual men's likelihood of
exposure to Agent Orange.
The shift from considering exposure based on a company to exposure based on
battalion locations constituted a major change from the original protocol.
The second major change presented in the February 1985 report was that men
would not be selected into the study by units, but by individual rankings.
CDC reported that high transfer rates of men among battalions necessitated
this change.
The OTA advisory panel met in February 1985 to review these changes,
and OTA produced a report in April. The first change is of far greater
importance than the second. A company contains about 100 to 150 men, while a
battalion is five times as large, upwards of 500 men. Battalions are spread
out over much larger areas than are the individual companies that make up the
battalion. CDC presented data showing multiple reported locations for a
single battalion on a single day. The different locations represent the
positions of individual companies or other subunits of the battalion. Using
those locations, CDC calculated a "centroid," an "average" point which was
assigned, for the purposes of the study, as a uniform location of each man in
the battalion. According to the data supplied in CDC's report, a reported
location could be nearly 20 kilometers from the centroid, and in fact, there
might not be one person actually at the centroid (see Figure). .The degree of
