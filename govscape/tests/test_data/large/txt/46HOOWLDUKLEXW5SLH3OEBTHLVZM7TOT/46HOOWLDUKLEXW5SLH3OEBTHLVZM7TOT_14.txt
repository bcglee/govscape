An Example of Recorded Positions of a Battalion's Subunits and the
Calculated "Centroid" of those Locations.
The spray tracks represent hypothetical Ranch Hand missions.
Spray track 1, passing directly over the centroid would result
in the entire battalion being classified as "exposed," while
in fact the only known locations are 19 km away.
Spray track 2, directly over the troop location, but 19 km from
the centroid, would result in no one being classified as "exposed."
