that the difficulty would be in finding unexposed individuals. This exposure
assessment problem led CDC to consider treating exposure as a continuous
variable; however, this idea was rejected after review by the Agent Orange
Working Group (AOWG) Science Panel and OTA. OTA recommended that the
initiation of the Agent Orange Exposure study be delayed until a totally
revised study protocol was developed and approved. The problem, however, is
defining a reliable exposure index when data are not sufficiently detailed or
nonexistent. CDC has revised the protocol with the exception of those
portions relating to selecting the study cohorts.
Let me emphasize that the difficulties in assessing exposure are related to
the scope and the content of the military records, not the manner in which
these military records were abstracted by ESG. The records were designed for
military purposes not for the purpose of doing epidemiologic studies. All
available information from military records is being used and was abstracted
appropriately by ESG.
Beginning in January 1984 and continuing until just weeks ago, an intensive
effort to separate exposed from unexposed veterans has been underway by the
ESG, the Science Panel of the AOWG, and CDC; the conclusion of this effort is
that by using military records alone, it is not possible to distinguish
between exposed and unexposed cohorts. Records indicate that only a small
proportion of men in the seven pre-test battalions had a likelihood of
significant exposure to recorded Agent Orange sprays. A Subpanel of the Agent
Orange Science Panel was established specifically to look at these issues.
