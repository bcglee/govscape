Statement Record Version
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
I am Richard S. Christian, Director of the U.S. Army and Joint
Services Environmental Support Group (ESG), Department of the Army. I am
pleased to appear before the Committee to provide, in response to your
request, ESG's research missions in support of the Agent Orange
Epidemiological Study, mandated by Public Law 96-151.
The Army became actively involved in the Agent Orange issue early on
because we recognized its importance to operational readiness.
As the major Service involved in the subject, the Army is The Executive
Agent for all the Services on this issue.
Two point four (2.4) million Americans served in Vietnam from 1961 to
1973. These men and women served their country admirably. They deserve our
care.
The Army is keenly aware of its obligation and is dedicated to help
Vietnam veterans. The American Soldier, Sailor, Airman and Marine is
intelligent and wants frank answers to his concerns, and that is ESG's
purpose: to provide such answers.
In the last six years ESG has led in research, assistance, and pro-
viding information to Vietnam veterans.
Over 20,000 inquiries have been answered regarding veterans issues.
Eighty-Five percent(85/0 of these inquiries related to the issue of exposure
to Agent Orange.
