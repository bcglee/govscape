months, but stopping short of performing physical examinations, which would be
scheduled for late May or June 1986. To quote, "It is at that point that the
study can be aborted if available information is inadequate to distinguish
between nonexposed and exposed Vietnam veterans."
Both the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees responded to Dr.
Mason's letter with letters to HHS Secretary Bowen (January 10, 1986)
expressing their concerns about the study. Both letters stated that, by law,
no new major phase of the study could go forward until a protocol, including a
method of exposure assessment, was approved by OTA. The letter from the
Senate stated that interviews should not be conducted until such time as a
protocol was approved. While CDC based its decision to go ahead with
interviews on fiscal considerations, the Congress voiced its concern about
"the implications of interviewing subjects for the study only later to advise
them that the study is not going forward." Such an action could be
interpreted as an attempt to cover up early findings. To quote again, "Such a
result would be particularly unfortunate and undesirable." In response to the
Committees' letters, further interviewing was not carried out. We do not know
how many interviews actually took place.
At the same time that letters were sent to Secretary Bowen, the Senate
Committee wrote to the President, reminding him of his responsibility, as laid
out in PL 96-151, of assuring that "studies of the Federal Government with
respect to adverse health effects in humans of exposure to dioxins are
scientifically valid and conducted with efficiency and objectivity."
To date, OTA has not received a new protocol for the Agent Orange study
from CDC. The major activity that we are aware of is the undertaking of the
AOWG and ESG in assembling a set of complete location data for the study
period for 7 combat battalions, and examining the potential use of the data,
