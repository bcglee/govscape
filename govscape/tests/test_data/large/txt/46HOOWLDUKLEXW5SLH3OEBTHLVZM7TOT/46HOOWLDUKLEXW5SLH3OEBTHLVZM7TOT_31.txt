blood in individuals with little or no exposure and those with high levels of
exposure to TCDD. The evaluation of the blood/fat level relationship will be
completed and peer reviewed by September. If there is a correlation in this
relationship, it may be possible to conduct a validation study to determine
whether military records can be used to produce the two cohorts necessary for
a scientifically sound Agent Orange Exposure study. Again, if the correlation
is positive, CDC and ESG will develop a protocol for this validation, It is
expected that the protocol, its review and final action by AOWG and OTA, will
be completed by the end of this year,
If the validation study indicates that it is scientifically possible to
"separate exposed from unexposed veterans, then the method for identification
of the two cohorts will be included in the Agent Orange Exposure study
protocol to be evaluated by OTA and AOWG. An Agent Orange exposure study
cannot be done if the validation study demonstrates that it is not possible to
use military records to identify exposed from unexposed veterans.
The budget is the final area I will address. The total in-house costs for FY
1983-1986 for personnel, equipment, etc. are approximately $11.5 million which
have been allocated across the three studies. This figure is an estimate
since FY 1986 is not yet complete, The contractual costs/obligations are
broken down by the specific study. The vast majority of the contractual
obligations were made in FY 1984 when the funds were made available. For the
Selected Cancers Study, the total contractual obligations to date are
approximately $4.3 million; the Vietnam Experience study contractual
