their facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In participating a veteran agrees
to interrupt his life for several days of travel, tests, and examinations. As
of July 9, Lovelace had completed examinations of 4,048 veterans, and another
497 have been scheduled to be done between now and the end of September. Then
this phase of data collection for the Vietnam Experience study will be
completed.
The community of veterans has also been extremely cooperative during this more
personally demanding medical examination phase. The more than 4,500
examinations already completed or scheduled represent just over 70 percent
participation by veterans contacted by Lovelace. Considering the investment
in time and effort required by participating veterans, we think this is an
excellent response.
One goal of this phase of the data collection process has been to ensure that
the experience is as pleasant and "hassle free" as possible for the veterans.
The contractor has asked each participant to evaluate every step of the
examination process; from travel arrangements and hotel accommodations, to how
they feel that they have been treated by medical and support staffs. The
veterans' evaluations have been very positive: over 90 percent have rated the
overall experience as "excellent." A member of the CDC Agent Orange Project
staff is on permanent assignment in Albuquerque to work with the contractor.
Findings from the health interview and the medical examination will be
published simultaneously and are currently planned for May 1987.
