along with information about Agent Orange applications, to identify
individuals with high and low probabilities of Agent Orange exposure. OTA was
not directly involved in this activity, which was undertaken by a subpanel of
the AOWG Science Panel, under the chairmanship of Dr. Young, the
representative from the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The first
official OTA involvement came at the time of the Science Panel review of the
Subpanel report, in our role as observer. We have not received the report
officially, and our advisory panel has not met to discuss it. I believe,
also, that the report has not yet been made a public document. It is
therefore inappropriate for me to comment on the substance or recommendations
contained in that report.
OTA's most recent involvement came in the form of a June 26 letter from
HHS Under Secretary Donald Newman, chair of the AOWG. That letter requested
OTA's permission for CDC to prepare a protocol for a validation study to
explore a possible correlation between dioxin in blood with a records-based
definition of Agent Orange exposure. OTA Director Gibbons responded (July 11)
by stating that "OTA's statutory role is limited to approving protocols and
monitoring the conduct of studies" under the mandates of PL 96-151 and 97-72.
OTA does not have the authority to grant such approval. To my knowledge, CDC
has not been prohibited from preparing such protocols, only from embarking on
the studies themselves without protocol approval.
Thank you for the opportunity to report on OTA's mandated activities
related to exposure assessment for the Agent Orange study. I will be happy to
answer any questions you may have.
