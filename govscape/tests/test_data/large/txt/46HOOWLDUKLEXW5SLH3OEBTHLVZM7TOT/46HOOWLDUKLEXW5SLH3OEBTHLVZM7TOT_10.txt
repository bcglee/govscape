TESTIMONY OF HELLEN GELBAND
OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
U.S. CONGRESS
BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE
OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS
Review of OTA Activities Related to Exposure Assessment
for the Agent Orange Study
July 31, 1986
I am Hellen Gelband, Director of Special Projects and Agent Orange
Project Director in the Health Program of the Office of Technology Assessment.
OTA was given responsibility for reviewing and approving study protocols, and
monitoring the conduct of studies, under the mandates of Public Laws 96-151
and 97-72. I'd like to relate briefly OTA's involvement specifically related
to Agent Orange exposure assessment in one of the three studies planned by the
Centers for Disease Control in response to Congress's mandates. I will not
chronicle the history of the study before the time CDC gained responsibility
for it.
The Agent Orange study was proposed to examine the question of whether
ground troops exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam are more likely to be dying
at a faster rate or are in poorer health than are similar men who served in
Vietnam but were not exposed to Agent Orange. The study hinges on an ability
to assemble groups of men that are different with respect to exposure, but
similar in as many other ways as possible. This difference may be expressed
in several ways: high and low levels of "exposure opportunity," and high and
low "probabilities of exposure" are the types of terms applied. In the end,
however, whatever names are used, it is critical that there be a high degree
of certainty that the groups actually are different in their exposures to
Agent Orange. That does not mean that every man in the high exposure group
