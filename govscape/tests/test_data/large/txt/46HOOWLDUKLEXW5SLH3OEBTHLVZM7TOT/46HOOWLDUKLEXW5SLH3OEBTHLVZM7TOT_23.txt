Experience study participants were being completed, the first Agent Orange
exposure participants would have been identified. Thereby the interview and
examination phases of both studies would continue essentially without
interruption.
The delay in starting the Agent Orange exposure study has not had any direct
effect on the Vietnam Experience and the Selected Cancers studies, Both have
been proceeding on schedule.
STATUS OF THE SELECTED CANCERS STUDY
The Selected Cancers study will determine if Vietnam veterans are at increased
risk of developing certain cancers which have been identified in the
scientific literature as possibly associated with industrial or occupational
exposure to phenoxy herbicides and their dioxin contaminant. The cancers are:
lymphorna, soft tissue sarcoma, nasal and nasopharyngeal cancer, and primary
liver cancer. This case-control study was proposed because the sample size of
the two cohort studies is not large enough to provide answers about these
relatively rare cancers. The cases are those reported from December 1984
through November 1988 to eight tumor registries. The controls are selected
through a random digit dialing process. As cases and controls are identified,
it is not known whether they are military veterans and, if they are veterans,
whether they served in Vietnam.
