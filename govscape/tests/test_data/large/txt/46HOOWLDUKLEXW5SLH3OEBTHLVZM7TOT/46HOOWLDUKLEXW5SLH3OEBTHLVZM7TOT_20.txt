Public Laws 96-151 and 97-72 directed the Veterans Administration (VA) to
conduct investigations of Vietnam veterans' health. The first of these laws,
signed in January 1979, dealt with the health effects of veterans' exposure to
Agent Orange. The second, signed in November 1981, expanded the scope of the
study to allow for the inclusion of other environmental hazards associated
with service in Vietnam. CDC was assigned responsibility for design and
conduct of the studies in January 1983 by an Interagency Agreement with the VA.
