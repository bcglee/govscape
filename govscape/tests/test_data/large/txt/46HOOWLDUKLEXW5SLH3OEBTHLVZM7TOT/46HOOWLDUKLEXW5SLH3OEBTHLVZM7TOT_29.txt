The recommendation of the Subpanel was that "Any study of ground troops which
is dependent upon military records for the ascertainment of exposure to
herbicides, not be conducted without an additional method to verify
exposure." The basis for this recommendation was that the pilot study
confirmed a potential for considerable misclassification of an individual's
exposure to herbicides or dioxin as estimated from the military records
alone.
Two issues were specifically confirmed by the pilot study as influencing the
degree of misclassification.
o Unit dispersion - On a substantial number of days, personnel in
combat units eligible for the study were not located together as a
unit; rather they were dispersed geographically up to 20 kilometers
that same day.
o Incomplete spray records - Expert opinion suggested that an unknown
but apparently large proportion of fire-base perimeter spray
operations were never recorded and the degree to which these
unrecorded operations may have influenced exposure is unknown. The
record of aerial sprays, i.e., the Ranch Hand missions on the
so-called HERBS Tapes, are thought to be complete and without
question.
