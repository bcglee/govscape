misclassification that would be introduced by this approach appeared extremely
high.
To quote from OTA's April 1985 report:
These are serious problems. but OTA comes to no
conclusion about their impact on the study at this
time. We expect to hold another meeting in about six
months to hear from CDC about any improvements that can
be made. If there are no improvements, OTA may decide
that the problems of deciding on exposure are so
overwhelming that it is impossible to study the
possible effects of Agent Orange.
As a followup to our February panel meeting, OTA staff met with Mr.
Richard Christian and his colleagues of the ESG to discuss the problems CDC
had raised about the lack of information in the records for determining
locations for companies. It appeared that, in fact, ESG was able to locate
companies, if CDC would agree to using different types of information. OTA
staff urged that CDC and ESG hold a meeting to discuss that question, which
they did successfully, and ESG began to develop what has been called the
"contextual approach" to filling gaps in location data.
In late September 1985, Dr. Gibbons wrote to the Congressional
committees, expressing concern that no new information about CDC's exposure
assessment activities had come to OTA, but that CDC had not changed their
plans for interviews of study participants to begin in January. Discussions
between CDC and OTA resulted in CDC's agreeing to provide a revised plan for
exposure assessment before the scheduled interviews. OTA received relevant
documents between November 18 and December 13, and held an advisory panel
meeting on December 14 to review the material with the hope that the plan
would be far enough advanced to allow undertaking the interviews with
confidence that the study would proceed on a sound footing. Unfortunately,
what we found was to the contrary. Quoting from the letter sent by Dr.
Gibbons (December 19) to the committees as a result of that meeting:
