Experience Study. This study covers all those factors, including Agent
Orange that may have contributed to potential ill health of the military
personnel who served in Vietnam. Despite the requirements of abstracting 73
personnel data elements for each study subject, this task was completed
ahead of schedule. To supply this information 43,000 personnel files had to
be analyzed.
In 1983, the Science Panel and Office of Technology Assessment approved
ESG's portion of the Agent Orange Epidemiological Study protocol.
On 1 April 1984, we began the research for both the Vietnam Experience
Study and the major Agent Orange Study.
Changes were frequently made in battalion tracking for the Agent Orange
Epidemiological Study and personnel data abstraction, for both the Agent
Orange and the Vietnam Experience Study. This required frequent adjustment
of research to add, check, refine, assess and massage the data.
In July 1984, we were informed that eleven CDC contracts were signed,
resulting in new time tables for ESQ. We adjusted to meet the new deadli-
nes. Time tables and numbers of subjects and disqualification factors
repeatedly changed over the ensuing months.
In November 1984, a major change in workload required ESG to research
an additional 15 battalions, and revise the selection process for Agent
Orange study subjects. Concurrently for both the Agent Orange and the
Vietnam Experience Studies, CDC requested more documents for deceased
veterans.
In January 1985, CDC assigned new time frame deadlines and again
increased the amounts of personnel data required.
Differences in quality control between the military and the investiga-
tors occurred. Nonetheless, these issues were resolved after mutual
education of the scientists and military experts in military operations,
