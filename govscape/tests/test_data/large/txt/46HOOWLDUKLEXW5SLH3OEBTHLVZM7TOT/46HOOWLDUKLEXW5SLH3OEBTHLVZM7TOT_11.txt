was actually highly exposed, or that each man in the high exposure group was
exposed to more than any man in the low exposure group. It does mean,
however, that the groups should be clearly different and that we should be
able to characterize, at least roughly, what the difference is in logical
terms. Today, seven years after the Agent Orange study was mandated, after
much effort, there is still no clear answer about whether groups of ground
troops that differ in their exposure to Agent Orange can be identified.
From the outset, in the protocol outline produced in February 1983, CDC
recognized the difficulties of obtaining good information about Agent Orange
exposure. The feasibility of using military records that contained
information about troop movements together with other records that contain
Agent Orange spray locations had been shown in 1979 by the General Accounting
Office, and it is that strategy that has been the focus of CDC's attempts to
devise a scheme for exposure assessment. The intent was always to select
study participants on some records-based measure of proximity in time and
space to Agent Orange applications.
In June 1983, OTA reviewed protocols for the three studies planned by
CDC, one of which is the Agent Orange study. Because of the great
uncertainties concerning the records--particularly how complete they were and
how accurate they were considered to be--no final decisions could be made
about the study as a whole. As OTA stated in its review of that document, "it
is still possible that studying associations between health effects and Agent
Orange exposure may not be possible because the records will not provide
information for meaningful exposure classification." In their revised
protocol, which OTA received in January 1984, CDC stated: "Since many of the
proposed procedures are untested, modification, indeed even a recommendation
not to proceed with an Agent Orange study, may be required after pilot study
