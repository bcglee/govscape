The Pilot Study results revealed the dispersion of combat companies on
one-half the given days and that the units had little contact with Agent
Orange herbicide spray missions.
These were startling discoveries by even my own staff and the White
House Agent Orange Working Group Science Sub Panel, charged with evaluating
all available data. We had anticipated higher numbers of exposure than what
were actually recorded.
It should be clearly understood that ESG can identify a combat com-
pany's locations on a given day. However, records do not permit the loca-
tion of individual sub-elements or individual troops within these
sub-elements at each location. ESG is not qualified to answer the scien-
tific problems this creates. This is an issue the scientists must address.
ESG can only report what is contained in the records.
The Military Services performed all this work without outside funding.
Over the past six years we have expended 6 million dollars for these
efforts.
In summary: over the past three years the Military Services have been
scrutinized, scrubbed and critically examined by distinguished groups of
experts, such as the National Academy of Science, The Science Panel of the
White House Agent Orange Working Group and most recently the Science
Subpanel on Agent Orange assessment. The records do not support continuance
of the Agent Orange Epidemiological Study, that is, a study based solely
upon the use of military records to select cohorts on men potentially
exposed to Agent Orange. We are proud of our exhaustive work.
I shall be most pleased to answer any questions.
