of the stifle combustion products CCL, FLO and HC1, and none of the Herbicide
Orange constituents can theoretically exist in the incinerator environment
under equilibrium conditions.
In Table" D-4, existing experimental data on the incineration of Herbicide
Orange, 2,4-D ester, 2,4,5-T ester, as well as the theoretical analysis for the
incineration of Herbicide Orange onboard Vulcanus are presented^ * ''. The
test datajndicate that the destruction efficiency for either 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T
should be .greater than 99.99% with the Vulcanus incinerator, when the flame
temperature is above 1000°C and the oxygen level in the combustion product gas
is above 5%. The Marquardt test data also show that the TCDD destruction effi-
®
ciency was greater than 99.9% in the Sue burner, when the flame temperature
was in the 1450-1850°C range and the oxygen level in the combustion product gas
was above 4.7%. Utilizing theoretical models of droplet evaporation and com-
bustion gas mixing and extrapolating from the data base to the Vulcanus incin-
eration operation, Arthur D. Little has estimated that the TCDD destruction
efficiency with the Vulcanus incinerator will exceed 99% and is most likely to
be near 99.9%.
The Vulcanus is equipped with two identical furnaces, each with a combus-
o
tiorr air feed rate of 75,000 m /hr and a maximum liquid waste feed rate of
12 tonnes/hr. Since the air feed rate is normally maintained constant, the
