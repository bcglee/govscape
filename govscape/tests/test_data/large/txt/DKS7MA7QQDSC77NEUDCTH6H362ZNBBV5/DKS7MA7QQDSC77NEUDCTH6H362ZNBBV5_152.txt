may be anticipated. The 99.9 percent combustion efficiency corresponds to
approximately 100 ppm CO in the combustion product gas. The detection of large
amounts of CO in the stack gas (and hence lower combustion efficiency) is an
indication that incomplete combustion is taking place in the incinerator.
Incineration will be terminated if the combustion efficiency is less than
99.9 percent.
