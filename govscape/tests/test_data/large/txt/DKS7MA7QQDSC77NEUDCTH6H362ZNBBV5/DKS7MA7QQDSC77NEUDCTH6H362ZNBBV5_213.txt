6. LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHIC SEPARATIONS
Scope and ApplicatIon
Scope
This procedure is designed to give a separation of a sample into eight
.reasonably distinct classes of compounds.
Application
This procedure applies to Level 1 analyses and to those samples which con-
tain a minimum of 50 mg of nonvolatile organics.
Range
Samples may range from 50 to 100 mg. The optimum size is considered to
be 100 mg.
Sensitivity,
As defined, this procedure will permit the analyst to measure as low as
1 yg of residue.
Detection Limit
The detection limit is 1 yg of residue. â€¢
Interferences
There are no interferences.
Limitations. .
Compounds of too high polarity or molecular weight will not be eluted from
the column since this procedure is a compromise between cost and data acquisi-
tion. Also, compounds of too low molecular weight will be evaporated along
with the sample solvent during sample preparation.
Summary of Method
A sample of weighing from 50-100 mg is placed on a silica gel liquid
chromatographic column. A series of eight (8) eluents are employed to sepa-
rate the sample into eight nominally distinct classes of compounds for further
analyses.
