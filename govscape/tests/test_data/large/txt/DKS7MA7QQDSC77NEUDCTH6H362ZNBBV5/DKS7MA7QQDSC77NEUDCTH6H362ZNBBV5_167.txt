SWALLOWED POISONS
• CALL A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY
• DO NOT induce vomiting if;
1) Patient is in a coma or unconscious.
2) Patient is in convulsions
3) Patient has swallowed petroleum products (that is, kero-
sene, gasoline, lighter fluid).
4) Patient has swallowed a corrosive poison (strong acid or
alkaline products); symptoms: severe pain, burning sen-
sation in mouth and throat.
• If the patient can swallow after ingesting a corrosive poison,
give the following substances by mouth. A corrosive substance
is any material which in contact with living tissue will cause
destruction of tissue by chemical action such as lye, acids,
Lysol, etc.
For acids: milk, water, or milk of magnesia (1 tablespoon
to cup of water).
For alkali: milk or water; for patients 1-5 years old, 1 to
2 cups; for patients 5 years and older, up to 1 quart.
IF POSSIBLE INDUCE VOMITING WHEN NON-CORROSIVE
SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN SWALLOWED
• Give milk or water (for patient 1-5 years old - 1 to 2 cups;
for patients over 5 years — up to 1 quart).
• Induce vomiting by placing the blunt end of a spoon .not the
handle, or your finger at the back of the patient's throat,
or by use of this emetic - 2 tablespoons of salt in a glass
of warm water.
• When retching and vomiting begin, place patient face down
with head lowered, thus preventing vomitus from entering
lungs and causing further damage. Do not let him lie on
his back.
• Do not waste excessive time in inducing vomiting if the hos-
pital is a long distance away. It is better to spend the
time getting the patient to the hospital where drugs can be
administered to induce vomiting and/or stomach pumps are
available.
• Clean vomitus from person. Collect some in case physician
needs it for chemical tests.
