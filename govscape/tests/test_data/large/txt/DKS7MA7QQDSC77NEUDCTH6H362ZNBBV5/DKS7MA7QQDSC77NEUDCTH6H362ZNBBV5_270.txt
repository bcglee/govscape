and
K = 0/32 + Ci/28.362 - H/4.032
Now, the quantities K and K1 can be assumed to be second-order
variations related to the herbicide composition because of the
similarity in composition of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in the waste.
They are neglected. Variances in the C&/C ratio, used in the
% N2 calculation, Equation (14), are of more concern because
of the magnitude of the N2 content in the combustion effluent.
Variance in the Ci/C ratio must be considered if the herbicide
is diluted subsequent to the determination of a (the weight
fraction of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T in herbicide). This is especially
true if the diluent is quite different in composition from the
herbicide, such as the diesel fuel used to rinse drums and
other equipment involved in loading herbicide on the ship.
Equation (17) is the final expression for the destruction effi-
ciency of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T. A similar expression results for
the destruction efficiency of TCDD by substituting d for a and
e for b, where d and e are, respectively, the weight fraction
of TCDD in the herbicide and the emission rate of TCDD in the
combustion effluent.
*The variation in DE/100 can be approximated in the region of
the average values for the variables 0?, C02, C&/C, a, b, d,
and e by Taylor's expansion. Thus, for the variance in
