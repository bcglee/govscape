5.2 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PERSONNEL PROTECTION PLAN
The following goals were set for personnel protection onboard the M/T
Vulcanus:
• Isolating Herbicide Orange in working areas and excluding it
from living areas by defining boundaries between dirty and
clean areas
• Eliminating potential contamination carriers by providing for
decontamination at these boundaries
t Locating and controlling contamination in a timely manner
t Controlling and monitoring incinerator operations to prevent
workspace air concentrations of 2,4-0 and 2,4,5-T in excess
of TLVs.
Concepts developed in the Safety Plan were implemented by the test team
and the ship's officers and craw. Implementation of the personnel protection
procedures was effected by:
• A detailed briefing of ship and test personnel explaining the
need for following the procedures by all personnel and the
boundary-isolation concept
• Providing adequate and comfortable disposable protective cloth-
ing and a shower at the port exit from the combustion room
• Providing for an onboard analytical chemistry capability for
detecting the spread of contamination past set boundaries a.nd
workspace air concentrations in excess of TLVs.
Briefing of the crew of the M/T Vulcanus was carried out at Gulfport, MI,
just prior to loading the ship with Herbicide Orange. The briefing covered the
toxic properties of Herbicide Orange, the need for personal hygiene, and the
effectiveness of safety procedures in preventing exposure. Test personnel were
similarly briefed. All personnel who might have come into contact with Herbicide
Orange were given pre- and post-program physical examinations.
Protective clothing consisted of cellulose fiber coveralls and plastic
shoe covers. The coveralls were light, porous, comfortable and inexpensive.
They were discarded after each shift. Fresh coveralls were issued at the begin-
ning of each shift. Shoe covers were available at the exits from the living
quarters and at the port entrance to the combustion room. Disposal cans for
