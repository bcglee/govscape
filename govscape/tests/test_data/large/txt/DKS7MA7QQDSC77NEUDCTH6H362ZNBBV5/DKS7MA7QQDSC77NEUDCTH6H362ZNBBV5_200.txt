Summary of Method
The,,sample is placed or weighed into glass thimbles and extracted for
24 hours with high purity solvent, Pentane will be used to extract all sam-
ples. The resulting extracts are made to a standard volume and a small ali-
quot taken and set aside for GC analysis.
Sample Handling
All equipment (i.e., sample containers, spatulas, tweezers, etc.) that
contacts either the solid samples or the solvent extracts is to be glass,
Teflon, or stainless steel. No grease or lubricant of any kind is to be used
on the ground glass joints of the extraction apparatus.
All -glassware is to be rinsed with the same high purity solvent used for
the sample extraction (i.e., pentane).
Apparatus
• Soxhlet extractors in a range of sizes (Ace Glass sizes A to E)
with glass thimbles and condensers.
• Boiling flasks in a range of sizes from 125 ml to 500 ml with
stoppers.
• Volumetric flasks in a range of sizes from 100 to 500 ml.
• Heating mantles to fit boiling flasks and variable transformers,
or steam baths.
• Volumetric pipette, 2 ml, class A.
• Liquid scintillation vial with aluminum foil cap liner.
• Glass beads, 3 mm, plain,
• Filter paper, Whatman No. 1.
Reagents
Pentane, distilled-in-glass or Nanograde,
Procedure
1, Place the sample to be extracted in the glass thimble, cover
with pre-extracted glass wool. If the resin is wet with water,
allow to air dry in a clean, covered glass dish.
