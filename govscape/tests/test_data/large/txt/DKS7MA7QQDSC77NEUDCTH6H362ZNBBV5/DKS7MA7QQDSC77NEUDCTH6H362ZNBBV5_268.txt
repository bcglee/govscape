From Equation (5), the air feed rate is proportional to the
nitrogen content of the combustion effluent, so

• Substituting Equation (9) into Equation (6) gives
DE/100 = i -l . ,, (10)

where
K = 0/32 + CA/28.362 - H/4.032
• Excess air, Y in Equation (10), is defined as
0 - 0.5% CO

Y =

0.264% N - (% 0 - 0.5% CO)

Since CO in the combustion effluent is very small (ppm con-
centrations compared to percent concentrations for 0 and

0/(0.264% 0) (12)
The percentage of nitrogen can be inferred as the balance of
the product stream after 0 and C0 are measured and HC& is

calculated, i.e.,
% N - 100 - % 0 - % C0 - % HCt - % CO - % hydrocarbons
