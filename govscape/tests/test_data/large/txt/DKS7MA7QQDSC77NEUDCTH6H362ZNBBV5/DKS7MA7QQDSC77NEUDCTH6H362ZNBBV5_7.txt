Effluent sampling was accomplished using a traversing sample probe
installed on the starboard incinerator. A USAF benzene impinger train and a
modified EPA Method 5 train were used to acquire combustion effluent samples.
Analysis of these samples was conducted to determine destruction efficiencies
for the normal butyl esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5 tri-
chlorophenoxyacetic acid, primary constituents of Herbicide Orange, as well as
2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a contaminant present in the herbicide.
.Destruction efficiencies in excess of 99.9% were determined for all three
burns.
Destruction and combustion efficiencies measured during the Research and
Special Permit burns met or exceeded requirements. All other conditions of
the permits related to at-sea incineration operations were met including adher-
ence to a comprehensive safety plan.
