5. PERSONAL HYGIENE
The observed effects on animals of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or
of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic and n-butyl ester (2,4,5-T) containing TCDD are
described in detail in Reference 1. The effects observed on workers are sum-
marized below, to emphasize the need for personnel hygiene.
• Chloracne (moderate to severe skin irritation, with swelling,
hardening, blackheads, pustules and pimples)
• Hyperpigmentation (skin discoloration)
• Hirsutism
• Eye irritation
• Muscular pain (legs, arms, back, breast)
: • Decreased libido
• Fatigue
• Nervous irritability
• Intolerance to cold
• Destruction of nerve fibers and nerve sheaths
In addition, some effects on exposed test animals were observed. These
may be considered possible effects on the human system, especially when the
metabolism of the animal is similar to that of man. These effects include
toxicity to embryos, birth defects., possible carcinogenicity, and even death.
It should also be noted that the greatest hazard is to pregnant females and
their fetuses, especially in the first third of the pregnancy period.
