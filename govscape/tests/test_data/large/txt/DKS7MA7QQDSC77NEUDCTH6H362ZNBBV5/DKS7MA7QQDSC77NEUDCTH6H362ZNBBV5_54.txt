included a portion of the probe and heat-traced line rinses for that test. The
apportionment of the probe and heat-traced line rinses was based on the amount
of stack effluent acquired in a given sorbent trap or impinger sample. Thus, if
a Lear-Siegler sorbent trap sample represented 94% of the total volume of efflu-
ent sampled, then 94% each of the probe and heat-traced line rinses for that
test were taken as part of that Lear-Siegler train sample in order to obtain
proper mass discharge rates.
Table 6 gives the total volume of effluent sampled in each test, volumes
of each probe and heat-traced line rinse, volumes of effluent represented by
each sorbent trap and impinger sample, and portions of each probe and heat-
traced line rinse which are part of each sorbent trap and impinger sample.
3.6 SAMPLE NOMENCLATURE
The variety and number of samples acquired onboard the M/T Vulcanus neces-
sitated a compact nomenclature. Table 7 lists the sample labeling scheme used
on the ship and in the subsequent analyses. These sample designators are used
in presenting analytical results. A typical sample name might be HO-1-ST-714-F.
This designation means:
• t HO - Herbicide Orange program
t 1 First shipload (first burn)
• ST - Sorbent trap sample
• 714 - Date sample was taken, i.e., 7/14/77
t F Fuel oil was being burned.
3.7 WASTE DESCRIPTION
In addition to Herbicide Orange, the waste incinerated contained diesel fuel,
which was used to rinse drums and other equipment used in dedrumming and handling
the herbicide, and water-contaminated herbicide. Table 8 lists physical proper-
