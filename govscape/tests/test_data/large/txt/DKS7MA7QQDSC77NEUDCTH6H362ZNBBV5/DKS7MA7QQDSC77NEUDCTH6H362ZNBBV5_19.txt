U.S. Air Force Occupational and Environmental Health Laboratories (OEHL)
at Kelly and Brooks Air Force Bases, Texas, analyzed miscellaneous samples from
both land based and at-sea operations. BCL and WSU analyzed a variety of sam-
ples intended to determine the effect of U.S. EPA approved ship cleaning proce-
dures after waste incineration had been completed. The TRW sampling team
leader had been designated by the U.S. EPA to monitor that portion of the ship
cleaning performed while the TRW team was still onboard the ship.
The final responsibility of TRW to the U.S. EPA was to prepare a final
report assembling and evaluating all data relating to incineration operations
so as to determine compliance with those permit conditions concerning at-sea
operations.
1.3 SUMMARY
Incineration of the herbicide took place in a U.S. EPA-designated burn
zone approximately 120 miles west of Johnston Atoll, as defined by the follow-
ing coordinates: 15°45' to 17°45' N latitude and 171°30' to 173°30' W longi-
tude. The relationship of the burn zone to Johnston Atoll and the Hawaiian
Islands is shown in Figure 1.

A total of 10,400 metric tons (8780 m , 2.31 million gallons) of waste was
burned, requiring 714 hours. The average incineration rate was 14.5 metric
tons per hour or 7.3 metric tons per hour per incinerator. For all three burns,
the average flame temperature was 1500°C as determined by daily optical pyrom-
eter measurements. The average incinerator wall temperature (controller
thermocouple) was 1273°C for all three burns. For the three burns, the average
combustion effluent flow rate per incinerator was calculated to be 70,700 cubic
meters per hour (dry gas at 20°C). Given these average conditions of combustion
air and waste feed rates and temperature, the average calculated incinerator
residence time was 1.0 second. The incinerator residence time was the time
available for a waste molecule to be converted to combustion products.
Stack sampling operations utilized a USAF-OEHL benzene impinger train and
a modified U.S. EPA Method 5 train (Lear-Siegler) which incorporated an organic
vapor sorbent trap. The USAFrOEHL train was the primary train for acquiring
samples for TCDO analysis, whereas the Laar-Siegler train was used to acquire
samples to be analyzed for organic species potentially present in the combustion
