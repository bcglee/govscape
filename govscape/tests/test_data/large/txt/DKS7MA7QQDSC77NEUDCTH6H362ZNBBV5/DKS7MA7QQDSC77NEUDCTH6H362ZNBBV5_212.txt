2. Plot average retention times as abscissae versus normal boil-
ing points as ordinates.
3. Draw in calibration curve.
47 "locate and record retention times corresponding to boiling
ranges (90-110°, 110-140°, 140-160°, 160-180°, 180-200°,
200-220°, 220-240°, 240-260°, 260-280°, 280-300°C).
Response-Amount Cali bration
The required data for this calibration are on the data sheet. The data
reduction is performed thusly:
1. Average the area response of decane from each standard and
calculate relative standard deviations,
2. Plot response (yV • sec) as ordinate versus ng/yl as
abscissae.
3. Draw in the curve. Perform least squares regression and
obtain slope (yV • sec • yl/ng).
C7-C16 Analysis
The required data from the analyses are on the data sheet. The data reduc-
tion is performed thusly:
1. Sum the areas of peaks in the proper retention time ranges.
2. Convert areas (yV • sec) to ng/yl by dividing by the proper
weight response (yV • sec • yl/ng).
3. Obtain total volume of extract. Multiply each weight by total
extract volume to get weight of species in each range in the
sample.
4. If the volume of gas sampled or the total weight of sample
acquired is available, convert result of Step 3 above to
mg/nr.
Precision and Accuracy
Even a crude error propagation analysis is beyond the scope of this proce-
dure. With reasonable care, peak area reproducibility of a standard should be
of the order of 1% RSD. The relative standard deviation of the sum of all
peaks in a fairly complex waste might be of the order of 5-10%. Accuracy is
more difficult to assess. With good analytical technique, accuracy and preci-
sion should be of the order of 10-20%.
