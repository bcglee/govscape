Note: Estimated flame temperature is assumed to be 100 C lower than the calculated adiabatic flame temperature.
The 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T emission rates are based on 99.99% destruction efficiency of these herbicide
components. The lower range of estimated TCDD emissions corresponds to a 2 ppmw of TCDD in Herbicide
ro Orange, and the upper range corresponds to a 47 ppmw of TCDD in Herbicide Orange.
