The samples of 8/28/77 were acquired while flashing the water in Tank 6P
during the third burn (Section 3.2.3). Flashing was performed through the star-
board incinerator. The contents of Tank 6P were fed into burner No. 4, and
herbicide from other tanks was fed into burners 5 and 6 (see Figure 5). The
composite feed sample of 8/28/77 was acquired at burner No. 4, the only burner
fitted with a valve for drawing samples. Therefore, this composite feed sample
was not representative of the waste being burned during the test. It is necessary
to assume a representative composite feed sample in order to determine destruction
efficiencies for 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T and TCDD. Details of the assumed representative
composite feed are described below.
The composite feed sample of 8/28/77 consisted of two layers. WSU made
the following measurements on this sample:
• Top layer - water
1) specific gravity 1.02 g/cm
2) TCDD concentration 0.77 ug/cm
3) volume percent 70%
• Bottom layer - herbicide
" • ' ' ' - '' 3
1) specific,gravity 1.2 g/cm
2) TCDD concentration 2.8 yg/cm3
3) volume percent 30%
Because feed rates by tank could not be determined during the third burn
(Section 4.1.2), the average waste flow rate was used in the calculations. The
overall waste feed rate for the third burn was 15.2 metric tons per hour or
2.53 metric tons per burner per hour (6 burners). The specific gravity
(Section 4.1.2) was 1.19 g/cm , so that the average volume flow rate was 2.13
3
m /hr per burner. Thus, burners 5 and 6 were fed herbicide at an assumed rate
of 2.53 metric tons per hour each; and burner 4 was fed a mixture of 70% water
and 30% herbicide at an assumed rate of 2.13 cubic meters per hour. From these
