8. With a mlcroplpette, transfer 0.25 ml of the concentrate to
a vial. This aliquot 1s for the qualitative GC/MS analyses.
Label the vial appropriately (e.g., run No., date, next
analyses).
9. Return the vial to the sample bank.
4. GRAVIMETRIC DETERMINATIONS FOR ORGANICS
Scope and Application
The purpose of this procedure Is to determine the weight of nonvolatile
organic species 1n samples for Level I organic analyses. The procedure is
performed on the concentrates obtained from the Kuderna-Danish-concentrations
of solvent extract and rinse samples. Weights of organic residues down to
0.001 mg can be measured.
Summary of Method
An 0.5 ml aliquot of the concentrate sample is transferred with a pipette
to a tared aluminum weighing dish. The sample is allowed to evaporate to dry-
ness, stored in a desiccator overnight and weighed.
Sample Handling
All equipment that contacts either the concentrate or evaporated residue
samples is to be glass, Teflon, or stainless steel. Evaporation of the sam- "
pies is to be carried out in an area free from airborne dust and/or organic
vapors that could contaminate the samples.
Apparatus
• Microbalance, Mettler M5 or equivalent.
• Stainless steel disiccating cabinet with gasket sealed closure.
• 500 pi syringe.
• Aluminum weighing dishes.
Reagents
• Phosphorus pentoxide, granular, reagent grade.
• Pentane, distilled-in-glass or Nanograde.
