present in Herbicide Orange (and which elute from the GC) and to identify any
other compound found. Ttblt 11 shows the average composition of four lots of
Herbicide Orange/3'
Sensitivity
The GC/MS sensitivity varies with several parameters including the type of
compound, instrument internal cleanliness, resolution of closely eluting peaks,
etc. Under "everyday" operating conditions 10 nanograras (ng) eluting in a peak
about 5 seconds wide will yield an MS signal with a usable signal-to-noise ratio
of greater than 10 to 1. A dynamic range of greater than 100,000 is achievable.
Detection Limit
There will typically have to be at least 100 ug of material extracted from
a sample and concentrated to 10 ml of solution. This presumes a lyl sample
injection volume and the typical instrument sensitivity specified above.
Interferences
This analysis is performed using the MS in a Total Ion Monitoring mode
(TIM). In this mode, all ion fragments in a specified mass range are monitored
and, as a result, all compounds are detected if they elute from the GC in
detectable quantities. .Because 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are expected to be present in
higher quantities than other species, some spectral interference may result if
other species elute at or near the same time as 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Computer
data manipulation techniques, such as ion mapping, can minimize interferences.
Information exists on the chemical composition of Herbicide Orange, and the
known herbicide components will be specifically sought.
Summary,of Method
This is a combined gas chromotography/mass spectrometry method (GC./MS).
Microliter quantities of concentrated sample extracts are used for this analy-
sis. The concentrated extracts result from the extraction of the various sam-
ples obtained from the sampling activity. The extraction and concentration
procedures are specified elsewhere in this document.
Microliter sized samples are injected onto a gas chromatographic column
and are separated by the differences in the retention characteristics between
the sample components and the column material. As the mixture components elute
