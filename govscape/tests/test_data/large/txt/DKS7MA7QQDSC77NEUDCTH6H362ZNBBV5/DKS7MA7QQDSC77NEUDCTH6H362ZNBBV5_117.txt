precautions which were instituted for the protection of personnel involved in
the at-sea incineration. The physiological activity and toxicological proper-
ties of 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and TCDO are discussed in detail in Appendix 8.
The methods of entry into the body of both Herbicide Orange and TCDD are
by ingestion, absorption through the skin, and inhalation.
5.1 DESIGN OF THE PERSONNEL PROTECTION PLAN
From an operational standpoint, the M/T Vulcanus, pictured in Figure 2 and
shown schematically in Figure 17, consists of several functionally discrete
parts, each devoted to a specific operation, such as waste storage, propulsion,
combustion, and living quarters. Herbicide Orange was handled in the storage
and combustion areas.
The living quarters, mess hall, galley, and recreation areas are located
between the tankage area (forward) and the combustion room (aft). The location
of the various functional portions of the ship are shown in Figure 17. The
crew of 18 and the test and observation team of 8 were allowed to move freely
about the ship in performing their duties, and to return to the living area for
meals, sleep, and recreation. This situation could have resulted in bringing
toxic materials into the living quarters unless specific preventive procedures
were established.
A personnel protection plan was, therefore, designed to isolate the toxic
material in the storage and combustion areas, protect personnel from possible
contamination, and prevent the spread of Herbicide Orange into other portions
of the ship. Important considerations in the selection of this personnel pro-
tection plan were the:
• Confined nature of a shipboard operation
• Centralization of living quarters
• Percutaneous, ingestion, and inhalation paths of exposure

It was considered mandatory that working personnel be free of contamination
before returning to eating and living facilities in order to avoid exjxwire of
others not normally required to come in contact with the chemicals and to pre-
vent .additional exposure risk to themselves. A boundary-isolation method was
selected as the most effective technique for excluding Herbicide Orange from
