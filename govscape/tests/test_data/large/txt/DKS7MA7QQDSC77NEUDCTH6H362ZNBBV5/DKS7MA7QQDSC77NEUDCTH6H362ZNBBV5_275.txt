It is assumed that calculations of destruction efficiency are
normally distributed. The question asked is what percent of
a group of destruction efficiency calculations will be less
than some specified value and what degree of confidence is
there in that estimate of the percentage.
V
There are three values for emission rates of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T
-t
given in Table 51. Safety considerations dictate considera-
tion of destruction efficiencies less than some specified
value. This value is defined as the one-sided tolerance
limit. The value for the one-sided tolerance factor was
selected(l) for the population of three analyses such that
there would be 95% confidence that not more than 0.1% of
2,4-D + 2,4,5-T destruction efficiencies would be less than
the tolerance limit. In other words, the tolerance limit
is such that there is 95% confidence that only one 2,4-0 +
2,4,5-T destruction efficiency in 1000 would be smaller in
value.
K = 13.86, one-sided tolerance factor for
n * 3 at 95% confidence
The tolerance limit is
DE/100 - sK = 0.99999971 - 13.86 x 4.482 x 10"7
= 0.9999935
Therefore, this conservative statistical analysis shows that
there is 95% confidence that not more,than 1 measured destruc-
tion efficiency in 1000 would be less than 99.99935%.
Solving Equation (18) with the values in Table 56, the varv
ance and standard deviation of (DE/100) of TCDD are:
-7
V(DE/100) = 1.944 x 10
-4
s(DE/100) * 4.409 x 10
From Equation (17) the mean destruction efficiency for TCDD is
DE/100 = 0.99948
