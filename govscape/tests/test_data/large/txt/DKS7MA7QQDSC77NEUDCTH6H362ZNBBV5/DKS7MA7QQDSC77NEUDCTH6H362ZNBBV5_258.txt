feed rates and the WSU data above, herbicide and TCDD feed rates can be
calculated:
• Burner No. 4
1) water
70% x 2.13 m3/hr x 106 cm3/rn3 x 1.02 g/cm3 x 10"6 g/mt
« 1.52 mt/hr
2) herbicide
30% x 2.13 nn3/hr x 106 cm3/m3 x 1.2 g/cm3 x 10"6 g/mt
« 0.77 mt/hr
3) TCDD, sum of TCDD in water and herbicide
70% x ,2.13 m3/hr x 106 cm3/m3 x 0.77 x 10"6 g/cm3 = 1.15 g/hr
30% x 2.13 m3/hr x 106 cm3/m3 x 2.8 x 10"6 g/cm3 = 1.79 g/hr
• Burners 5 and 6
1) herbicide
2 x 2.53 mt/hr = 5.06 mt/hr
2) TCDD
5.06 mt/hr x 106 g/mt x 2.8 x 10~6 g/cm3 x 1/1.2 g/cm3
* 11.8 g/hr
• The total herbicide feed rate is the sum of feeds through burners
4, 5, and 6: 5.83 mt/hr
• The combustion effluent flow rate calculated from the herbicide
feed rate of 5.83 mt/hr is 51,900 mj/hr (20°C)
• The emission concentration at 0% destruction efficiency of 2,4-D
+ 2,4,5-T is 112 g/m3
t The total TCDD feed rate is the sum of feeds through burners
4, 5, and 6: 14.7 g/hr
• The emission concentration at 0% destruction efficiency of TCDD
is 284
