from the column, they are transported via an instrument interface to the mass
spectrometer. The MS ionizes the components and analyzes the fragments in a
60-650 AMU range. The signal from the mass spectrometer is stored in the mem-
ory of a computer. The computer than searches the stored spectra for close
matches to a library set of spectra. Peaks other than 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are
not specifically quantitated, but relative abudance estimates are reported.
Definitions
ES - External Standard
TIM - Total Ion Monitoring
Sample Handling and Preservation
These samples are organic solutions resulting from extraction and concen-
tration. They are contained in stoppered or septum sealed vials and are 0.25 ml
in volume. These samples are presumed to contain toxic materials, so due care
shall be used in handling all samples and standards. Gloves and fume hoods are
appropriate considerations.
Apparatus
, This section specifies the major pieces of required apparatus. A normal
complement of glassware and implements is assumed.
Automated 6C/MS - Finnigan Corporation, Model 4023 -» Several other qua-
druple or magnetic sector instruments, computer driven, are available to per-
form this analysis. Basic required capabilities include:
t Resolution sufficient to obtain unit.mass peaks in the
50-650 range (typically 1000)
• Capability for 6-mm ID glass packed columns and a sample
enrichment device to achieve yields and efficiencies such
that the 10 ng total instrument sensitivity is achieved..
• Electron multiplier detection system.
• Total Ion Monitoring capability in the 50-650 range.
Interactive Da ta. System —Capable of gathering and storing TIM data,
enhancing data, generating total ion chromatograms, and spectral searching for
library spectra of known compounds.
