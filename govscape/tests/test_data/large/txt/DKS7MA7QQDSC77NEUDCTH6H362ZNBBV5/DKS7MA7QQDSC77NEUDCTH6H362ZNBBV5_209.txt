10. Verify the %lectrometer is functioning properly, The electrom-
eter will be balanced at least once each day, Bucking controls
will be set as required,
11. Verify recorder and integrator are functioning properly,
12. Leak check the septa, Leak checking is effected by placing
the soap bubble flow meter inlet tube over the injection port
adpators. Septa are replaced after two days use,
13. Obtain list of samples to be run.
Retention Time Calibration —
To obtain the temperature ranges for reporting the results of the analyses,
the chromatograph is given a normal boiling point-retention time calibration.
The n-alkanes, their boiling points, and data reporting ranges are given in
Table C-l.
