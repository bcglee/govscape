Even using a heated gas stream in the air cooling portion of the probe did not
^appreciably change the sample gas outlet temperature. The result of this prob-
lem probably was the collection of a larger fraction of high boiling point
materials in the probe than would be collected at the higher (150° to 200°C)
operating temperature. This problem was circumvented by more frequent rinsing
of the probe. Because the ship was rolling between 10 to 20 degrees from
vertical, the probe rinsing was difficult.
The vast majority of problems were minor. These were:
« Leaks: A leak at the thermocouple joint of the Lear-Siegler
train was corrected with additional sealant. Transportation
had caused a number of fittings in the pneumatic systems of
the portable laboratory to loosen. The loose fittings were
easily tightened.
• Wireless pickup by onboard instruments. Radio communications
were picked up by the test equipment. In particular, the
onboard gas chromatograph was completely inoperative during
voice or continuous wave transmissions.
• Electrical interference: The solenoid valves on the gas
conditioners gave rise to small signals which were picked
up by the on-line instrumentation recorders.
t Plugs in heat traced lines: Condensate and particu1ate
material shed by the incinerators caused frequent partial
plugs in the heat traced lines. The lines were cleaned
without difficulty.
• Corrosion: The combustion effluent was quite corrosive
because of its HC1 content and corroded stainless steel
fittings; however, no failures occurred.
• Instrument damage: The gas conditioners were ineffective
in removing condensate from the sample stream. The conden-
sate damaged one of the CO analyzers. Rearrangement of the
inlet and outlet manifolds of the on-line instrumentation
prevented further damage.
There were several instances during the first burn when one or more burners
were briefly extinguished (5 to 60 seconds) by water (determined after the burn
to be 99% water, about 1% sodium salts of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, and about 80 ppm
arsenic) floating on top of the herbicide in certain tanks. When flameouts
occurred, pumping from that tank was stopped manually by the Chief Engineer who
switched the incinerators to other waste tanks. The remaining material in that
tank was retained pending resolution after completing the first burn.
