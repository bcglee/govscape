As shown in Figure 8, on-line monitoring was performed on the gas sample stream
after processing by the gas conditioner. In addition, because the Beckman
Model 747 0 analyzer is disabled by HC1 vapors, a soda lime scrubber for acid
2
gas was utilized in the oxygen analyzer sample line as shown. Typical operating
times were from 1 to 3 hours. The system was then switched to ambient air to
purge the conditioners and instruments for approximately 30 to 60 minutes.
3-1.2 Acquisition of Combustion Effluent Samples
Combustion effluent samples were taken from the starboard incinerator using
a quartz-lined, water-cooled, remotely traversed probe'. Flue gases were con-
ducted to the Lear-^Siegler sorbent trap and USAF-OEHL benzene impinger trains
through a 15 m heat traced Teflon® line. The control module for the travers-
ing probe and the two sampling trains were located on the observation deck, the
topmost deck of the Vulcanus. , This deck is located directly above the bridge
and forward of the funnel (Figure 2).
3.1.2.1 Traversing Probe
The common probe for the two sampling trains was a stainless steel jacketed,
water-cooled probe with a quartz liner as shown schematically in Figure 9. The
liner provided an inert surface for the sample gas, and the cooled stainless
steel jacket shielded this gas from extreme combustion temperatures to quench
any further reactions of the sample constituents. Water cooling also protected
the metal probe from warping or otherwise being degraded in the extreme tempera-
tures. Further cooling of the gas was modulated by aspirating an air/water mix-
ture into the space between the steel jacket and quartz liner. The probe was
approximately 4.6 m in length.
Figure 10 shows the water-cooled traversing probe mount installation for
the Vulcanus. Design features for this probe mount are given below:
1) The tip of each probe was remotely pos1t1onable for the amount
of insertion. No adjustment was required for azimuth and
elevation.
2) Insertion positioning accuracy was within ±10 cm by command
from a remote location.
3) The probe mount was attached to the incinerator flange as
shown in Figure 10. The outboard end of the mount assembly
was supported by an A-frame secured to the deck.
