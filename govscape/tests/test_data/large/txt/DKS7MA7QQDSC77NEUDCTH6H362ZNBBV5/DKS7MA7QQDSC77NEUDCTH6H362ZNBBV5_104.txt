4.2.8 Marine Monitoring Results
The biological samples were sorted under a microscope, where necessary, to
the species level. Identification of some of the species found was difficult
because of the paucity of historical collection leading to verified identifies- .
tion of the marine biota in this type of tropical oceanic environment. Never-
theless, it was possible to identify all but a few of the species present.
There were slight differences in the species composition among all of the sam-
ples, but there was no consistent difference between pre-bum and post-burn
tows. It should be noted that the results on copepods from these samples are
not essentially different from those obtained on copepods by the USFS Albatross
in the period 1887-1909, which are the only other data available on this area
of the Pacific.
4.2.9 Onboard Analyses
Instrumentation for onboard analysis consisted of two Shimadzu GC-6AMPFE(s)
gas chromatographs, a Shimadzu E1A data processor, and a Shimadzu R-ll recorder.
Each GC was a modular unit, equipped with dual flame ionization (FI) detectors,
a single electron capture (EC) detector, and a linear temperature programmer.
The data processor was microprocessor-controlled and user programmed. The
columns were 2 m x 6 mm DD x 2.9 mm ID glass. Three types of columns were
available: 3% OV-101, 3% OV-17, and 3% OV-225, respectively, on 80/100 mesh
