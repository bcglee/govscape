During the first of the two scheduled stack sampling tests on 24 August,
the purge air line to the on-line instrumentation broke, and the grab gas sam-
ple was not acquired. During this test the only operative hydrocarbon analyzer
ceased functioning. Later it was found that the sample capillary to the flame
detector had become plugged. The sample capillary from the inoperative HC
analyzer was installed, but after a short operating period it too became
plugged. Both HC analyzers were then inoperative. The two operable CO ana-
lyzers had problems, one tended to drift upwards in scale because of condensa-
tion in the sample cell, and the other instrument became too noisy to operate.
On-line monitoring was limited to 1 hour per day because of these problems.
At the end of the first test, the brake on the traversing probe failed,
and the probe moved part way into the stack. Coolant water was still flowing,
and the probe, after removal from the stack, was found to be undamaged. When
not actually in use, the probe was thereafter tied to the probe mount to pre-
clude inadvertent insertion into the stack.
After docking at Johnston Island on 4 September, all TRW equipment was
removed from the M/T Vulcanus for shipment back to the mainland.
3.3 MARINE MONITORING
Plankton samples were collected in the burn site before and after the first
burn. The initial samples were collected near the eastern boundary of the site
on 15 July 1977 before incineration was started. The first plankton tow was
conducted 5 hours before sunrise and the second tow 4 to 5 hours after sunset.
After completing incineration of the first shipload of Herbicide Orange,
plankton tows were made at least 64.3 km (40 mi) downwind of the site of last
burning. The ship was allowed to drift during the post-burn tows. Plankton
tows were conducted 4 to 5 hours after sunrise and 4 to 5 hours after sunset
on 24 July. All plankton samples were placed in quart jars, labeled, and pre-
served with formalin for analysis by the U.S. EPA.

Workspace air monitors consisted of four MSA personnel samplers stationed
in the dining room, pump room, portable laboratory on the main deck, and
