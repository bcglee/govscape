The equilibrium product distribution from the combustion of Herbicide
Orange was determined using the TRW Chemical Analysis Program (CAP), This pro-
gram is capable of simultaneously considering a maximum of 200 gaseous products
together with a maximum of 20 condensed species, and is based on solving a sys-
tem of simultaneous equations of elemental mass balances and a pressure match
which satisfies equilibrium relationships for all reactions and minimizes the
system free energy. The results of the thermochemical computations are sum-
marized in Table D-2. The effects of air/waste ratio and temperature on the
equilibrium product distribution are discussed below.
Effects of Air/Waste Ratio
As indicated in Table D-2, the major equilibrium products under excess air
conditions are CQ , H 0, HC1, N and 0 . The major equilibrium products under

oxygen deficient conditions are CO, C0 , H , H 0, HC1, N and 0 . In addition,

the formation of C0 , Cl, C1 , H 0, 0 and OH is favored at higher air/waste

ratios, and the formation of CO and H is favored at lower air/waste ratios.

In particular, CO will appear in considerable concentrations when the air supply
is below the stoichiometric requirement. At an air/Herbicide Orange feed ratio
of 4.211, for example, the equilibrium CO concentrations are in the 6.6 to
7.9 mole percent range. Even under excess air conditions, however, improper
mixing of combustibles such as CO and air will lead to localized air deficient
pockets and result in high CO emission levels. Thus measured CO concentrations
at the incinerator exit can be used to provide a good indication of the degree
of mixing between combustibles and air in the incinerator. Since the percent
combustion efficient * (1 - CO concentration/C0 concentration) x 100, the
2
requirement for high combustion efficiency also implies low CO concentration
and a high degree of mixing between combustibles and air. In this sense, com-
bustion efficiency as defined here can also be interpreted as a measure of the
degree of mixing between combustibles and air.
Effects of Temperature
The results of the thermochemical calculations indicate that the formation
of CO, Cl, NO and OH is favored by increasing the reaction temperature, whereas
the formation of C0 and C1 is favored by decreasing the reaction temperature.

Increasing the reaction temperature also favors the formation of H under excess
2
air conditions and the formation of H 0 under oxygen deficient conditions. In
