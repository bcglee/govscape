During the third burn, there was another spill of herbicide, indicated as
Spill 2 on Figure 19, At this time, the bow of the ship was riding high because
several forward tanks were empty. The ship also had been given a steep list to
port to help drain the tank which was then being emptied. The best recollection
is that the spill came from Tank 4C which was filled with TCDD-free herbicide.
The Butterworth hatch was open, and several sharp rolls spilled on the order of
10 to 20 liters of rinsate onto the deck. Because of the bow-high and port-list
attitude of the ship, the spilled rinsate ran toward the rear of the ship, stop-
ping at the entry to the port companionway. Shortly after the spill, the deck
was washed with seawater. Wipe samples taken after the spill showed traces of
herbicide (rinsate) in the designated clean areas of the ship. The living
quarters and the port and starboard companionways were cleaned and resampled.

A much smaller spill of TCDD-free herbicide rinsate occurred from the hatch
of Tank 5S. There was a slight list to starboard at the time. The tank was
overfilled for the rolling conditions. Perhaps 0.5 to 1 liter of rinsate spilled
onto the deck before filling could be stopped. The spill was flushed into the
sea. This spill is indicated as Spill 3 in Figure 19.
Because every tank was filled with TCDD-free herbicide.during the third
burn, it is likely that the main deck around all hatch covers was contaminated.
The rolling of the ship (the weather was bad and the seas were high) caused the
tank contents to slosh vigorously. It is expected that small amounts-of TCDD-
free herbicide rinsate spray could have escaped from tanks as they became nearly
full.
During all three burns, the waste tanks were gauged manually with a coiled
steel tape. Drips of herbicide occurred despite the use of a rag to wipe the
tape as it was removed from a tank.
The main deck thus appears to have been the source of contamination which
was spread into other areas of the ship (see wipe sample results for 2 August
and 29 August in Tables 46 and 47, respectively). The corrective action taken
after herbicide appeared in the living quarters was effective.
