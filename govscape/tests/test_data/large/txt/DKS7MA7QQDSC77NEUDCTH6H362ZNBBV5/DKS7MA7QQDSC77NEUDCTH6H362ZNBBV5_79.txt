The results of the GC/MS analyses of the waste feeds are given in Table 23.
This analysis was quantitative for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T to an accuracy of ± factor
of 2, Quantitation of other identified compounds is ± factor of 10. Each feed
was analyzed after first having been diluted a thousandfold with pentane. The
two herbicide feeds were also analyzed neat (i.e., not diluted); both of these
samples were identical. •
4.2.3.2 Analysis of Lear-Siegler Train Samples
After sample penetration, a 0.5-ml aliquot of each concentrate was evap-
orated to constant weight to obtain a mea-sura of nonvolatile residue, that is,
organic compounds boiling at greater than 300°C. The probe and heat-^traced
line rinse samples gave high residue weights. It was decided to determine
whether these residues were partially inorganic. Small portions of the residues
were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These results are given in
Table 24. Because the furnace atmosphere was nitrogen, only organic carbon was
determined; nonorganic carbon (e.g., graphite, carbon black) was not determined.
The weight loss at 300°C was taken as a measure of volatile organics; the weight
loss at 900°C was taken as a measure of the total organic compound content of a
sample. The data in Table 24 show that the nonvolatile residues from the probe
