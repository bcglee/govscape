4.2.3.3 Results of Analyses of Gas Sampl ing Bags
The XAD-2 resin in the sorbent trap does not efficiently collect organic
compounds with boiling points below about 90Â°C. Therefore, samples of combus-
/a\
tion effluent were acquired in Tedlar gas sampling bags. The contents of the
bags were analyzed by the C1-C6 GC procedure. The results are presented in
Table 31. Because of inadvertent delays in transportation, the samples must
be considered compromised. During the several weeks delay between acquisition
and analysis, reactive species are probably lost entirely. Irreversible absorp-
tion and condensation also occur in gas sampling bags and probably occurred in
these. Hydrocarbons were detected at the 10 to 20 ppm level in every test
onboard the M/T Vulcanus, yet only one of the three grab gas samples showed
detectable levels of hydrocarbons.
4-2.3.4 Burner Residue Analyses
The nonvolatile residues obtained from the burner residue extracts were
large, as were the residues from the probe and heat-traced line extracts.
Therefore, thermogravimetric analyses of these residues were also performed.
The results of these analyses are given in Table 32. The analyses show that
the residues from the burner residue extracts are essentially wholly organic in
content.
Table 33 presents the results of the gravimetric analyses of the burner
residue extracts. It is seen that the burner residues have contents of extract-
able nonvolatile organic compounds of from 3.1 to 10.2%. The burner residues
are probably mostly inorganic carbon.
