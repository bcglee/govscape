following months, 228 persons developed chloracne, not only plant employees,
but members, of their families including wives and children, In workers more
intensively exposed as a result of the accident, chloracne appeared about two
weeks followed by moderate to severe pain in the skeletal muscles of the legs,
arms, back and breath, decreased libido and intolerance to cold. Comedones
appeared in areas of adult hair which is not typical of juvenile acne, There
were pustules on the face, neck, abdomen, back and scrotum. Serum lipids,
prothrombin time and glucuronates were all elevated. Biopsy of peripheral
nerves revealed destruction of myelin sheaths and in some instances nerve fibers.
Hyperpigmentation, fatigue and marked nervous irritability appeared. Over a
period of several months, all of the symptoms and findings, except the scars of
acne, returned to normal after removal from exposure. Cases in the families of
the workers probably resulted from contaminated clothing and poor personal
hygiene. The causative agent was not identified at the time. However, in the
light of current knowledge, it was almost certainly a polychlorinated dibenzodi-
oxin and possibly TCDD (Suskind, 1973).
c. Evaluation of Toxicological Testing
,(1) Requirement for Establishing Dose-Related Response: Insistence
on administering a "maximum tolerated dose" may be terribly misleading if this
is the only dose tested, as in the Bionetics study (Innes, e_t al_., 1969). There
is no justification for abrogating the need to establish a dose-response rela-
tionship, which is fundamental to all toxicological experimentation. The route
of administration is all important in tests for teratogenesis. We are told that
"Parenteral administration is an appropriate test route for pesticides to which
humans are exposed by inhalation, or for pesticides which are systemically
absorbed, following ingestion" (USDHEW, 1969). It is safe to predict that, by
appropriate choice of dose, concentration of solution and frequency of adminis-
tration by subcutaneous route, any chemical agent can be shown to be a carcinogen
or a teratogen in the rat and probably in other laboratory rodents (Goldberg,
1971).
(2) Bionetics Study: The Bionetics study began with the observa-
tion that 2,4,5-T was teratogenic and feticidal in two strains of mice when
administered either subcutaneously or orally and in one strain of rats when
administered orally (Courtney et_ a_K, 1970). Analyses of the sample of 2,4,5-T
