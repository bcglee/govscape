The personnel protection procedures described in Section 5 worked satis-
factorily. A boundary-isolation method of excluding Herbicide Orange from
living areas of the ship was used effectively. There were no major exposures
of personnel to Herbicide Orange. Minor exposures occurred during the first
burn when the incinerator exhaust plume impinged on the ship. Brief plume
impingements (5 to 60 seconds) resulted' from burner flameouts caused by a
layer of material (later identified as water with traces of arsenic and sodium
salts of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-rT) floating on top of the waste reaching the burners.
Flameouts were avoided subsequently by switching two of the three burners in
each incinerator to other tanks when nearing depletion of the waste tank being
pumped.
A significant result was derived from on-line monitoring data taken during
a traverse across the starboard stack. It was found that wall effects on the
combustion effluent gas composition from Herbicide Orange incineration were
nonexistent at distances greater than 10 cm from the inside incinerator wall
surface. Therefore, incinerator combustion efficiency could be determined
using a fixed position probe.
The at-sea incineration of Herbicide Orange was successfully completed.
The Permittees complied with all permit conditions related to at-sea operations
in the designated burn zone and listed in Section 1.2.
