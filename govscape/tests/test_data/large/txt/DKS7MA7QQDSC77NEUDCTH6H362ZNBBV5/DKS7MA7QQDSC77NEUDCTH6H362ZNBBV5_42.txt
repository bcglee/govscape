Figure 13. Schematic of USAF-OEHL benzene impinger sampling train.
Orange and during the operation of the sorbent trap train. Because of the sen-
sitivity of TCDD to UV light, benzene impingers were wrapped in aluminum foil.
Once assembled, they were not reopened. Upon completion of the 1-hour sampling
period, contents of the impingers and connectors were transferred to amber glass
containers. Benzene addition, sample removal, and acetone rinsing were accom-
plished by pouring the solvents through the ball joints using a glass or Teflon^
funnel. All rinses were added down the center nozzle to ensure completeness of
rinsing.
Three USAF train samples were taken during each day of stack sampling.
One sample was taken for TCDD analysis by WSU, one sample for analysis of
2,4-D and 2,4,5-T by BCL, and the third sample for onboard analysis of 2,4-D
and 2,4,5-T by TRW.
At the end of the test, the heat traced TeflonÂ® line and probe were
rinsed with acetone and transferred to separate amber glass containers. All
sample containers were stored aboard ship until the test burn was completed.
After the Vulcanus docked at Johnston Island, samples were shipped by the U.S.
Air Force to the proper destination for subsequent analysis.

The sorbent trap train was a modification of a standard Lear-Siegler U.S.
EPA Method 5 train. This sampling train, which has approximately a 1 cfm
