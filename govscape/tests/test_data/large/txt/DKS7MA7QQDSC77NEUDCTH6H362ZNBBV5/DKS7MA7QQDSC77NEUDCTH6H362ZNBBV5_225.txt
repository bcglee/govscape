10. Set the temperature control for the temperature range from
ambient to SQQ^C and the desired temperature program rate.
The rate may be adjusted by the operator at his discretion
to control sample sputtering, etc. Depress the Solid Probe
Selector push-button under the temperature readout to moni-
tor the probe temperature.
11. Start the scanning sequence and data acquisition of the mass
spec/computer to acquire data in accordance with the param-
eters set in Step 9. Then depress the Solid Probe push-
button to start the heating cycle. The probe will1 now heat .
at the selected rate while MS data is acquired, processed,
and stored in the computer.
12. When the probe temperature reaches 300Â°C, stop data acquisi-
tion by pressing the appropriate computer stops. Turn the
solid probe heater off and allow the probe to cool. Then
disconnect the cable from the probe handle and pull the probe
out to the stop. Close the solid inlet valve by turning the
handle clockwise. Loosen the slip vacuum seal knob. Push
down on the stop pin in the guide rod and withdraw the probe.
Elements of data interpretation are. presented here as a checklist of things
to consider.
1. Study all available information about the sample.
2. Verify that the mass counter is accurate.
3. Study the general appearance of the spectrum, e.g., molecular
stability, isotopic abundances indicating some heteroatoms,
rings plus double bonds, characteristic ions.
4. Identify neutral fragments accompanying high mass in forma-
tion (including metastable peaks, if available).
5. Postulate classes of compounds and test against reference
spectra for the same or similar compounds, or spectra pre-
dicted from mechanisms of ion decompositions. Examine the
data from analyses run with the low ionization potentials.
In the analysis mode where low ionization voltages are used (10-15 eV),
the intensity of the peaks caused by apparent molecular ions of "most probable"
identified compounds can be examined to provide an estimate of the abundances
of identified species. Only an estimate can be given because the production
and stability of molecular ions are not equal for all compounds. This type of
estimation is significantly more error prone when 70 eV ionization energies are
used. The estimation procedure is carried out by normalizing all of the
