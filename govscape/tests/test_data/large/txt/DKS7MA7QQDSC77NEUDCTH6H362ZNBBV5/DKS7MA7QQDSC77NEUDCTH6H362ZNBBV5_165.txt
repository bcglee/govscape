FIRST AID IN THE EVENT Op CHEMICAL POISONING
If You Are Along With the Victim...
FIRST - See that the victim is breathing; if not, give artificial
respiration.
SECOND -Decontaminate him immediately i.e., wash him off thoroughly.
Speed is essential!
THIRD -Call your physician.
NOTE: Do not substitute first aid for professional treatment.
First aid is only to relieve the patient before medical
help is reached.
If Another Person Is With You and the Victim...
Speed is essential; one person should begin first aid treatment while the
other calls a physician.
The physician will give you instructions. He will very likely tell you to
get the victim to the emergency room of a hospital. The equipment needed for
proper treatment is there. Only if this is impossible should the physician be
called to the site of the accident.
General
1. Give mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration if breathing has
stopped or is labored.
2. Stop exposure to the poison and if poison is on skin cleanse
the person, including hair and fingernails. If swallowed,
induce vomiting.
3. Save the pesticide container and material in it if any
remains; get readable label or name of chemical(s) for the
physician. If the poison is not known, save a sample of
the vomitus.
