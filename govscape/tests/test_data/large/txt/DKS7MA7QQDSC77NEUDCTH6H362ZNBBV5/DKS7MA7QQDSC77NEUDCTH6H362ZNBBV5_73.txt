where 120 is the volume of an incinerator in m ; 65,838 is the average calcu-
lated combustion effluent flow rate in m /hr at 0°C; and T is the flame tempera-
ture in °K. Incinerator residence times at different flame temperatures
(Appendix F-4) are given below:

4.2 ANALYTICAL RESULTS
The results of laboratory analyses by TRW, WStl, and BCL of samples taken
during the Herbicide Orange program are presented and discussed in this section.
The purpose and scope of laboratory analyses performed by the three contractors
were quite different. The TRW combustion effluent analyses were intended pri-
marily to assure permit conditions were met.
Wright State University analyzed the combustion effluent samples for TCDD
only. The results of their analyses for TCDD were used in deciding to issue a
Special Permit for the second and third burns and to assess the overall accept-
ability of the incineration based on the destruction efficiency for TCDD.
BatteHe-Columbus analyzed benzene impinger samples for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T
in order to give rapid confirmation of shipboard analyses. BCL also analyzed
workspace air monitor samples and ship's drinking water samples for 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T.
The analytical methodology used by each of the three contractors is
described briefly in this section.
