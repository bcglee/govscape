maximum liquid 'waste rate of 12 tonnes/hr stipulates a minimum air/Herbicide
Orange feed ratio of 6,25 m air per kg of Herbicide Orange, It has been
pointed out that this minimum air/Herbicide Orange feed ratio corresponds to
an estimated" flame temperature of 1840°C and oxygen level of 3.0% in the com-
bustion product gas. At higher air/Herbicide Orange feed ratios, the estimated
flame temperature decreases and the oxygen level in the qombustion product gas
o
increases. At an air/Herbicide Orange feed ratio of 10.56 m air per kg of
Herbicide Orange, the estimated flame temperature is 1150°C and the oxygen
level in the combustion product gas is approximately 9.9%. Since a minimum
temperature of 1000°C is necessary to ensure the near complete destruction of
3
TCDD,V ' air/Herbicide Orange fe'ed ratios exceeding 10.56 m air per kg of
Herbicide Orange should not be considered for Herbicide Orange incineration.

At an air feed rate of 75,000 m/hr, the recommended Herbicide Orange feed rate
to each Vulcanus incinerator is 7.1 to 9.6 tonnes/hr. The higher Herbicide
Orange feed rate is the preferred mode of operation because the resulting higher
flame temperature would lead to more rapid evaporation of the liquid herbicide
droplets as well as faster chemical reaction rates.
In Table D-5, the estimated emission rates and concentrations for 2,4-D,
2,4,5-T and TCDD from Herbicide Orange incineration on Vulcanus are presented.
/The 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T emission rates were estimated on the basis of 99.99%
destruction efficiency for these herbicide components. The TCDD emission rates
were estimated at both 99 and 99.9% destruction efficiency, for TCDD concentra-
tions of 2 to 47 ppmw in Herbicide Orange. As shown in Table D-5, the estimated
TCDD concentration in the incinerator effluent is in the 0.14 to 4.23 ppb range
at 99% destruction efficiency, and the estimated 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T concentration
in the incinerator effluent is 350 to 520 ppb.
In summary, the analysis of existing test data and the theoretical analysis
performed by Arthur D. Little have shown that the TCDD present in Herbicide
Orange can be successfully destroyed with the Vulcanus incinerator. The best
estimate for the TCDD destruction efficiency is 99.9%. To assure high TCDD
destruction efficiencies, combustion efficiencies in excess of 99.9% are deemed
necessary as an indication that there is adequate mixing between combustibles
and air and the combustion process is complete.
