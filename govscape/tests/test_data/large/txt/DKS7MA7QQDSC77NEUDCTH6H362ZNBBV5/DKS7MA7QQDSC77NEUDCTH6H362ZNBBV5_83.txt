A measure of the volatile organic compound content of the Lear-Siegler
train samples was obtained from.the C7-C16 GC procedure. Results of these anal-
yses are presented in Table 27 which gives, as emission concentrations, the
amounts of material detected in each boiling point range and the total chroma-
tographable organic content. It is seen from the results in Table 27 that the
probe and heat-traced lines rinse samples had substantial quantities of chroma-
tographable organic compounds. Although these analyses were performed on neat
(unconcentrated) portions of the samples, water and aqueous HC1 are not detected
and do not contribute to the total chromatographable organic content.
In the Level I organic analysis scheme, if a residue weight, calculated at
the source, exceeds a certain concentration (0.5 mg/m and O.I mg/kg for liquids
and solids), then a suitably sized portion of the extract is taken for liquid
chromatographic separation. The separation yields eight fractions, each of
which contains reasonably distinct classes of organic compounds. This simpli-
fies the identification of compound classes and gives an estimate of the amounts
of compound classes present in the sample. Each fraction is evaporated to con-
stant weight. Nonvolatile residue weight is recorded, and an infrared spectrum
is measured on each residue.
