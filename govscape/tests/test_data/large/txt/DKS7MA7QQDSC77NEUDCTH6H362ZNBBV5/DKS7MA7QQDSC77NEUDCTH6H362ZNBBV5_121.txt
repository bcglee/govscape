analysis for 2,4-D an* 2,4,5-T. Figure 17 shows the location of the wipe samples
on a plan view of the M/T Vulcanus. Results of these analyses, given in detail
in Table 44 (first burn), Table 45 (second burn), and Table 46 (third burn) show
that good segregation of the herbicide was achieved during the first burn and
that the galley and living quarters were free of herbicide.
However, because of minor spills (Section 5.5.2) during tank sampling before
the second burn, the main deck around tank access hatches became contaminated.
The presence of waste in living quarters and entry passageways was immediately
detected by wipe sampling (Table 45). Scrubbing the interior floors and hosing
the passageways reduced herbicide in these areas to below detection limits.
The presence of TCDD-free herbicide was detected in living quarters and
entry passageways during the third burn (Table 46). This contamination was
caused by minor spills of TCDD-free herbicide (Section 5.5.2). The amounts of
2
TCDD-free herbicide found were very low, estimated to be <10 yg/m .
5.3.2 Workspace Air Monitors
Workspace air was monitored in the dining room, combustion room, pump room,
and portable laboratory. The.se samples were analyzed, and the results are given
in Tables 39 and 40.
•Results of the analyses show that concentrations of herbicide in the four
0
areas monitored were low, from 0.06 to 174 yg/m , during all three burns. High-
est concentrations were found in the pump room, a not unexpected situation. In
chemical tankers, this room is the chief source of fumes from the cargo being
handled. The permitted concentrations of Herbicide Orange of 2.0 mg/m/16 hours
and 10.0 mg/m /8 hours are greater than 1 order of magnitude above the concen-
trations found in the pump room, where personnel exposure was infrequent and of
short duration.
In the combustion room, where the ambient temperatures were 200°F in some
areas, the permitted concentrations of herbicide were greater than 1 order of
magnitude above the measured values. In the living area and portable laboratory,
the permitted concentrations of herbicide were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude above
the measured values. In all areas tested, it is evident that personnel were
adequately protected with a large safety factor from toxic levels of Herbicide
Orange in workspace air.
