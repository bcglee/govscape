(3) Acute Toxicity: One of the essential prerequisites in the
selection of a herbicide for defoliation programs is selective toxicity. Orange
herbicide is characterized by a low order of toxicity to man and terrestrial
animals. When properly applied, chlorophenoxy herbicides have presented very
minimal hazards to animal life in target areas. The acute oral toxicity of
Orange herbicide is summarized below. The data are expressed as LDr s in units

of mg of chemical per kg of body weight. This is the single oral dose which
was lethal for 50% of the test species. Orange herbicide LDc : rat 566,

sheep 250 and cattle 250. The oral toxicities of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are quite
similar to those of Orange herbicide (e.g., the acute oral LD of 2,4-D and
50
2,4,5-T in the rat are 620 and 480 mg./kg, respectively). Table B-l and B-2
summarize the results of several acute toxicity studies with various salt, ester
and amine forms of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
(4) Chronic Toxicity: Because of the active secretion of chloro-
phenoxy herbicides, rather large amounts must be administered over a long period
of time to produce symptoms of toxicity. Enormous amounts of Orange herbicide
were.applied to test plots at Eglin AFB without visible toxic effects or develop- .
ment of herbicide residues in the native animals in the test plots (Young, 1973).

In one study, (Palmer and Radeleff, 1964) sheep were given 2 gm of the acid
daily and sacrificed on the day following the final dose. Residues in the tis-
sues were less than 1 ppm in all tissues and usually less than 0.05 ppm, which
was the sensitivity of the analytical method. Mitchell and co-workers (1946)
pastured sheep and cattle on treated foliage without harmful effects to the
animals. They also fed a lactating cow 5.5 gm of 2,4-D daily for 106 days with-
out producing poisoning. Palmer (1963) found that cattle were not harmed by
112 daily doses (administered 5 days each week) of 5 mg/kg of alkanolamine salt
and that 44 daily doses of 200 mg/kg or 20 doses of 250 mg/kg were required to
produce fatal poisoning. Palmer Radeleff (1964) reported that sheep were given
481 daily doses of 100 mg/kg doses of 2,4-D without producing poisoning.
2,4,5-T has not been investigated as thoroughly as 2,4-D, but the reaction of
cattle and sheep to massive doses would indicate that absorption and excretion
must follow a similar pattern. A study by Palmer and Radeleff (1964) showed
that sheep required 369 doses of 100 mg/kg each to induce intoxication. The
above results are summarized in Table B-3.
