v 'HC Analyzer was inoperative during third burn
and not inadequate incinerator performance caused the marginal destruction
efficiencies. The extremely high destruction efficiencies for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T
during the second burn (Section 6) support this contention.
Mostly glass components were incorporated in the sampling trains which
stood up well to the corrosive (HC1) combustion effluent, The on-line ana-
lyzer system functioned adequately and maintained adequate sensitivity for
measuring combustion gases. Some damage to the CO and hydrocarbon analyzers
occurred from the corrosive gases passing through them, necessitating more fre-
quent maintenance and calibration. The damage was caused by an engineering
oversight which left a cold spot in the system. Condensation thus occurred,
and it was the condensate that damaged the instruments. No effects from the
unusual shock vibration or saltwater environment were noted.
Incinerator controls and instrumentation were adequate. Redundant incin-
erator wall thermocouples would be desirable from an operational standpoint
because loss of wall thermocouples would shut off incineration and because they
cannot be replaced while the incinerators are hot.
