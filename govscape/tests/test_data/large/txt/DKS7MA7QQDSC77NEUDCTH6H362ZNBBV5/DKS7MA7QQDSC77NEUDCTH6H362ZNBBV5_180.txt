most instances, The aquatic animal absorbs the herbicide which is distributed
throughout his total environment (absorption is mainly via gills in fish),
Then, the differences in renal function must be considered, Generally, non-
mammlian aquatic animals do not have highly developed kidneys, Thus, once the
herbicide is in the aquatic animal's body, some metabolic changes must occur
in the molecule to make it more polar if it is to be excreted. Toxicity testing
is also necessarily different with aquatic animals. Usually, aquatic animals
are placed in a concentration of the toxicant to gradually absorb the material
at a rate depending on the animal's physiology and the behavior of the toxicant
in the particular water conditions. Therefore, the actual dose to each animal
is not known in most studies with aquatic animals. In contrast, toxicity stud-
ies with terrestrial animals usually allow calculation of a known dose per unit
weight of each animal. Thus, toxicities are often reported as "LD " (Lethal
XX ~~""
Dose) for terrestrial animals and "LC " (Lethal Concentration) for aquatic

(b) Metabolism in Fish: Donald P. Shultz (Fish-Pesticide
Research Laboratory, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, 1973) studied the

uptake, distribution, and dissipation of C-label dimethyl amine salt of
2,4-D (DMA-2,4-D). Three species of fish were exposed to 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/1
concentrations of herbicide for up to 84 days exposure period. No mortalities
occurred, nor were adverse biological effects observed at these exposure levels.
The highest radioactive residue found in muscle tissue occurred in Bluegills
exposed to 2.0 mg/1 for 84 days (1.065 mg/kg). However, gas-liquid chromatog-
raphy indicated that over 90% of the radioactive residues consisted of metab-
olites of 2,4-D. The major metabolite in the fish was found to be 2,4-D glu-
curonic acid conjugate. Current investigations have found at least six
metabolites of 2,4-D in fish. Thus, in contrast to many of the organochlorine
pesticides which undergo biomagnification through the food chain, DMA-2,4-D is
metabolized in fish without accumulation of the parent compound.
(2) Behavior in Aquatic Systems
(a) Solubility Limits and Rates Vs. Hydrolysis Rates: The
esters of 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T found in Orange herbicide have a very limited solu-
bility in water. Because of this very low solubility, the actual concentrations
of esters produced in a body of water by accidental contamination would likely
