APPENDIX D
1. EQUILIBRIUM PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION ANALYSES
The purpose of the equilibrium product theoretical computation is to define
the practical bounds for the safe operation of the Vulcanus incinerators during
the destruction of Herbicide Orange. In the combustion studies. Herbicide
Orange was assumed to have the following composition: c, 49.1 wt %; H, 4.6 wt %\
0, 16.4 wt %; Cl 29.9 wt %. The equilibrium product distributions from Herbi-
cide Orange incineration were examined at four temperature levels (1000°C,
1250°C, 1500°C, and adiabatic flame temperature) and for four air/waste ratios.
As indicated in Table D-l, the four air/waste ratios examined correspond to
approximately 3.0, 6.5, and 10,0 mole percent of oxygen in the stack gas and to
a case where only 80 percent of the air required for stoichiometric combustion
is fed. The 80 percent stoichiometric air case was designed to determine the
equilibrium product distribution under oxygen deficient conditions.
