personnel participating in the incineration of Herbicide Orange on board the
M/T Vulcanus. All personnel on board ship will adhere to the provisions of
this plan during all phases of the anticipated three incineration burns. TRW
will brief officers and crew members of the M/T Vulcanus with this safety plan
data and procedures. This is particularly important with regard to personal
â€¢fiygiene,equipmentmalfunctions, spills and criteria for terminating a given
bgrn. Due to the inherent confinement while at-sea, and required interaction
-of- TRW and Vulcanus personnel, a thorough understanding of the contents of this
document is mandatory on the part of all concerned.
The scope of the safety plan is limited to shipboard operations. Specifi-
cally excluded are the safety requirements for Herbicide Orange de-drumming,
drum cleaning and ship loading operations, which are covered by U.S. Air Force,
U.S. Coast Guard and M/T Vulcanus standard procedures.
To assist in establishing and maintaining safety procedures and routines,
TRW will designate a Safety Director for ocean incineration operations. This
individual will be a member of the TRW sampling and monitoring team. His duties
will include: safety procedure briefing of all ship's personnel; monitoring the
implementation of this safety plan; and advising .the TRW crew leader, ship's
master and Air Force representative regarding corrective action for unsafe con-
ditions or incidents.
