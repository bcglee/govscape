ABSTRACT
This report describes at-sea incineration of approximately 10,400 metric
tons of U.S. Air Force-owned Herbicide Orange onboard the incinerator ship
M/T Vulcanus, Incineration took place within a Pacific Ocean burn zone located
West of Johnston Atoll which was designated by the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. Three shiploads of Herbicide Orange were incinerated. The first
shipload was transported from the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Base at
Gulfport, Mississippi, to the burn zone and incinerated under provisions of
U.S. EPA Research Permit No. 770DH001R. Shiploads two and three were subse-
quently taken onboard the Vulcanus at Johnston Island and incinerated under
U.S. EPA Special Permit No. 770DH001S. The U.S. Air Force and Ocean Combus-
tion Services, B.V., The Netherlands (owner of the M/T Vulcanus), were the
•••permittees.
Monitoring, sampling, and analysis of the incineration process to assure
compliance with U.S. EPA permit operating and safety conditions related to
at-sea operations were performed by personnel of TRW. Inc., Redondo Beach,
California. A U.S. EPA representative was onboard the Vulcanus during the
Research Permit burn. A U.S. Air Force representative participated in the
monitoring team activities during all three burns.
Monitoring activities utilized on-line instrumentation to measure carbon
monoxide and dioxide, oxygen concentration, and total hydrocarbons from both
incinerators. These parameters served as a measure of overall combustion effi-
ciency with primary emphasis on the ratio of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide
in the effluent gases. Combustion efficiency exceeded 99.9% during all three
burns. Herbicide Orange was injected into the incineration system at an aver-
age rate of 14.5 metric tons per hour. Optical pyrometer flame temperature
measurements averaged 1500°C. A dwell time of 1.0 second was calculated for
the combustion gases in the incinerators.
