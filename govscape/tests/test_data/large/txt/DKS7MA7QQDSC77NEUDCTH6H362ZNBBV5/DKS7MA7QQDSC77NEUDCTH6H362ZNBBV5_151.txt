3. CRITERIA FOR TERMINATION OF A BURN
Due to the highly toxic nature of the TCDO contaminant present in Herbicide
Orange, the TRW team leader acting on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, shall, in consultation with the cognizant U.S. Air Force represen-
tative, retain the authority to terminate and/or initiate incineration. The
criteria that will be used by the TRW team leader to measure safe shipboard
operation are summarized in Table 3.1 and discussed in the following sections.
These criteria will only be used as guidelines. It should be recognized that,
in addition to the TRW team leader, authority to terminate any individual incin-
eration test shall also rest with any one of the following personnel: U.S. Air
Force designate, or ,the captain of the M/T Vulcanus.
3.1 PLUME IMPINGEMENT
The plume arising from the incinerator stacks will be injected with ammonia
as required to make it visible as necessary. Incineration with Herbicide Orange
will be terminated and shipboard personnel will be withdrawn to a safe area, if
at any time during the test, the plume is observed to remain on the deck of the
M/T Vulcanus even after corrective measures have been attempted.
3.2 HERBICIDE ORANGE SPILLS
Incineration will be terminated if a spill occurs on board the M/T Vulcanus
and cannot be readily contained or cleaned.
3.3 COMBUSTION EFFICIENCY
The CO and COg levels determined at or near the exit plane will be used as
an indication of overall combustion efficiency using the following equation:
C0 concentration - CO concentration
?
% Combustion Efficiency - Q concentration X 10Â°
C 2
Combustion efficiencies in excess of 99.9 percent are deemed necessary as an
indication that high destruction efficiencies for Herbicide Orange constituents
