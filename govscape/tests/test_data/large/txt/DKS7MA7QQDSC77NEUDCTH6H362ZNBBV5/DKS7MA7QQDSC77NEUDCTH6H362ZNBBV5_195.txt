2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, Sllvex or their derivatives is not expec,tsd to produce detectable
amounts of dioxins or dibenzofuran," However, in a memorandum dated July 30,
1973, Baughman and Meselson [1973) reported that the pyrolysis of the sodium
salt of 2,4,5-T at temperatures from 300 to 450Â°C for 30 minutes to 12 hours
caused the formation TCDD ranging in concentrations from 0.1 to 0.3% (1,000
to 3,000 ppm).
d, Evaluation by EPA Advisory Committee: The data are indeed very
limited. Nevertheless, certain conclusions can be made and these as made by
the Advisory Committee on 2,4,5-T to the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency are, in part, as follows:
(1) The herbicide 2,4,5-T does not accumulate in any compartments
of the biosphere, nor does it accumulate in any animal tissues or products used
for human consumption.
(2) The risk of human exposure to 2,4,5-T in food, air and water
is negligible.
(3) There is no indication that TCDO accumulates in air, water or
plants, although it might accumulate and remain active for some time in soils
after heavy application of a highly contaminated sample of 2,4,5-T.
(4) Less than 0.2% of TCDD in soil is known to be absorbed into
plants.
(5) 2,4,5-T is rapidly excreted in animals studied using doses in
the range of those likely to be encountered in the environment.
(6) Limited data indicate that TCDD is also eliminated, at least
some by metabolic breakdown, with a half-life of 20 days.
(7) The solubility of TCDD in fat is limited which would preclude
appreciable accumulation in body fat.
