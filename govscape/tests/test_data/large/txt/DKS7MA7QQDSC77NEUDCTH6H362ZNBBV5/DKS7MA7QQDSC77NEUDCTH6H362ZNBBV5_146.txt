The draft Comprehensive Safety Plan, set forth in Appendix 14 of the Herbi-
cide Orange hearing record of April 7, 1977, was reviewed and revised at a
joint EPA, U.S.A.F., TRW and DCS meeting which was held at Gulfport, Mississippi,
bn May 5, 1977. This document which includes the modifications agreed to at
the .Gulfport meeting is the final plan and has been entered into the record as
Appendix 14. Verbal approval of the final Safety Plan was given by Lt. Col.
John Gokelman, U.S.A.F., on May 17 and by Dr. Ronald A. Venezia, EPA on
May 16, 1977.
If newly acquired scientific data indicate that additional safety provi-
sions or criteria should be included in the plan, EPA, after consultation with
the U.S.A.F. and TRW, will establish such additional provisions or criteria.
