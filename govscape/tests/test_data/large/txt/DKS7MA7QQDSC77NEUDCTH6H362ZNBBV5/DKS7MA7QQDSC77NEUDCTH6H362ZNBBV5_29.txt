Three-way valves are utilized on each burner to provide either waste feed,
fuel oil feed, or a shutoff condition. Waste and fuel oil cannot be valved into
a burner simultaneously; however, alternate burners could be operated with fuel
and waste to achieve higher or lower combustion temperatures if necessary,
depending on the relative heat contents of the fuel oil and waste.
Periodically the burners require cleaning. They are normally cleaned one
at a time with the remaining two firing waste. Cleaning is easily accomplished
because the burners are readily accessible. Each burner has a vertical pivot
so that it can be swung out of the furnace. The opening left by this operation
is temporarily closed by a cover. The burners are cleaned by a metal tool which
is pushed through the burner.
2.4 RECORDING AND CONTROL EQUIPMENT
2.4.1 Waste Measurements
A new measuring system was installed into each tank for the Herbicide
Orange burns. It was a sealed system to prevent waste vapors from escaping.
However, this system proved unsatisfactory because it measured only the top
one-third of each tank and because the tanks had to be vented to atmosphere
in order to pump waste out. Sounding the depth of waste in each tank with a
tape was another method of determining burn rate. Both of these methods were
only useful in port or in calm seas (i.e., minimum ship roll). During the
actual burns, the total time was recorded for emptying each tank and a time
averaged waste feed rate was determined.
2.4.2 Wall Temperature Measurements
Temperatures during operation of the incinerators were measured by two
platinum-platinum/10^ rhodium thermocouples in each incinerator. Each pair is
located in a well opposite one of the burners (Figure 5). One thermocouple is
located approximately 1.3 cm from the inside surface of the refractory lining.
This thermocouple provides temperature information to the automatic waste shut-
off system and is called the controller thermocouple. A second thermocouple,
approximately 4 cm from the inner surface of the firebrick, is referred to as
the "indicator" because it provides temperature information to a panel located
in the incinerator control room and to a panel ("black box") located on the
bridge.
