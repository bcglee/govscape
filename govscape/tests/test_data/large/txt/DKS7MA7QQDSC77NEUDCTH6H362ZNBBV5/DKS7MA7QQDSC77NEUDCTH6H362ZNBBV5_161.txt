more than 20°C at this time and must be restored to at least
the original level of 128Q°C before the next burner is changed
over to Herbicide Orange,
8) Monitoring of the furnaces for temperature, and for complete-
ness of combustion, shall be in effect during the changeover,
The continuous record of temperature shall also be maintained
during this time.
9) The operational controls and monitoring panels shall be manned
at all times by a responsible individual to ensure the incin-
erators are operating within desired combustion parameters.
10) An automatic sealed monitoring device (black box) will be
installed to record incineration activities and temperatures
and camera to photograph the control panel every 15-30 minutes.
In addition, a manual log will also be kept, including:
a) Time, date
b) "Black box" temperature
c) Controller temperature reading
d) Waste feed rates
e) Switching of waste tanks
. f) Wind speed and direction
g) Location
11) A device for addition of ammonia to make a visible plume shall
be installed and operable.
12) The speed and direction of the M/T Vulcanus during waste
incineration shall be controlled in such a manner that the
incinerator plume does not contact any part of the ship at
any time because of wind (eddies) or any other reason. The
M/T Vulcanus shall stay under the main propulsion all the
time so that plume impingement on the ship may be avoided
by proper vectoring of the. ship with respect to wind direc-
tion changes. Additionally, if the ship must assume a
course and speed to stay in the burn area and if that course
and speed result in undesirable plume conditions for safe
operation, then the incinerators shall be temporarily shut
down or revert to fuel oil until safe conditions can again
be-met.
13) The Vulcanus should demonstrate the ability to remain in
constant 24-hour communication with the Johnston Island USAF
On Scene Coordinator by voice and by code, using frequencies
and channel appropriate to the area and to the conditions
of transmission and reception. The requirement supplements
but is not intended to supersede nor replace the existing
