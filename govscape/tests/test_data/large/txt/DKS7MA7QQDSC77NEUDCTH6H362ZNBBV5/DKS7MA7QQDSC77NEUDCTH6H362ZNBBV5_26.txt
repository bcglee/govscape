operate worldwide. Two diesel engines drive a single propeller to give cruis-
ing speeds of 10 to 13 knots. Her crew numbers 18; twelve to operate the ves-
sel and six to operate the incinerators.
2.2 TANKS AND PUMPS
The Vulcanus is a double-hull, double-bottom vessel. Waste is carried in
o
15 cargo tanks-which range in size from 115 to 574 cubic meters (m ) with an
overall capacity of 3503 m . Figure 3 is a schematic of the cargo tank layout.
Tanks are filled through a manifold on deck using a dockside loading pump.
During normal operation the waste tanks can be discharged only through the
incinerator feed system. There is, however, provision for discharging the cargo
into the ocean if an emergency arises. Piping system construction makes it
possible for any tank to be connected to either incinerator and for cargo to be
transferred from one tank to another.
The space between the two hulls is used for ballast. Ballast tanks may be
filled with seawater and emptied independently as required to trim and balance
the ship. Fuel oil is carried in tanks under and in the engine room. The
engine room is separated from the cargo tanks by double bulkheads. The pump
room and generator room are situated between the engine room and the waste
tanks,
