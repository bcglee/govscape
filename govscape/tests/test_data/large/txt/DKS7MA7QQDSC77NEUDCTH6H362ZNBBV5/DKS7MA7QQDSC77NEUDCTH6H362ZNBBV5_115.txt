Several changes in the design of the on-line monitoring system used in the
Herbicide Orange tests would allow extended operation without excessive mainte-
nance, calibration, and tuning:
t Elimination of cold spots in the lines carrying combustion
effluent and siting of manifolds so that condensate which might
form cannot drain into instruments.
ยง Addition of condensate traps in lines carrying sample gas. The
volumes of these traps should be small so as to minimize instru-
ment response time to concentration changes in the sample gas.
t Substitution of a gas conditioner operating on a different prin-
ciple, such as refrigeration, for the diffusion-type gas con-
ditioner used thus far. Alternatively, appropriate absorption
systems for H?0 and HC1 might be found, and gas conditioners
could be eliminated.
The extensive test program discussed in this section has demonstrated the
feasibility of using on-line monitoring instruments to measure CCL and CO con-
centrations in incinerator effluent streams and to determine permit compliance.
The instrumentation package withstood hard travel and corrosive combustion
gases. The only problems occurred because of design oversights.
