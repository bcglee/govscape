4t*~ ' The report describes the at-sea incineration of three shiploads (approxi-
mately 10,400 metric tons) of U.S. Air Force-owned Herbicide Orange onboard the
incinerator ship M/T Vulcanus, within an EPA-designated Pacific Ocean burn zone,
west of Johnston Atoll. The first shipload, transported to the burn zone from the
U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Base, Gulfport, Mississippi, was incinerated
under EPA research permit. Shiploads 2 and 3 were taken onboard M/T Vulcanus
at Johnston Island and incinerated under EPA special permit. The incineration was
monitored, sampled, and analyzed to ensure compliance with EPA permit operating
and safety conditions related to at-sea operations. An EPA representative was
onboard M/T Vulcanus during the initial burn. A U.S. Air Force representative
participated in monitoring all three burns. Monitoring utilized on-line instrumen-
tation to measure CO and CO2, oxygen concentration, and total hydrocarbons from
both incinerators. These parameters served as a measure of overall combustion
efficiency with primary emphasis on the C02/CO ratio in the effluent gases. Com-
bustion efficiency exceeded 99.9% during all three burns. Destruction and combustion
efficiencies measured during all burns met or exceeded requirements. All other
conditions of the permits related to at-sea incineration operations were met.
