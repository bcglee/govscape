be much less than the "expected value" calculated from the volumes involved.
The USAF EHL(K) is in the process of studying the behavior of Orange herbicide
in aquatic systems especially sea water. In one study using artificial sea
water*, Orange herbicide was mixed into the water in an amount equal to 150 mg/1.
Had all components gone right into solution, by computation, ester concentrations
would have been 64 mg/1 (2,4-0 NBE) and 61 mg/1 (2,4,5-T NBE). The actual,
measured concentrations were 2'mg/1 (2,4-D NBE) and 1.8 mg/1 (2,4,5-T NBE)
immediately after mixing. These increased to 18 and 22 mg/1 of 2,4-D NBE and
2,4,5-T NBE, respectively, at 24 hours and then started a rapid decline to 7.5
and 9.5 mg/1 at 48 hours after mixing. The rate of disappearance of the ester
of 2,4-D was fairly rapid and was assumed to be mainly a result of hydrolysis.
The half-life of the ester was 15 hours. The addition of natural biota such as
bacteria, algae and fish would be expected to produce an even faster disappear-
ance of 2,4-0 NBE. Evidence that this occurs was observed in studies EHL(K) is
conducting with marine animals at the National Marine Fisheries Laboratory in
Port Aransas, Texas. In one of these studies, shrimp were exposed in five dif-
ferent concentrations of 2,4-D NBE and natural sea water. The average half-life
of the ester in the five concentrations was 5 hours. This was 1/3 of the half-
life observed in the situation where no biological systems existed.
(b) Circulation of Water in Relation to Availability of
Herbicide for Absorption; Some of the toxicity studies completed so far indi-
cate the complexity of trying to predict the ecological results of a planned
or accidental contamination of a body of water with phenoxy herbicides. At
EHL(K), Orange herbicide was mixed in a fish tank at a concentration that would
theoretically produce a 200 ppro / concentration if such a high concentration
v v
were possible. Most of the herbicide rapidly sank to the bottom of the tank
after mixing. Fathead minnows placed in the tank showed no ill effects during
two weeks of exposure. Yet in a toxicity study under the same conditions but
with continuous agitation of the water by aeration, all of the fish died in a
"20 ppm concentration" of Orange herbicide water in 24 hours. Subsequent
studies revealed that some circulation of the water was essential if a dose-
related response was to be established in toxicity studies with the N-butyl
