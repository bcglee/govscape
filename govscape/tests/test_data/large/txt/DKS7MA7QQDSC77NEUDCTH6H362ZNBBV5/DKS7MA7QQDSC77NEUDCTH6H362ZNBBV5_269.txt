Now, CO and hydrocarbons are trace quantitites, so

The HC£ content of the combustion effluent can be deduced from
the carbon-to-chlorine ratio in the herbicide because all but
trace quantities of C£ go to HCA and all but trace quantities
of C go to C0 product. Since

then, substituting into Equation (13)
a 100 - % 0 - (1 + CA/C) % C0 (14)

• Therefore, excess air, Y, is obtained from Equations (12)
and (14)
Y = % 0 /[0,264 (100 - % 0 - (1 + CA/C) % C0 )- % 0 ] (15)

or
Y = % 0 /[26.4 - 1,264% 0 - 0.264 (1 + Ci/C) % C0 ] (16)

Substituting into Equation (10) the expression for Y from
Equation (16) and the expression for S in Equation (1),
gives
