gas sampled was 6.0914 m . the emission concentration of 2,4-D plus 2,4,5-T
was
<1 ng/ul x 103 yl/ml x 2 ml x 2191 ml/248 ml x (1/6.0914 m3) x 10"3 yg/ng
* <3 yg/m •
A similar calculation was performed for the sorbent trap and probe rinse samples
of 7/16/77. The total 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T emission concentration in the sample of
3
7/16/77 was <7 yg/m . The calculated emission concentration of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T
o
at 0% destruction efficiency is (Table 45) 115 g/m . The destruction efficiency
for 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T was
(115 x 106 yg/m3 - <7 yg/m3)/175 x 106 yg/m3 = >0.99999993
11. DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCIES FOR 2,4-D AND 2,4,5-T FROM BCL ANALYSES
Neither 2,4*D nor 2,4,5-T was detected in the benzene impinger sample of
7/18/77 (Table 41). The impinger volume was 600 ml, and the volume of gas
sampled was 0.1235 m3 (Table 52). The detection limits for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T
were 0.08 yg/ml and 0.04 yg/ml, respectively, and were used to calculate the
maximum possible amounts in the sample:
<0.08 yg/ml x 600 ml x 1/0.1235 m3 = <390 yg/m3 2,5-D
<0.04 y/ml x 600 ml x 1/0.1235 m3 « <190 yg/m3 2,4,5-T
Similar calculations were made for the probe and line rinses. The sample
set of 7/IB/77 was found to contain:
<590 yg/m3 of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T.
The emission concentration at 0% destruction efficiency for 2,4-D +
2,4,5-T on 7/18/77 was 120 g/m3 (Table 49). The destruction efficiency for
2,4-D + 2,4,5-T was,
(120 g/m3 - <590 yg/m3)/120 g/m3 = >0.99999
12. CONVERSION OF CONCENTRATIONS
Emission concentrations in this report are given exclusively in terms of
weight per unit volume, e.g., mg/m . This form of presentation was used rather
than, e.g., ppm, (1) for ease of comparison of measured levels of 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T with the 8 hour TLV of 10 mg/m and (2) because it is necessary to know
