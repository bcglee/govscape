5.3.3 Potable Water Samples
Table 42 presents results of analyses of three samples of the drinking
water used during the three burns. No herbicide could be detected at a detec-
tion limit of less than 0.1 ppb.
5.4 PLUME CHARACTERISTICS AND CONTROL
The Safety-Plan (Appendix A) defined a responsibility for maintaining a
speed and heading,of the M/T Vulcanus so as to prevent contact of the plume
with the ship.
Experience during the burning of organochlorine wastes by the M/T Vulcanus
in the Gulf of Mexico and during the Herbicide Orange burns off Johnston Island
showed that certain relative wind conditions and ship headings affected the
direction and behavior of the plume and were effective in keeping it off the
ship.
Visual location of the plume during the herbicide incineration was diffi-
cult because it was generally transparent and could only be seen close to the
furnaces as a convection disturbance in the atmosphere. However, the plume was
made visible as desired by the addition of. ML gas at the: stack level. HC1 mea-

A Drager apparatus'.• consisting of an aspirating bellows and a standard color
developing tube was used to identify and locate the plume by its HC1 content.
A series of experiments was performed in order to study and measure the
effect of wind speed, wind direction, ship heading, and propeller rpm on the
plume. The,results are summarized in Table 48. They appear to be a useful
basis for plume control during at-sea incinerations.
In these experiments the ship was positioned in a particular attitude
(heading) to the wind, the wind speed measured with an anemometer, and tests
made for HC1 on the downwind part of the ship. HC1 was used as a convenient
tracer for the plume.
When HC1 was noted on the ship, even at the detection limit of 0.1 ppm,
the contemporary conditions of ship heading, wind speed, and propeller rpm were
considered unacceptable. The following observations were made:
• Drifting with the wind at 90 degrees directly abeam showed no
HC1 and thus no plume impingement onboard at wind speeds up
to and including 10 m/s (20 knots). Incineration under these
conditions may, therefore, be permitted.
