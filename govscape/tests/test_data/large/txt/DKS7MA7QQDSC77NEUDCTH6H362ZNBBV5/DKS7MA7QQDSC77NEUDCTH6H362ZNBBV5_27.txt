2.3 INCINERATOR SYSTEM
Waste is burned 1n two Identical refractory-lined furnaces located at the
stem. Each incinerator consists of two main sections, a combustion chamber
and a stack, through which the combusting gases pass sequentially (Figure 4).
This dual chamber configuration, which is characteristic of most high intensity
combustion systems, uses the first chamber for internal mixing and the second
for adequate residence time. Table 3 gives characteristics of the incinerators.
Combustion air is supplied by large fixed speed blowers with a rated maxi-
mum capacity of 90,000 cubic meters per hour for each incinerator. Adjustable
vanes are incorporated in the combustion air supply system. When they are
deflected, system pressure drop is increased, and the flow rate is reduced.
Although no instrumentation is installed to monitor air flow rate, normal
