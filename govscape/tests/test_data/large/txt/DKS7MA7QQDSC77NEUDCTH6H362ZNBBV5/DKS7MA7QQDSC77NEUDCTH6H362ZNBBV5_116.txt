5. SAFETY AND PERSONNEL PROTECTION
- -• ' - • \
This section describes the procedures which were used to protect personnel
from exposure to Herbicide Orange and TCDD or their combustion products during
the at-sea incineration of the herbicide onboard the M/T Vulcanus. The person-
nel protection plan was incorporated into the Safety Plan (Appendix A) and thus
became part of the permit conditions for the incineration.
Herbicide Orange is an organic chloride consisting of a 50/50 mixture
(approximately) of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. When drummed, this material contained
TCDD as a toxic but minor constituent at levels of 0.5 to 47.0 ppm with an
(2)
average concentration of 1.9 ppm. '
Herbicide Orange (i.e., 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T) has been shown to be moderately
toxic and is rapidly eliminated from the body by the kidneys. The American
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (AC6IH) has recommended Thresh-
old Limit Values (TLVs) in air for either 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T to be 10 mg/m3. The
TLV:is a time-weighted safe air concentration for an 8-hour day or 40-hour work
wee.k. Based on the TLV, a range of time-limited ambient (personnel breathing
zorie) concentrations considered safe exposure levels for personnel onboard the
M/T Vulcanus were set (Appendix A) as follows:
Combined'Concentration of Butyl Esters of 2.4-D and 2,4,5-T
3
2.0 mg/m for samples taken periodically over 16 hours or
3
10.0 mg/m for samples taken periodically over 8 hours
TCDD has been shown to be extremely toxic, with no-effect dose levels for
embryotoxicity and chick edema as low as 0.03 to 0.1 yg/kg/of body weight/day,
respectively. The safe ambient concentration for TCDD onboard the M/T Vulcanus
was established as 6 ng/m (Appendix A). Furthermore, TCDD in its physiological
action is embryotoxic, teratogenic (especially in the first trimester) and
acnegenic. It is this extremely high toxicity, with the possibility of organic
damage and the disfiguring effects of chloracne, which dictated the type of
