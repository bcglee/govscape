Reagents •
• Methylene Chloride - Spectrophotometric grade
t KBr powder - spectrograde
Procedure
It is possible that two sample forms will occur: (1) an amorphous mass
(expected to be the typical sample) and (2) a crystalline or powdery mass.
Separate procedures are desirable for these two forms in order to obtain the
best available spectra.
Procedure for Amorphou s .Materia1
Add a few drops of methylene chloride to solubilize the sample slightly
and mix with the tip of a disposable Pasteur pipette. Then using the pipette,
take a few drops of this material and transfer to a clean KBr salt plate.
Allow the solvent to evaporate at ambient temperature, and then press the other
salt plate to spread the sample throughout the area where the IR beam impinges
on the plate, Mount the sample cell in the sample compartment of the spectro-
photometer previously prepared according to the manufacturer's manual and check
for resolution (see Note on Resolution). Scan the region from 2.5 to 15 microns
using the parameters in Table C-2. The sample size should be adjusted so that
the most intense peak in the spectrum has a percent transmission of between
5 to 15 percent. If the spectrum is too weak, more sample must be added, the
solvent evaporated, the plates re-assembled, and the spectrum rerun as above.
If the spectrum is too strong, i.e., peaks with less than 5 percent, excess
sample must be removed by wiping the plates and rerun as above.
