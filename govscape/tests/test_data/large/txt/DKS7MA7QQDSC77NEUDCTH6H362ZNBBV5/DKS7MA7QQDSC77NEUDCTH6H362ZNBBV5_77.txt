The sorbent traps contain XAD-2, a porous polymer sorbent. The resin from
each trap was extracted in a soxhlet extractor with pentane for 24 hours. The
extract was then made to constant volume. Weighed portions of the burner resi-
dues were treated in the same manner. The probe and heat-traced line rinse
samples were acetone solutions which also contained aqueous HC1, dissolved
stainless steel, and firebrick particulates shed by the incinerator linings.
Because of the large amount of such particulate material, the second and third
(fi)
burn probe and heat traced line rinses were filtered first through Whatman 41
filters and then through 47 micrometer cutoff Mi Hi pore filters. The volumes
of the probe and heat-traced line rinses were measured at Johnston Island after
each burn before shipment. The volumes were also measured prior to starting
the analyses.
Two-mi aliquots of the sorbent trap and burner residue extracts were set
aside for the C7rC16 GC analysis. The remainder of the extracts were concen-
trated to 2 ml. Similarly, 250-ml portions of the probe and heat-traced line
rinses were taken for analysis. A 2-ml aliquot of each was set aside for the
C7-C16 GC analysis, and the remaining 248-ml portions were concentrated to 2 ml.
4.2.2.2 Analytical Techniques
Brief descriptions of the analytical techniques used are given below:
• Gravimetry/Infrared Spectroscopy (Gray/IR): A 0.5-ml aliquot
of each concentrate was evaporated to constant weight, and the
nonvolatile residue weight was measured. This weight provided
an estimate of the content of nonvolatile organic compounds in
a sample. An infrared spectrum was measured on a portion of
each residue to give qualitative information on classes of com-
pounds present in the sample.
• Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA): Despite having been filtered,
the residues from the probe and heat-traced line rinses were
higher than usually observed. It was suspected that the resi-
dues might have significant inorganic contents. Therefore,
thermogravimetric analyses were performed. Basically, the anal-
ysis involves heating the sample at a uniform rate and recording
weight loss as a function of temperature. The sample,.is con-
tained in a small pan suspended from a microbalance. The fur-
nace atmosphere was nitrogen, so that only organic carbon was
volatilized.
