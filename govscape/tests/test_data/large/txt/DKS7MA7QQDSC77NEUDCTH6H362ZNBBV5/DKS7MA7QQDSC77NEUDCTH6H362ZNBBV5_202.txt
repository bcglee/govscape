3. CONCENTRATION OF ORGANIC SAMPLES
Scope and Application
The purpose of this procedure is to concentrate samples for Level 1 and
Level 2 organic analyses, These samples will be in the form of solvent
extracts of solid field samples and of solvent rinses of sampling hardware.
During concentration volatile organic species may be lost, and thus these com-
pounds must be determined in the aliquot samples of the neat extracts and
rinses taken before concentration. The concentrations will be performed with
Kuderna-Danish evaporators. Various sizes of evaporators may be used depend-
ing upon the size of the sample to be concentrated. Thus, before this proce-
dure is begun, there is a decision point to select the appropriate size of
Kuderna-Danish evaporator to be used. The extracts are dried with anhydrous
sodium sulfate before concentration.
Summary of Method
The solvent extract or rinse sample is transferred to a Kuderna-Danish
evaporator. The evaporator apparatus is heated on a steam bath to drive off
the, solvent. When the sample is sufficiently concentrated, the evaporator is
removed from the steam bath and allowed to cool. The sample is then trans-
ferred to a volumetric flask.

K-D - Kuderna-Danish evaporator
MeOH - Methanol
Sample Handling
All equipment (i.e., sample containers, flasks, etc.) that contacts either
the solvent extracts and rinses or the concentrates is to be glass, Teflon, or
stainless steel. No grease or lubricant of any kind is to be used on the
ground glass joints of the concentration apparatus.
All glassware is to be rinsed with the same high-purity solvent with
which the sample was extracted (i.e,Â» Pentane),
