Preparation of the 6C/MS Instrument
The gas chromatograph shall be prepared according to the manufacturer's
Operating manual. Key operating parameters to be used are as follows:
Column - 3% OV-101 on 100-120 mesh Chromo-
sorb WHP, 6-ft x 2-mm ID,
glass 100-120
Carrier Gas - Helium, zero grade at 20 ml/min
Oven Temperature - 50-280°C programmed at 4°C/min
Injector Temperature <• TBD
Transfer Lines and Separator - 200° - 220°C
The mass spectrometer (MS) will be prepared according to the manufac-
turer's operating manual. Briefly summarized, this procedure includes:
t Monitoring all applicable pressures and confirming that proper
vacuum levels are being achieved. Proper levels are specified
in the manual.
• Checking all applicable temperatures and making adjustments as
necessary: . '
Ionizer - TBD
Main chamber - TBD
Electron multiplier - TBD
• Checking performance of ionizer.
• Optimizing resolution/sensitivity.
• Confirming that all electronics associated with data gathering
are functioning properly.
Important MS parameters to be set are as follows:
Electron energy 70 eV
Ionizing energy 1 milliamp, may be changed to 0.2 mA
Electron multiplier 2.5 kV, or as required to optimize
signal-to-noise ratio
-5
Sensitivity 10 amps/volt
Source pressure 5 x 10 torr or less
