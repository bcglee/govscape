The data to be obtained are:
• Weight of sample added to column,
• Weights of fractions after they have been evaporated in
aluminum dishes to constant weight.
Data are indicated on the data sheet.
Sample Preparation -
1. Obtain volume of sample extract calculated to give either the
optimum weight, 100 mg or a weight not less than 50 mg.
2. Obtain a precleaned and labeled beaker of at least 30% greater
capacity than the required volume of sample. Pipette the sam-
ple into the beaker, cover loosely with a watch glass, set in
hood and allow solvent to come to near dryness.
3. Quantitatively transfer the near-dry sample into a clean,
tared, and labeled glass weighing boat. Rinse the beaker with
methylene chloride into boat.
4. Check the weight of the boat twice daily until the weight
is stable. This is the sample weight.
5. Add 0.5-1.0 g of freshly activated silica gel to the weigh-
ing boat and mix thoroughly with a sample using a microspatula.
Activation of Silica Gel
Activate the silica gel for 2 hours in a drying oven at 110°C. Cool and
store in a desiccator.
Column Packing
1. Plug the outlet of the precleaned column with glass wool. Pack
the column with 6.5 grams of freshly activated silica gel. For
freshly activated silica gel, this weight occupies 9 ml in a
10 ml graduated cylinder. Tap the column briefly with the
microspatula to compact the bed.
2. Take a 50 ml volume of pentane and pour it through the column
until the bed is homogeneous, free of any cracks, and free of
any air bubbles. Continue pentane flow until the 50 ml volume
is used. The pentane level should be at the top of the bed,
hereafter called the origin. NEVER ALLOW THE TOP OF THE BED
TO GO DRY. w
