C7-C16 Gas Ghromatography : This analysis gives an estimate of
the. volatile organic content of a sample: compounds boiling
between 90° and 300°C. The compounds in a neat sample or uncon-
centrated sample extract are separated in order of increasing
boiling points. Compounds in various ranges, defined in cali-
bration with the n-C7 through n-C16 alkanes, are quantitated
as n-decane.
Liquid Chromatographic Separation (L.C): If an extract contains
sufficient organic material that an emission concentration is
calculated to exceed 0.5 mg/m^ (or 0.1 mg/kg), then a portion
of the extract is separated into eight fractions by liquid chro-
matography. This separation has the effect of simplifying the
sample because each fraction will contain -certain classes of
compounds. Each fraction is evaporated to dryness. The residue
weight is measured. An infrared spectrum is measured on each
residue having sufficient weight.
Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS): In this tech-
nique, compounds in a concentrate are separated by gas chroma-
tography and detected by a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrum
of a compound is unique. In practice, the spectra of closely
related positional isomers and optical isomers are not distin-
guishable. GC/MS is not particularly quantitative unless stand-
ards of each sought-for compound are also available and analyzed.
: In the analysis of the herbicide samples, quantitative measure-
ments were made for 2, 4-D and 2,4, 5-T. Estimates of concentrations
of other identified compounds were also made.
4.2.3 TRW Analytical Results
4-2.3.1 Waste Feed Analyses
Four composite feed samples, taken at Burner No. 4, were analyzed. One
was a sample of the diesel fuel used to heat the incinerators and was taken as
part of the background test. Two were Herbicide Orange. The fourth sample
was of herbicide-contaminated water that was flashed during the third burn.
The waste feed samples were analyzed by the following procedures:
• ..GC analysis for C6-C17 hydrocarbons
• GC/MS for qualitative analysis
The results of the C7-C16 GC analysis are given in Table 22. It can be
seen that the diesel fuel feed had a substantial content of compounds boiling
below 300°C. The two herbicide feeds have only small amounts of compounds
boiling below 300°C. The fourth feed sample had no detectable amounts of
organic compounds boiling below 300°C. (Both 2, 4-D and 2»4,5-T, which comprise
more than 90% of Herbicide Orange, have boiling points well above 300°C.)
