solvent(s) rests with the operator and his knowledge of the sample (e.g., which
LC fraction, IR data, solubilities, etc.);
• Pentane
• Methylene chloride
• Methanol
• Petroleum ether _
• D1ethyl ether
Procedure
Instrument Preparation
The procedure assumes that the MS has been activated per the manufacturer's
manual and is prepared to gather and record data. Briefly summarized this pro-
cedure includes:
• Monitoring all applicable pressures and confirming that proper
vacuum levels are being achieved.
• Checking all applicable temperatures and making adjustments
as necessary.,
« Checking performance of ionizer.
• Optimizing resolution/sensitivity.
• Confirming that all electronics associated with data gathering
are functioning properly.
When all the' necessary checks have been performed, then proceed with the anal-
ysis of a sample.
Analysis of the Sample^
1. Place 1 microgram or less of the sample under test in a solid
probe glass capillary. The sample may be inserted as a solid
but it is preferable to first dissolve it in a solvent. Both
techniques, described in steps (a) and (b) below, ensure con-
trolled evaporation of the sample into the ion source. Avoid
touching or otherwise contaminating the solid probe tip or the
glass capillary. Always wear clean nylon gloves or equivalent
when handling the solid probe tip, and use forceps to handle
the glass capillaries.
a. If the sample is in solution, the solvent must be evapo-
rated prior to inserting the sample into the mass spec-
trometer. Do this by gently heating the glass capillary.
