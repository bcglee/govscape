since they respond to 2,4-D air pollution when other plants showed no evidence
of injury. Injury to grapevines may result from exposure to levels in the ppb
range. Other workers report tomato plant damage in the ppt range. Walsh (1972)
reports a 50% reduction in growth of unicellur marine algae exposed to phenoxy
herbicide concentrations of 50 to 300 ppm. Other relative sensitivities are
indicated in Table B-6.
5. TOXICOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TCDD: The word teratology has rather
recently become quite familiar to biologists, chemists and certain other per-
sons working in various scientific disciplines. It was applied to 2,4,5-T when
studies by Bionetics Research Laboratory, Division of Litton Industries,
Bethseda MD in 1969-70 implied that 2,4,5-T was teratogenic in mice and rats
(Courtney et al_., 1970). Subsequently, studies revealed that a toxic contami-
nant was responsible for the findings originally attributed to 2,4,5-T. The
sample of 2,4,5-T employed in the Bionetics study contained 27 Â±8 ppm TCDD.
Some studies have shown that oral administration of 2,4,5-T containing <1 ppm
TCDD produces no teratogenic effects on rats, rabbits, mice and other species.
a. Toxi c i ty to Animals: TCDD was found to be the most toxic chloro-
dibenzo-p-dioxin studied. It was found to have LDgnS in the yg/kg range for
several species of animals and was acnegenic, highly embryotoxic and positive
for the chick edema factor. "The no-effect dose levels for embryotoxicity and
chick edema were 0.03 to 0.1 yg/kg/day respectively" (Schwetz et_ a_l_., 1973).
(1) Acute Toxicity: Studies performed on TCDD by the Biochemical
Research Laboratory, Dow Chemical Co., can be summarized as follows with the
data presented as the LDgg in yg/kg of body weight for several species: rats
20-40; mice, males >64, females 130; guinea pig 0.6-2.0; rabbits =30; dogs >30
(Rowe et.iL> n.d.). The signs of intoxication are characterized by a chronic
illness and liver damage. Half of the deaths occur more than two weeks after
treatment while some animals died after 48 hours. Excretion is primarily by
way of feces and is very slow. The highest concentrations are found in the
liver and fat with a smaller amount being found in the testes. The LD for
5Q
the rabbit is about the same whether administered intraperitoneally or applied
to the skin. In the eye it does not cause cornea! injury but does produce
thickening of the lids. It does cause severe chloracne when applied to the
ears of rabbits in yg quantities.
