maximum and minimum levels measured for all data points. The mean value Is a
numerical average of all data points. Sample calculations for HC1 concentra-
tion, combustion efficiency, and excess air are given 1n Appendix F.2.
Table 16 1s a summary of the on-line data for all three burns. These
data show the relative uniformity of the burning operation as evidenced by the
low standard deviation 1n the stack concentrations of CO, (X, and total
hydrocarbons. Based on the data obtained during Incineration onboard the M/T
Vulcanus, the combustion efficiency was 99.97% or greater during all monitoring
periods. Excess air ranged from 45 to 101%, and the average oxygen concentra-
tion ranged from 5.4 to 12.8% for all Herbicide Orange burn data. For the fuel
oil background tests, excess air varied from 80 to 144%.
On-line gas composition data were taken during a traverse of the sampling
probe across the starboard incinerator stack. Data acquired at 1 -minute inter-
vals while the probe was stationary at each location are presented in Figure 15.
Results indicate that Incinerator combustion efficiency can be measured accu-
rately with a fixed probe at any position greater than 10 cm into the furnace.
All CO/CO, measurements beyond this point yielded calculated efficiencies of
99.991 +0.002%.
