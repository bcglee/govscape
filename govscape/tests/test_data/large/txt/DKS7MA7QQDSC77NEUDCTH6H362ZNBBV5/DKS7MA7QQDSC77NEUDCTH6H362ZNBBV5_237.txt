addition, thermochemical analysis also predicts that HC1 formation is highly
favored at Herbicide Orange incineration temperatures (1000°C to 1500°C range),
and that Clp, Cl, CIO and HOC! are found in only trace quantities. The HC1
concentrations to be expected from the incineration of Herbicide Orange are in
the 1.6 to 2.4 mole percent range.
It may be noted from Table 0-2 that the equilibrium CO concentration can
be as high as 2800 ppm at 1841°C when the oxygen concentration is 2.8 mole per-
cent. The high equilibrium CO concentration under excess air conditions results
from the equilibration of COg according to the water gas shift reaction:
C0 + HW,",',?? CO + H,0
c0. i L
Since the water gas shift reaction is known to be a relatively slow reaction,
the C02 equilibration process may not be complete in the incinerator environ-
ment, and the actual CO concentration at high incineration temperatures may be
considerably lower than the equilibrium CO concentration. It may also be noted
from. Table 0-2 that at air/Herbicide Orange, feed ratios between 7.88 and 10,56,
and incineration temperatures between 1000°C and 1500°C (the recommended oper-
ating region for the destruction of Herbicide Orange, as will be discussed,in
Section 0-2), the maximum equilibrium CO concentration is 72 ppm. At 99.9%
combustion efficiency, the allowable CO concentration is 118 ppm (since the
COg concentration is .11.8 mole %). Thus the stipulation of a 99.9% combustion
efficiency is not limited by equilibrium CO concentrations in the recommended
operating region for the destruction of Herbicide Orange.

The adiabatic flame temperature is the highest attainable flame temperature
when Herbicide Orange is burned in air without loss of heat. The actual flame
temperature, depending on the construction of the burner and combustion chamber
and heat losses, would be of the order of a hundred degrees lower than the adi-
abatic flame temperature. For Herbicide Orange, the adiabatic flame tempera-
tures were calculated at four air/waste ratios by using the TRW Chemical Analy-
sis Program, a heat of formation of -152,000 cal/g mole for the normal butyl
ester of 2 4-D, and a heat of formation of -159,000 cal/g mole for the normal
