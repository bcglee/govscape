(2) Toxic Effects on the fetus
U) Hamsters; Commercial samples of 2,4,5-T were shown by
Collins and Williams (1971) to be feticidal and teratogenic in the golden Syrian
hamster. Dose levels of 2,4,5-T ranged from 20 to 100 mg/kg/day while TCDD
content varied from 0,1 to 45 ppm. Doses of 100 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T approach
levels causing maternal mortality,
Rats: TCDD is highly embryotoxic in the rat. No effect
was seen at a dose level of 0.03 ug/kg/day but at the 0.125 yg/kg/day dose
level there was a significant incidence of fetuses with intestinal hemorrhage;
fetal deaths and resorptions increased. Delayed skeletal maturation was seen.
At 2 Mg/kg/day there were few viable fetuses and the survivors had a high inci-
dence of anomalies. At 8 yg/kg/day there was severe maternal toxicity and
there were no viable fetuses. King et aJL (1971) studied the effect of 2,4,5-T
and 2,4-D administered by gavage and an intrauterine technique using Sprague-
Dawley rats as the test species, "Purified" and "technical" grade 2,4,5-T were

applied to Mi Hi pore filters that were then placed on the amniotic sac of the
embryo. "Purified" 2,4,5-T intrauterinely applied to 93 embryos on any one day
of gestation from day 12 to 16 at a dose range of 50 to 120 yg per embryo
resulted in no cleft palates. Substituting the technical for purified grade
and using the same technique on 118 embryos resulted in two cleft palates.
Oral administration of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T at a total dose range of 60 to 1.20 mg/kg
to 245 rats, yielded 2,231 fetuses, nine of which had cleft palates. Again,
these are high dose levels.
b. Industrial Exposure; Dow Chemical Co. prepared an extensive health
inventory of 126 manufacturing personnel in an effort to identify harmful
effects of inhaled 2,4,5-T. The inhalation rate of the agent was estimated to
be from 1.6 to 8.1 mg/day/ worker, depending on work assignment, for periods of
up to three years. The survey indicates that no illness was associated with
2,4,5-T intake. In plants where 2,4,5-T contained a high proportion of TCDD,
Bleiberg et_ aj_. (1964) found 18% of the exposed employees suffered from moderate
to severe chloracne, the intensity of which correlated significantly with the
presence of hyperpigmentation, hirsutism and eye irritation. In the late 1940's
a pressure overload resulted in the accidental rupture of a vessel containing
the sodium salt of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol , a precursor of 2,4,5-T. During the
