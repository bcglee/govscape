Placing the capillary under a heat latnp or appliance such
as a hair dryer is acceptable,
b. If the sample is inserted as a solid, it may occasionally
blow out of the capillary when heated too quickly. To
prevent this, place the solid at the bottom of the glass
capillary and then insert a small quantity of silanized
glass wool (pyrex) over the sample.
CAUTION: Sample size should be 1 yg or less to minimize
contamination of the ion source.
2. Place the capillary tube into the end of the solid probe by
pushing the retaining spring aside then releasing it to hold
the capillary tube in place.
3. Insert the solid probe tip into the slip vacuum seal at the
entrance of the solid inlet, and push the solid probe in
until the index pin in the guide rod snaps into the hold in
'\, the tube.
4. 'Tighten the-slip vacuum seal by turning the black knob
clockwise.
5. Evacuate the inlet solid and monitor the inlet pressure, and
when it is reduced to 0.04 torr stop the evacuation.
6. "Open the solid probe valve by rotating the crank
counterclockwise.
7. Depress the locking button on the guide rod, and slowly push
in the solid probe to the full length of travel.
8. Connect one end of the solid probe heating cable to the
socket in the handle of the probe. Connect the other end of
the cable to the connector labeled Program.
9. Prepare the mass spectrometer for acquiring data. The param-
eters which must be entered into the MS controller include
the following:
Solid probe temperature - Program rate
Mass range - 40-600
Scan time for mass range -
Time interval between scanning -
Record this data in the instrument log book.
