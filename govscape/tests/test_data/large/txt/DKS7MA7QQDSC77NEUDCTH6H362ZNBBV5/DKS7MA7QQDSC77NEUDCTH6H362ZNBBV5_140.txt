7. ERROR PROPAGATION ANALYSIS OF DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCY CALCULATIONS
This section briefly summarizes a detailed error propagation analysis,
presented in Appendix G of destruction efficiency calculations used in this
9
report. The error analysis shows that destruction efficiencies are determined
by the following variables: oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in
the combustion effluent; composition of the waste feed; and emission concen-
trations of waste constituents determined by laboratory analyses of combustion
effluent samples. Appendix G also shows that as long as there is excess air,
minor variations in combustion air and waste feed rates do not affect destruc-
tion efficiency because it is a dimensionless ratio. Variances in destruction
efficiencies for 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T and TCDD were calculated from the variances
in the factors listed above. Average values and standard deviations of the
variables; are presented in Table 56.
Results of the error propagation analysis in Appendix G are summarized as

• For 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T
1) The mean, EF, and standard deviation, s(DE), in destruction
efficiency for 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T are:
BE" 99.999971%
s(DE) = 4.5 x 10"5%
2) A conservative statistical analysis shows that there is 95%
confidence that not more than 1 measured destruction effi-
ciency in 1000 would be less than 99.99935%.
