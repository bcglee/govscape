• I;t,,ts assumed that calculations of destruction efficiency for
TCDD are normally distributed. The questions asked is what
percentage of a group of dioxin destruction efficiency cal-
culations will be less than some specified value and what
degree of confidence is there in that estimate of the
percentage.
v
There are four values for emission rates of TCDD given in
Table 50. Safety considerations dictate consideration of '*"
destruction efficiencies less than some specified value, ^
This value is defined by the one-sided tolerance limit. /,\ 7,
The value for the one-sided tolerance factor was selected^ '
for the population of four analyses such that there would be
95% confidence that not more than 0.1% of TCDD destruction
efficiencies would be less than the tolerance limit. In
other words, the tolerance limit is such that there is 95%
confidence that only one TCDD destruction efficiency in 1000
would be smaller in value.
K = 9.21, one-sided tolerance factor for n = 4
at 95% confidence
The tolerance limit is
DE/100 - sK = 0.99948 - 9,21 x 4,409 x 10"4
= 0.9954
• Therefore, this conservative statistical analysis shows that
.there is 95% confidence that not more than 1 measured destruc-
tion efficiency for TCDD in 1000 would be less than 99.54%.
