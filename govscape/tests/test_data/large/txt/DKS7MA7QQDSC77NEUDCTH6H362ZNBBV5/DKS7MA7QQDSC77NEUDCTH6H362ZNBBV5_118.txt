those areas where personnel were concentrated. This concept appeared to have
the greatest possibility of success with the least interference with working
personnel. The objective was to isolate Herbicide Orange within set boundaries,
control access to those areas, and to eliminate carrying of the waste across
the boundaries by ship or test personnel. The ship was, therefore, divided
into clean and contaminated areas with boundaries separating them.
• Three areas of the ship were considered to be probable sources
of contamination:
1} The main deck (forward) which covered the waste storage
tanks. Filling ports and access hatches (Butterworths)
protrude through this deck from the tanks.
2) The pump room, located below decks, aft of the waste storage
area and below the 1iving quarters.
3) The combustion room, which houses the lower portions of the
two furnaces, the burners, and the combustion control area.
• One area was designated as free of contamination. This area
contained:
, ; ;:/r 1) -The bridge, with ship control and radio communication.
; ;
; ' ;: 2) Living quarters for officers, crew, and test team.
•;vv\H;' Y 3) Th6galley and combined mess hall /recreation room.
In addition to defining the boundary-isolation method for controlling per-
sonnel movement, the personnel protection plan also defined criteria for inter-
rupting the incineration to prevent exposure to Herbicide Orange. These cri-
teria are discussed in Appendix A. In brief, the personnel protection plan
provided for interruption of incinerator operations if:
• Conditions prevented keeping the plume off the ship
t Major spills occurred which could not readily be contained or
cleaned
• Combustion efficiency fell below 99.9%
§ Concentrations of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T in the combustion effluent
exceeded 130 ppm (130 yg/m3) as determined by onboard analysis
• Workspace air concentrations of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T exceeded the
TLV of 10 ppm over 8 hours or 2 ppm over 16 hours as determined
by onboard analysis
