and heat-traced line rinses were significantly inorganic. For example, the
70% weight loss from HQ-4-LR-716 indicates that the residue was 30% inorganic.
Correcting the residue weights for inorganic content gives a better estimation
of emissions of organic compounds with boiling points above 300°C.
Table 25 presents the results of the gravimetric analyses of the Lear-
Siegler train samples, corrected for solvent blanks and inorganic contents.
These corrected-weights, corresponding to hydrocarbons with boiling points .
greater than 300°C, are used in conjunction with infrared spectral analysis to
give information about emissionsof the classes of nonvolatile hydrocarbons
emitted during the incineration.
Each residue was also analyzed by infrared spectrophotometry. Qualitative
interpretations of the IR spectra in terms of classes of compounds found in the
residues are given in Table 26. Phthalate esters and/or silicones were found in
most of the residues. These are ubiquitous compounds and are frequently found
as contaminants in trace organic analyses. Precautions were taken in both the
sampling and analysis operations in this program, but it seems that contamina-
tion occurred and in a random fashion. Because the phthalate esters and sili-
cones are present in unknown quantities, no assessment as to emissions of non-
volatile hydrocarbons can be made. The presence of substituted benzene
compounds and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon in most of the samples is note-
worthy. Analyses to be discussed later will show that these compounds are not
waste components, but rather, are probably synthesized in the flame.
