4.2.5 Wright State University Analytical Results
Because of its extensive experience.in the analysis of TCDD in Herbicide
Orange and related environmental samples, the Brehm Laboratory of Wright State
University,was selected by the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Air Force.to perform anal-
yses of combustion effluent samples for the purpose of determining permit com-
pliance with respect to emissions of TCDD.
Table 38 presents results of the WSU analyses of the combustion effluent
samples for TCDD. It is seen that TCDD was detected in only the line and probe
rinse samples of 8 August (HO-2-LR-808^4 and HO-2-PR-808-H, respectively).
Comparison of the minimum detectable concentrations shows that they vary widely.
For example, TCDD was not detected.in any of the benzene impinger samples, yet
the minimum detectable concentrations ranged from <0.00094 ng/ml (HO-1-BI-716-M)
to <0.047 ng/ml (HO-2-BI-813-H). This variation was a consequence of the com-
plexity of the samples. There was (Section 4.2.3) a large number of organic
compounds in the samples. Many of these compounds were similar to TCDD in
molecular weight; consequently, the state-of-the-art methodology being employed
was not capable of completely separating TCDD from these extraneous compounds.
These compounds thus acted as interferences in the determination of TCDD and
