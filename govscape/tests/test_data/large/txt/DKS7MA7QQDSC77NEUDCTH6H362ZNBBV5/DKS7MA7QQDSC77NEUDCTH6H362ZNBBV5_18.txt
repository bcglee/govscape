13. Permittees shall have installed and in operating condition a
radio or other communications devices which are capable of
voice' transmission to the mainland from the Vulcanus when in
route to the incineration site and during the incineration of
the waste in the designated site. The frequency of reporting
and information to be transmitted is set forth in the Herbicide
Orange Contingency Plan contained in Appendix 9 of the hearing
record of April 7, 1977.
14. During the burns the Permittees shall transmit the following
information to EPA Headquarters every 24 hours:
a. Operating temperatures
b. Average combustion efficiency
c. Significant malfunctions/incidents
15. The Permittees shall monitor for carbon monoxide, carbon diox-
ide, oxygen, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, TCDD and other parameters in
accordance with the monitoring plan contained in Appendix B
(of the permit).
16. The Permittees shall comply with all provisions of the com-
prehensive safety plan set forth in Appendix C (of the permit).
' ; During incineration of the first shipload, a U.S. EPA Representative was
onboard to determine compliance with permit conditions. During incineration
of the second and third shiploads, the leader of the TRW sampling team was
designated U.S. EPA Advisor relative to permit compliance.
The U.S. Air Force issued a contract (No. F41608-77-C-0169) to the Brehm
Laboratory of Wright State University (WSU) to perform analyses for the toxic
contaminant (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) in the combustion efflu-
ent samples taken onboard the ship during incineration. The analyses by Wright
State were intended to determine compliance with the permit requirement that
emissions of TCDD not exceed 0.1% of the total TCDD in the waste. In other
words, the destruction efficiency of TCDD was required to be not less than
99,9%.
The U.S. Air Force issued a contract (No. F08635-76-D-0168) to Battelle-
Columbus Laboratories (BCL) to perform land based environmental monitoring
(air, land, and water) during the dedrumming and loading operations at Johnston
Atoll. BCL also analyzed combustion effluent, potable water, and workspace
air monitor samples from the ship for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
