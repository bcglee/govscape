This analysis is semi quantitative and semi qualitative. Calibrations are
replicated, but analyses are not. Thus, the results are semiquantitative. The
identity of peaks is not established; peaks are identified with the appropriate
n-alkane.
Application
This procedure applies solely to the Level 1 C7-C16 gas chromatographic
analysis of extracts or neat organic liquids. This procedure applies when the
analyst has received a sample.
Range
This procedure will provide for detection of components as n-alkanes in
concentrations down to 1 ng/yl with 1 yl injections.
Sensitivity
The sensitivity is defined as the shape of a plot of response (uV • sec)
versus amount injected (ng/yl) and has units of yV • sec • yl/ng. The sensi-
tivity of the procedure is 77-78 pV • sec • yl/ng for the n-alkanes heptane to
hexadecane,
Detection limit
The detection limit of this procedure as written is 0.7 ng/yl for a lyl
injection of n-decane. This limit is arbitrarily based on defining the minimum
detectable as 100 yV • sec. This is an easier operational definition than
defining the minimum detection limit to be that amount of material which yields
a signal twice the noise level.
It should be noted that the instrument is capable of perhaps one hundred*
fold greater sensitivity. The level specified here is sufficient for Level 1
analysis.
Interferences
There are no interferences.
Limitations
Reporting Limitations - It should be noted that a typical environmental
sample will contain compounds which: (a) will not elute 1n the specified boil-
ing ranges and thus will not be reported and/or (b) will not elute from the
1920
