a) XAD-2 resin; weigh directly into thimble.
b) Burner residue; weigh onto pre-extractad Whatman filter
discs! fold into cone shape and place in thimble.
2. Place 5-6 glass beads in the boiling flask and fill Vl/2 full
with Pentane.
3. Fit extractor onto flask and insert thimble into extractor.
Label the extractor with the sample code identification.
Complete assembly by attaching condenser and clamping entire
apparatus in position in steam bath.
4. Supply power to the heating mantle through the variable trans-
former. There should be sufficient heat to result in one dis-
charge cycle about every ten minutes. Extract each sample for
24 hours. During the first cycle, check the seating of the
ground glass joints by rotating the joints while pushing the
condenser/extractor and extractor/flask together. Check for
solvent loss periodically throughout the extraction. Also
check that the solvent is wetting the resin bed.
5. At the completion of the extraction, turn off power to the
heating mantle and allow the extractor to cool. Remove the
condenser. Pull out the thimble allowing all remaining sol-
vent to drain into the extractor. Transfer the extracted sam-
ple to, a glass bottle; label with the sample code identifica-
tion and return to the sample bank.
6. Siphon off any, solvent-in the extractor into the boiling flask.
Remove the extractor. Transfer the contents (minus the glass
beads) of the boiling flask to an appropriate size volumetric
flask. Rinse the boiling flask with three 10 ml rinses of the
extraction solvent and add these rinsings to the volumetric
flask. Make the volumetric flask to standard volume with the
extraction solvent, label with the sample code identification,
stopper and shake to blend.
7. Remove 2 ml of the extract sample with a pipette and transfer
to a liquid scintillation vial. Label the flask with the sam-
ple code identification. Place both the extract sample and the
2 ml aliquot in the sample bank.
8. With every set of samples extracted, prepare a blank by follow-
ing steps 2 through 7. Leave the glass thimble empty, except
for the glass wool. If Whatman No. 1 filters are used in the
extraction of a set of samples, then the blank is prepared by
adding a pre-extracted Whatman No. 1 to the glass thimble.
