Elution of Sample
1. Position a 25-ml graduated cylinder as a receiver under the
column. Transfer the prepared sample into the column. Rinse
weighing funnel into the column three times with 1 ml of
pentane each time. Begin adding 22 ml of pentane, and start
elution at a flow rate not greater than 1 ml/min. Collect
22 ml of pentane, adding more to the column if necessary. Do
not allow pentane to go below the top of the bed.
2. When 22 ml of pentane are collected, the pentane level is at
the top of the bed. In a graduated cylinder, take 10 ml of
Eluent No. 2. Rinse the glass weighing boat with 2 ml of
Eluent No. 2 into the column. Add the remaining 8 ml of Eluent
No. .2 into the column and start eluting. Collect 3 ml of
eluent in the 25 ml receiver. Stop elution. This is the first
fraction. Label this and succeeding fractions as they are
collected.
3. After the first fraction has been collected, place a 10 ml
volumetric flask under the column as receiver. Start elution
and collect 10 ml of Fraction 2, adding small amount of Eluent
No. 2, 20% CH Cl2 in pentane, as necessary. At the end of
2
collection, the solvent level must be at the origin. This is
fraction No. 2.
4. Replace the receiver with another 10-ml volumetric flask.
Take 10 ml of Eluent No. 3, 50% CH2Cl2/pentane in a graduated
cylinder. Rinse glass weighing boat with 2 ml into the col-
umn. Start elution, adding remaining solvent. Collect 10 ml
of Fraction No. 3, adding small amounts of the solvent if nec-
essary. Again, the solvent level must be at the origin.
5. Repeat step 4 with the remaining eluents:
• CH C1 , 10 ml
2 2
• 5% CH30H/CH2C12, 10 ml
• 20% CH30H/CH2C12, 10 ml
• 50% CH30H/CH Cl2, 10 ml
2
• Cone. HCl/CH /OH/CH2Cl2 (5:70:30), 25 ml

6. In the area specified for solvent evaporation, quantitatively
transfer sample Fractions 1-7 into precleaned, tared, and
labeled aluminum microweighing dishes. Fraction 8 is trans-
ferred into a small tared and labeled glass petri dish. Quan-
titative transfer is finally effected by rinsing each sample
fraction receiver two times with 2-ml volumes of mcthylene
chloride.
