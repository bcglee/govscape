6.2 EMISSIONS ASSESSMENT
Emissions of volatile hydrocarbons were estimated from the C7-C16 GC anal-
ysis of the Lear-Siegler train samples, while the GC/MS analyses of these sam-
ples showed the presence of phthalate esters and/or silicones. These compounds
were present in negligible amounts. Despite the uncertainties in the analyti-
cal data, the C7-C16 GC analytical results can be used with some degree of con-
fidence to give estimates of the emissions of volatile hydrocarbons during the
