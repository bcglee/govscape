7. The solvents are allowed to evaporate. When Fraction 8 appears
dry, dissolve It in CH2C12 and transfer to a second tared and
labeled glass petri dish, This transfer is intended to sepa-
rate organics from silica from the column. When all fractions
appear dry, weigh twice daily until stability occurs: ±0.002 mg.
8. After final weights are obtained, store the dishes in a desic-
cator and return to sample controller.
Calculations
Data collected are:
• Weights of sample until constant weight was achieved.
• Weights of the fraction until constant weights were achieved.
t Weights of the blank fractions until constant weights were
achieved.
The weights of the sample fraction are corrected for the weights of the
corresponding blank fractions.
Data transmitted to program management will be the corrected fraction
weights; For internal use, the percentage overall recovery and weight per-
centage distribution in the fractions will also be calculated, . ;
Accuracy and Precision
Presently there are no data by which this procedure can be evaluated.
Accuracy and precision appear to be sufficient for Level 1 analyses.
7. INFRARED ANALYSIS
Scope and Application
This procedure is used to determine the functional group types present in
an organic sample of LC fraction of a partitioned sample. The IR data, when
interpreted, provide information on functionality, e.g., carbonyl, aromatic
hydrocarbon, alcohol, amine, aliphatic hydrocarbon, halogenated organic, etc.
Compound information is possible only when that compound is known to be pres-
ent as a dominant constituent in the sample. However, such foreknowledge is
normally unlikely,
Sample amounts required for this analysis are in the milligram (mg) range.
A compound must be present in the sample at about 558-10% (w/w) or more in order
