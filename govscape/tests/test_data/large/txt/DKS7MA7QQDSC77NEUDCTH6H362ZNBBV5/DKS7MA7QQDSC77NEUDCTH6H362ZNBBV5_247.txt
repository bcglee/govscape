could be maintained. All glass parts outside the tube furnace were wrapped with
aluminum foil to prevent degradation of the 2,3,7,8-TCDD (TCDD) samples by
uv radiation.
3. PROCEDURE
The procedure was the same for all tests. The apparatus was first leak
tested. The sample was added to the glass boat which was then moved to the
center of the furnace. The nitrogen purge was started at the same time as the
vacuum pump. The flow rate was adjusted to 0.5 liters per minute, and the
vacuum was adjusted to maintain an interior pressure of 14 psia. The furnace
was then turned on and maintained at 100°C for 30 minutes to evaporate the
benzene solvent. Then the oven was brought slowly to 40Q°C, at which tempera-
ture it was kept for 2 hours. The system was then allowed to cool under the
nitrogen purge. After cooling, it was disassembled for sample recovery.
Four tests were performed. The first test was a blank in which benzene
alone rather than TCDD standards were used. In the second test, 30 ug of TCDD
were used. In the third and fourth tests, 60 ug of TCDD were used.
4. SAMPLE RECOVERY
The sample boat was placed in an amber colored glass bottle containing
100 ml of pentane and allowed to soak for 30 minutes. The boat was removed
and rinsed into the bottle. The .glass chamber and connecting line to the
inlet of the sorbent trap were filled with pentane and allowed to stand for
5 minutes. This wash was collected. The chamber and lines were rinsed with
additional pentane. The washes and rinses of the boat, chamber, and connect-
ing line were combined as one sample.
Each of the two benzene impingers downstream of the sorbent trap was
treated as a separate sample. The benzene contents were recovered. Each
impinger was rinsed with benzene, and the rinsings were combined with the
recovered contents.
The sorbent trap resin was extracted with pentane in a soxhlet apparatus
using standard procedures described in detail in Appendix C. After the resin
was removed from the trap, the trap interior was rinsed with pentane, and these
rinses were added to the extraction flask. An extraction blank was prepared
in an identical manner.
