Procedure
1. Rinse the weighing dishes with the high purity Pentane. Allow
them to air dry, store overnight in a stainless steel desic-
cator charged with PgOs, label with the sample code identifi-
cation of the samples to be determined, weigh on the micro-
balance and record the tare weights.
2. Rinse a 0.5 ml pipette with methylene chloride and dry with a
stream of pressurized nitrogen.
3. With the pipette, transfer 0.5 ml of the concentrate sample
from its volumetric flask to the appropriately labeled weigh-
ing dish. Record the volume of the concentrate sample before
removing the 0.5 ml aliquot. Repeat Step Z before pipetting
each sample.
4. Return the concentrate samples to the sample bank.
5. Allow the samples in the weighing dishes to evaporate at
ambient conditions in a clean fume hood until visually dry.
Store overnight in the desiccator and then weigh on the micro-
balance. Record this weight.
6. Place the samples in the sample bank.
Calculations
Subtract the tare weight from the final sample weight for each sample.
This gives the weight of the organic residue. Multiply the residue weight by
the aliquot factor to obtain the total organic residue in the concentrate
sample. :

tare weight) . """' A1 if quo t, volume "...residue (mg)

Scope and Application
Scope
This procedure defines the Level 1 analysis of environmental samples for
volatile hydrocarbons. This procedure assumes an appropriate sample given to
the analyst. No sample preparation is discussed.
