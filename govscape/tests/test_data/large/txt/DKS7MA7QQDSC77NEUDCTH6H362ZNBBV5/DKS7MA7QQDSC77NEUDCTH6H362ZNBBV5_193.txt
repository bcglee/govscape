f that had been tested against the animals revealed the presence of 27 ±8 ppm
j TCDD. Subsequent study of standard 2,4,5-T containing less than 1 ppm TCDD
given to rats by gavage in doses up to 24 mg/kg dally, failed to reveal evi-
dence of teratogenic or embryotoxic effects (Emerson <*£ aj_., 1970). Under
similar conditions, TCDD produced no effect at a dose of 0.03 yg/kg/day while
doses of 0.125 ng/kg/day or greater manifested toxicity to the fetus and at
8.0 jag/kg/day to the mother also (Sparschu el^aK, 1970),
(3) Evaluating Data from Animal Models; The metabolism of attest
compound is a highly relevant consideration in teratogenesis. If the metabolic
pathway in the test animal differs radically from that in man, then the results
of a study are unlikely to be useful for the assessment of hazards arising from
trace contaminants. The findings of teratogenesis or embryotoxicity has mean-
ing only in the appropriate animal species (Goldberg, 1971). Theodor D. Sterling
. (1971) of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, Washington
University, St Louis, examined the difficulty of evaluating the toxicity and
teratogenicity of 2,4,5-T from existing animal data. He notes that the question
has been raised as to whether the herbicide 2,4,5-T is toxic and teratogenic to
an extent to. preclude its use, in this country at least. Sterling states, .
"Although we can learn a great deal from animal experiments, toxicological and
ter.a to logical information from animal experiments turns out to be much less
useful, especially for making broad policy decisions, than is commonly thought."
(4) Design of^Recent 2!,4 5-T Toxicity Studies: To quote Sterling
r
(1971) again, "...there are less than a dozen key reports.,.of study on toxicity
of 2,4,5-T, dating back to the early 1950's for the most part, and on its ter-
atogenicity, mostly done in the last two years. Whereas the toxicity studies
were done at some leisure and the teratogenicity studies had some aspect of
emergency about them, they are indistinguishable in their lack of adequate
statistical experimental design and analysis of data."
6. :. EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION POSSIBILITY: The possibility
that an extraordinarily toxic contaminant of a widely used herbicide may be
sufficiently stable in the environment and soluble in fat or other tissues to
enter food chains and ultimately the human diet is worthy of consideration.
It was known, of course, that 2,4,5-T does not accumulate to any significant
degree in animal tissues, but data on tissue storage of dioxin were not
