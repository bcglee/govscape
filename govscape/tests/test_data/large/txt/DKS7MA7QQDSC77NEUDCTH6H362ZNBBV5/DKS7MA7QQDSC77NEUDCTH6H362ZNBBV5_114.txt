4.3.2 Problems with On-Line Instrumentation
During land-based incinerator tests, the on-line instrumentation was housed
in an automotive van equipped as a portable laboratory. No problems were
encountered with-the on-line instruments during the land based tests despite
the long drives from site to site and corrosiveness of many of the wastes.
For the at-sea incineration tests, a standard shipping container was mod-
ified as a portable laboratory to house the instruments. During the Gulf of
Mexico tests, a progressive baseline drift of the CO, analyzer was encountered,
and more frequent calibration was necessary.
During the Herbicide Orange burns, there were considerable difficulties
with the on-line instrumentation as described in Section 3.2. Usable data were
acquired although more frequent calibration and tuning were necessary. It is
believed, however, that problems with the on-line instruments were caused by
system design oversights rather than by any problems inherent in the instruments
themselves or by their use.
The system design errors were cold spots in the lines conducting the com-
bustion effluent gas samples from the probe to the on-line instruments. A single
heat-traced line led from the observation deck to the portable laboratory where
it was,connected to a manifold. Valves in this,manifold permitted the operator
to switch the combustion effluent to either gas conditioner. Heat traced lines
led from the manifold to the gas conditioner. The manifold itself, however,
was not heated. Consequently, condensation may have occurred, and the conden-
sate would have been quite corrosive because of the HC1 content of the combus-
(&.
tion effluent. The Perma-Pure^ dryer 1n each gas conditioner was designed to
remove only water vapor. Therefore, liquid water could have passed through the
gas conditioners.
In the equipment mounting rack containing the on-line instruments were
inlet and outlet manifolds which distributed sample gas to and recombined sample
gas from the instruments. Neither of these manifolds was heated. Condensate
was observed in the outlet manifold, and some condensate drained into and
damaged the CO analyzers.
