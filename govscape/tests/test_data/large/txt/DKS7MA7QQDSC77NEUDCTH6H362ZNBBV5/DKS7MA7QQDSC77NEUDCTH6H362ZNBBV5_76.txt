Organic compound emissions are grouped Into three general categories:
• Gaseous - compounds boiling below 90°C
• Volatile - compounds boiling between 90° and 300°C
• Nonvolatile - compounds boiling above 300°C
Gaseous compounds were determined by the C1-C6 gas chromatographic (GC)
procedure. This analysis determined only amounts of organic compounds. No
attempt to identify compound classes or individual species was made. The sam-
®
pies in this program were taken in Tedlar gas sampling bags and analyzed at
TRW. There was no sample preparation.
Volatile organic compounds were determined by the C7-C16 GC procedure and
by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The amounts of organic compounds were
determined by the C7-C16 GC analysis. Compound classes and individual species
were determined by the GC/MS analysis. Sample preparation was by extraction
and concentration for solid samples and by concentration for liquid samples.
Nonvolatile organic compounds were determined by gravimetry, infrared
speotrophotometry, and thermogravimetry. The gravimetric analysis determines
the weight of nonvolatile residue obtained from concentrated samples. For this
program, the residue weights were large. Therefore, thermogravimetric analyses
were performed to determine whether the residues were wholly or only partially
organic. The combination of gravimetry and thermogravimetry gave a measure of
the amount of nonvolatile organic compounds in a sample. Infrared analyses
identified classes of organic compounds in a residue. The combination of the
three techniques thus gave estimates of the amounts of nonvolatile organic com-
pound emissions and the clashes of compounds being emitted. If a residue was
large, it was separated into eight fractions, each of which was analyzed by
gravimetry and infrared spectrophotometry.

The extent of sample preparation varied with sample type. The sample types
acquired were:
• Sorbent traps
• Probe rinses
• Heat traced line rinses
• Burner residues
