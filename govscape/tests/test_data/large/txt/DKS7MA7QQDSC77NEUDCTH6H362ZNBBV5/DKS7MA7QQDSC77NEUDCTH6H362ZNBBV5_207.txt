column at all and will not be reported. Consequently, the other phases of
Level I analysis scheme must be performed to obtain full information on the
sample. Species bo-iling below 90°C are determined in the C1-C6 GC analysis,
and species boiling above 300°C are determined in the LC analysis.
Calibration Limitations - Quantisation is based on calibration with
n-decane. Data should therefore be reported as, e.g., mg CS/m as n-decane.
Since response varies linearly with carbon number (over a wide range the
assumption may involve a 20% error), it is clear that heptane (C7) detected in
a sample and quantitated as decane will be overestimated. Likewise, dodecane
(C12) quantitated as decane will be underestimated. From previous data, it is
estimated the error involved is of the order of 2-3%.
Detection Limitations - The sensitivity of the flame ionization detector
varies from compound to compound. However, n-alkanes as a class have a greater
response than other classes. Consequently, using a n-alkane as a calibrant
and assuming equal responses of all other compounds tends to give low reported
values.
Summary of Method
A sample (unconcentrated extract or neat organic liquid) is analyzed by
gas chromatography. With boiling point-retention time and response-amount cal-
ibration curves, the data (peak retention times and peak areas) are interpreted
thusly: peak areas in boiling point range-s obtained from the boiling point-
retention time calibration are summed. With the response-amount calibration
curve, the area sums are converted to amounts of material in the reporting
ranges.
After the instrument is set up, the boiling point-retention time calibra-
tion is effected by injecting a mixture of n-C7 through n-C16 hydrocarbons and
running the standard temperature program. Response-amount calibration is
effected from the n-decane peak areas obtained above.
