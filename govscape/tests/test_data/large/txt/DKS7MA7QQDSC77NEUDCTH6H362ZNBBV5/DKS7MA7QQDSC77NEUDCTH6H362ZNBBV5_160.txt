6. SAFETY PROCEDURES AND MONITORING
The safety of all shipboard personnel will have top priority during the
incineration of Herbicide Orange onboard the M/T Vulcanus. As a minimum, the
following safety precautions are required as they apply before, during and after
burn operations. These safety precautions are grouped by participating organ-
izations to define and emphasize areas of responsibility.
M/T Vulcanus
1) All waste tank openings and viewing ports shall be closed.
A closed system shall be maintained such that vapors do not
escape into the atmosphere for the duration of the operation.
2) Any Herbicide Orange spills, leaks or residuals detected
, shall be immediately contained and decontaminated.
;
. 3) Measuring the tankage contents shall be with a closed gaging,
; system. A schedule of tank content measurement and rate of
depletion shall be established.
4) The cause of apparently random and often severe vibrations
from the incinerators at frequent intervals during previous
waste burns shall be identified. Steps to eliminate this
condition shall be identified and implemented.
5) Fugitive Herbicide Orange emissions from the waste pumping
room or any other source shall be eliminated.
6) An automatic shut-off device shall be in operation on both
furnaces, set to turn off the flow of Herbicide Orange if
the flame temperature drops below 1250°C.
7) The furnaces may be brought up to operating temperature at
a rate consistent with ship's practice and experience, using
fuel oil. When a flame temperature of 1280°C has been
reached in the furnace (using correlated thermocouple or
optical pyrometer measurements) the feed stock may be switched
over to Herbicide Orange. The practice of converting to
Herbicide Orange feed by putting furnaces on stream succes-
sively should be followed. The temperature of the furnace
as read at the control panel should not be allowed to drop
