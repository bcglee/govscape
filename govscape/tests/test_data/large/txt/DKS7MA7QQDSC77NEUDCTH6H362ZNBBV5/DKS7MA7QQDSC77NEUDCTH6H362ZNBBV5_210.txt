Preparation of Standard - A series of standard n-alkane solutions may be
prepared thusly. Take 10 wl each of the pure n-C7 through n-C16 alkanes and
dilute to 10 ml in a volumetric flask with pentane. Prepare three additional
standards, each 10-fold more dilute than the preceding one. Use densities at
20°C.
Procedure
1. The programmer Upper Limit is set at 150°C. (If this setting
does not produce a column temperature of 150°C, find the cor-
rect setting.)
\
2. The programmer Lower Limit is set at 20°C.
3. Verify the instrument and samples at room temperature.
4. Inject 1 yl of the n-alkane mixture.
5. Start the integrator.
6. Start the recorder.
7. Shut the oven door.
8. Change mode to Automatic; turn Lower Limit dial to 30°C to
start the program.
9. Repeat Steps 1-8 a sufficient number of times so that the
relative standard deviation of the retention times for each
peak is <S%.
To attain the required retention time precision, both the carrier gas flow
rate and temperature program specifications must be followed.
This calibration is performed at the start of an analytical program. The
mixture is chromatographed at the start of each day.
Response Calibration
For the purpose of a Level 1 analysis the peak area data obtained above
for n-decane is adequate.
