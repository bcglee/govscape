b. Behavior in Humans; Gehring et_ a]_., (1973) studied the effects of
2,4,5-T at a dose level of 5 mg/kg ingested directly in a slurry of milk. Ana-
lytical grade 2,4,5-T having a purity of greater than 99% and containing less
than the detectable level 0,05 ppm, of TCDD was used. Complete medical histories,
physical and laboratory studies were accomplished before and repeated after the
study. It was found that the clearances of 2,4,5-T and the excretion from the
body were by first-order rate processes with half-lives of 23.10 and 23.06 hours,
respectively. Essentially all of the ingested 2,4,5-T was absorbed into the
body and was excreted unchanged in the urine. Following ingestion, 65% of the
2,4,5-T remained in the plasma where 98% was reversibly bound to the plasma
proteins. "No untoward effects associated with the ingestion of 5 mg/kg,
2,4,5-T were detected in any of the subjects." (Gehring e_t al_., 1973) A metal-
lic taste lasting 1-2 hours following ingestion was reported by most of the sub-
jects. It was also concluded that essentially all of the ingested 2,4,5-T was
absorbed and then eliminated unchanged in the urine.
c. Behavior in Aquatic Systems and Aquatic Animals
(1) Metabolism and Distribution
(a) General Compari sons: The behavior of the chlorophenoxy
herbicides in non-mammalian aquatic animals is quite different than the behav-
ior described for terrestrial mammals and birds. The herbicides have a greater
toxic potential for aquatic animals. First, the route of entry is different in
