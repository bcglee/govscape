Sample Hand!ing and Preservation
The traveler for this analysis will specify the volume of concentrated
extract to be taken to give an appropriate weight of material for the separa-
tion. This specified volume is withdrawn with a graduated pipette. Then the
sample is returned to storage.

Procedure
The volume of samples expected during the Source Assessment program means
that a reasonable number of LC separations will be performed. Six columns is
the maximum that will be operated by any single analyst. Of these six columns,
one will be a blank (no sample added to column).
