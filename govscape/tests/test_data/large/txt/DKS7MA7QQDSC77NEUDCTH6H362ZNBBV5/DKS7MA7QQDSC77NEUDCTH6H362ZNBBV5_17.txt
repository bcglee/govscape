5. An automatic shut-off device shall be in operation on both
furnaces, set to turn off the flow of waste if the flame
temperature drops below 1250Â°C.
6. The Herbicide Orange feed rate to each incinerator shall not
exceed 11.5 tonnes/hour (11.5 metric tons/hour).
7. Incineration shall take place in the presence of excess air
such that: there shall be a 3 mole percent minimum oxygen con-
tent in the combustion product gas.
8. The combustion efficiency of the incineration and destruction
efficiency of waste during the incineration will be at least
99.9 percent complete. If the efficiency level falls below
99.9 percent, the incinerators on the Vulcanus will be shut
down immediately until corrective measures which assure
99.9 percent combustion efficiency are applied,
9. The emission rates of TCDD, 2,4-0, or 2,4,5-T will not be in
excess of 0.1% of the total amounts of TCDD, 2,4-0 or 2,4,5-T
in the Herbicide Orange waste. (Wright State University had
responsibility for analyses to determine emission rates of
(TCDD.)
10.a. An automatic sealed monitoring device (black box) will be
installed to record incineration activities and temperatures
and camera to photograph the control panel every 15 minutes.
10.b. A manual log shall be kept and the following information
recorded at 1-hour intervals:
a. Time, date
b. "Black box" temperature
c. Controller temperature reading
d. Waste feed rates
e. Switching of waste tanks
f. Wind speed and direction
g. Location
(For the third burn, this requirement was changed to 2-hour
intervals.)
11. A device for addition of ammonia to make a visible plume will
be installed.
12. Permittees shall ensure their position during transport and
within the discharge site at all times by on-board naviga-
tional aids, and shall maintain documentation of position.
