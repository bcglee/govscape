esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Thus, the actual effect seen in nature might
well depend on ,a factor such as the degree of mixing in the affected body of
water. â€¢
(c) .Importance of Hydrolysis; It is important that when the
esters of 2,4~D and 2,4,5-T hydrolyze, their toxicity to aquatic animals is
decreased by almost a factor of 10 (paragraph (3)(b) below). In the static
situation described in the paragraph above (no aeration), the rate of hydroly-
sis was probably faster than the rate that the ester went into solution so
that lethal concentrations were never attained. Toxicity studies with fresh-
water and saltwater animals at EHL(K) have been the so-called "Static Bioassay"
in which no attempt is made to maintain a constant concentration of the herbi-
cide ester in each test chamber. "Concentrations" are theoretical and based
on volumes of herbicide and water mixed together rather than from analysis of
water to quantitate the herbicide. Most studies reported from literature are
of the same type. The toxicity tests at EHL(K) revealed that in both fresh-
water and saltwater, most of the test organisms had responded at twelve hours
of exposure. There was rarely any increase in mortality past 24 hours.
(d) Other Factors Affecting Actual Concentrations: Many other
factors can influence the concentration of N-butyl esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T
in a body of water. In studies where large amounts of Orange herbicide were
placed in water, the globules of the herbicide appeared to become coated with
an opaque material that may have inhibited the ester from going into solution.
Cope (1970) treated ponds with 0.5 ppm to 10 ppm propylene glycol butyl ether
ester (PGB'E) of 2,4-D. He was able to measure residues of herbicide absorbed
or adsorbed in vegetation and bottom sediment for 6 weeks after treatment in
the 10 ppm treated pond. Crosby (1966) reported that 2,4-D decomposes rapidly
In the presence of water and ultraviolet light.
(3) Toxicity
(a) Factors Af.fectlng Toxic 1 ty; The toxicity of the chloro-
phenoxy herbicides to aquatic animals varies considerably with many factors
such as water chemistry variables, temperature, and the particular salt, ester
or amine form of the herbicide considered. Species susceptibility varies
