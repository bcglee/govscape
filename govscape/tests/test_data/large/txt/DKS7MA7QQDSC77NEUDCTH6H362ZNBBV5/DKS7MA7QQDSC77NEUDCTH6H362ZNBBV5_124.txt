Results of these experiments are summarized schematically in Figure 18
which shows ship headings relative to wind direction which avoided plume
impact. For example, with the wind direction off the port side of the ship,
relative headings from 50 to 90 degrees (wind directly abeam) avoided plume
impact. This figure was developed during the first burn and was used for
proper ship orientation during the second and third burns.
5.5 INCIDENTS
5.5.1 Plume Impingements
There were several occasions of plume impingement or eddying of the plume
on the ship. During the first burn, plume impingements resul-ted from flame
extinguishment by layers of water floating on top of the waste in certain
tanks. During the third burn, there were several occasions when the plume-
partially eddied onto the ship because of high wind velocity and somewhat
erratic wind direction.
The first incident occurred at 9:50 a.m. on July 20 during the first burn.
It was caused by a flameout in both incinerators which resulted in the expul-
sion of dense white fumes from the incinerator stacks. The resultant vapors
