Reagents
®
Supplies of the following solvents, pesticide grade, Distilled-in-Glass ,
®
Nanograde or equivalent should be kept at hand in 1- or 2-liter quantities.
These solvents will be used to prepare analytical standards, make dilutions, do
solvent replacement or other similar activities as required.
• Benzene
t Pentane
• Methylene chloride
• Methanol
• Acetone
t Petroleum ether
• Hexane , .
• Diethyl ether
• 2,4-D butyl ester, EPA Reference Standard No. 2980
• 2,4,5-T butyl ester, EPA Reference Standard No. 6870.
Procedure
The samples will have been concentrated as greatly as practicable. The
samples, 0.25 ml, will have been placed in vials at the end of the concentra-
tion procedure (Section 5.4) and are then available for analysis.
PreparatiQn of Standard Solutions
It is intended to quantitate only 2,4-0 and 2,4,5-T mixed esters in these
samples. At the required destruction efficiency, the sorbent traps are expected
to yield extracts having 2,4-0 and 2,4,5-T concentrations of about 200 yg/yl
each. These samples may be diluted. Reference materials (2,4-0 and 2,4,5-T
butyl esters) are obtained from the U.S. EPA. Standards will be prepared in
benzene at levels of 200, 20, 2, and 0.2 yg/ul. The GC/MS will be calibrated
with these standards, and a curve of peak area versus weight of standard will
be prepared.
