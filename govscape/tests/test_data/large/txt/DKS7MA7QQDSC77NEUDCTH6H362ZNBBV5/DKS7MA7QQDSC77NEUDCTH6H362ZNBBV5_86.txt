These fractions contained acids which reacted with the aluminum weighing pans. The eighth fraction eluent
contains HC1, so that these solutions were evaporated in glass dishes.
sample was lost in analysis. The value reflects past experience with these fractions.
*These fractions were wet and/or had IR spectra indistinguishable from the corresponding blank.
