When all preparations have been completed, inject the sample into the gas
chromatograph which is in the solvent divert mode. At a given time after injec-
tion, the solvent divert valve directs the sample components eluting from the
GC into the MS. Concurrently, a signal is set to start the MS scanning sequence
and data acquisition of the mass spec/computer to acquire and store data in
accordance with the pre-programmed parameters. The instrument will then gather
and store data over the time interval during which the individual in the sample
will elute. The analysis will continue for a pre-set duration or until the
operator intervenes. The system will be programmed to stop the analysis after
^50 minutes have elapsed from time of injection. The elution time and tempera-
ture program may be changed as required by the species present in the sample.
Data Processing
The data system is directed to construct a total ion chromatogram from the
acquired data. Moreover, the system is ordered to enhance the data and/or to
perform background subtractions as required and then to search the mass spec-
tral library for matches to peaks in the reconstructed chromatogram. All
matches are evaluated visually by the operator. Butyl esters of 2,4-0 and
2,4,5-T will be quantitated by comparison with the standards. Other species
will be quantitated by inference.
