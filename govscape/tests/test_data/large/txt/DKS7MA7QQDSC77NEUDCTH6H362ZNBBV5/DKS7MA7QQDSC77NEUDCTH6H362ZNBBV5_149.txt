2. POTENTIAL HAZARDS
The Herbicide Orange requiring disposal is a viscous, clear amber orange
liquid containing 50 percent (±1.5%) by volume of the normal butyl ester of
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-0) and 50 percent (±1.5%) by volume of the
normal butyl ester of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). The highly
toxic contaminant present in Herbicide Orange is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin (TCDD). The U.S. Air Force has analyzed the Herbicide Orange stocks and
found TCDD concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 47.0 ppmw. Statistical evalua-
tion of these data indicated that pooled stocks would have an estimated average
TCDD concentration of 1.9 ppmw (±0.7 ppmw) at 95 percent confidence level.
The principal Herbicide Orange constituent of concern, TCDO, has been
found to be highly embryotoxic, teratogenic and acnegenic and is lethal in
the microgram-per-kilogram of body weight range. The detailed toxicological
properties of TCDD, as compiled by the U.S. Air Force, are described in Refer-
ence 1. The no-effect TCDD dose levels for embryotoxicity and chick endema are
o
0.03 to 0.1 pg/kg/day respectively. Assuming that a person inhales 30 m of
air in a 24-hr day and a body weight of 60 kg for an average person, the amount
of TCDD absorbed into the blood stream of a person will be less than 0.03 ug/kg X
60 kg = 1.8 yg if the ambient concentration of TCDD is less than 1.8/30 =
o
0.06 ug/m , even if the efficiency of pulmonary absorption is 100 percent.
Thus an ambient TCDD concentration of 0.06 ug/m may be considered as the no
effect level for humans. With the application of an additional safety factor
of 10, it is proposed that 6 ng/m be considered as the safe ambient concentra-
tion for TCDD for all personnel on board the M/T Vulcanus.
Teratogenic - tending to cause developmental malfunctions and monstrosities.
