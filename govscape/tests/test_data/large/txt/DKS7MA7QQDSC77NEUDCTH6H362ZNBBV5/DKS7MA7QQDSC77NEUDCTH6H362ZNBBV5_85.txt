Table 28 gives the residue weights of the Lear-Siegler train samples sep-
arated by liquid chromatography. Nhile all of the samples except the sorbent
traps of 7/14/77 and 7/16/77 met the criterion for the separation, only those
samples listed in Table 28 had sufficient material to perform the separation.
It is sometimes difficult to dry the latter three fractions, which contain
methane! in the eluent. Infrared spectra of several fractions showed that they
were not dry or were indistinguishable from the corresponding blank. Two frac-
tions (6 and 7) in the line rinse of 8/13/77 evidently contained inorganic
acids, as the aluminum evaporation-weighing dishes were partially dissolved.
Table 29 presents the interpretations of the IR spectra of the residues
from the LC separations which had sufficient material (greater than 0.1 mg).
Phthalate esters and/or silicones were again found in most of the residues.
Benzenold compounds and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were also found in
the line and probe rinse fractions.
Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses were performed on the con-
centrates from the Lear-Siegler train samples. These analyses were quantitative
for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. An attempt was made to identify other compounds found
and to give semi quantitative estimates of amounts. The results of these anal-
.yses are given in Table 30. There were a number of unidentifiable compounds.
The major reason for not being able to identify a compound was the lack of a
reference spectrum in the GC/MS spectral data library. To identify a compound,
the mass spectrum of that compound is compared with reference mass spectra in
the library. If no match is found, the compound cannot be identified.
It is noteworthy that neither 2,4-D nor 2,4,5-T was found in any of the
Lear-Siegler train samples. Phthalate esters and/or silicones were found in
all of the samples. Many interesting compounds were found. Fluorene was found
in the diesel fuel and in the line rinse from the fuel oil background. Dichlor-
obiphenyl, a polychlorinated biphenyl, was found in the sorbent trap samples
taken when herbicide was burned. However, no other polychlorinated biphenyls
were identified. The probe and heat-traced line rinses from the herbicide
tests contained a variety of aromatic compounds. A number of polynuclear aro-
matic compounds were identified.
