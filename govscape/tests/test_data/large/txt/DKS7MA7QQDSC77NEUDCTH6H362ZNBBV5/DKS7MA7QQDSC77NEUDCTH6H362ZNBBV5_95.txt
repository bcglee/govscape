burner residue samples. The presence of waste feed components in the burner
residues implies that the rotating cup burners remain quite cool relative to
the flame and the incinerator walls.
4.2.4 Wright State University Analytical Methodology
Wright State University has, under contract to the U.S. Air Force, d«v«loped
methodology for determining. TCDD in Herbicide Orange and in samples relating to
the storage and disposal of Herbicide Orange. Details of WSU methodology may
be found in Reference 6.
TCDD in composite feeds was isolated from the bulk of feedstock by liquid
chromatography on a mixed-bed silica gel/alumina column. The fraction contain-
ing TCDD was taken to dryness. Prior to analysis, the residue was taken up in
a known volume of benzene.
