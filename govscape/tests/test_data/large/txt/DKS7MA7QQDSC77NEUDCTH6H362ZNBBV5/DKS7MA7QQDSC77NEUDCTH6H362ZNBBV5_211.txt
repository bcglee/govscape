• Syringe and syringe cleaning apparatus.
• PPaarraammeetteerrss:: EElleeccttrroommeetteerr sseettttiinngg iiss 11 x 10" A/mV; recorder
is set at 1-in/min and 1 mV full-scale.
Procedure
1. Label chromatogram: date, sample number, etc.
2. Inject sample.
3. Start integrator, recorder, temperature.
4. Clean syringe.
5. Return sample: obtain new sample.
6. When analysis is finished allow instrument to cool. Turn
chromatograph and integrator output and data sheet over to
data analyst,
Syringe Cleaning
Apparatus
• Hamilton syringe cleaner connected to water aspirator.
• Reagent grade pentane and methylene chloride.
• Disposable pipettes and medicine dropper bulbs.
Procedure
1. Remove plunger from syringe.
2. Insert syringe into cleaner; turn on aspirator.
3. Fill pipette with pentane; run pentane through syringe.
4. Repeat with methylene chloride from a separate pipette.
5. Fill pipette with pentane; flush plunger with pentane.
6. Repeat with methylene chloride.
Calculations
Boiling Point - Retention Time Calibration
The required data for this calibration are on the data sheet. The data
reduction is performed thusly:
1. Average the retention times and calculate relative standard
deviations for each n-hydrocarbon.
