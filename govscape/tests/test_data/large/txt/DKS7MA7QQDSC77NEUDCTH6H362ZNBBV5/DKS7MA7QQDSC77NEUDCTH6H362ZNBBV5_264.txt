6. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCY CALCULATIONS
The calculation of destruction efficiency (DE) during this program was
based on the measurement of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in the
combustion effluent; the composition and concentrations of waste feed material;
and laboratory analyses of combustion effluent samples,
It is shown in the derivation in this appendix that these factors are suf-
ficient to identify the destruction efficiency without the use of oxygen and
waste feed rates because the destruction efficiency is a dimension!ess ratio.
The variance in destruction efficiency was calculated from the variance in the
factors above and their effect on the DE calculation.
1. DERIVATION OF VARIANCE OF DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCY
; Let:
W•* herbicide feed rate to each incinerator, metric tons per hour
A * air feed rate to each incinerator, dry m /hr at 20°C
o
P * combustion product flow rate from each incinerator, dry m /hr
at 20°C
E = % excess air
C * weight % carbon in Herbicide Orange
H = weight % hydrogen in Herbicide Orange
0 = weight % oxygen in Herbicide Orange
C& - weight % chlorine 1n Herbicide Orange
S * stoichiometric oxygen requirement for 100 g herbicide, moles
a * weight fraction 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T 1n herbicide
b « emission concentration of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T, metric tons/m3
d s weight fraction TCDD in herbicide
e * emission concentration of TCDD, metric tons/m
