5) V(Cji/C} variance in chlorine-to-carbon ratio in waste
s
After drums containing herbicide were drained, they were
rinsed. During Johnston Island dedrumming operations,
drums averaged 50 gallons of herbicide, and drum rinses
averaged 2 ±0.3 gallons of diesel fuel. The carbon con-
tent of diesel fuel was taken as 84.9% and its specific
gravity as 0,778. From Table 8, the carbon and chlorine
contents of the herbicide were 49.11 and 29.87%, respec-
tively. From these data, the ±2s range for the CA/C
ratio is 0.5798 to 0.5870. Therefore,
= 0.5834

6) VCOg) variance in oxygen content of combustion effluent
Table 16 presents gas composition data for all three burns.
From these data, the average and standard deviation of % 0~
were calculated:
= 8.9
= 1.4
7) VXCOg), variance in carbon dioxide content of combustion
effluent
From data presented in Table 16, the average and standard
deviation at % C0 were calculated:

8) Values for K and K' were obtained from the average herbi
cide composition. From Table 8,
carbon = 49,11%
chlorine = 29.87%
