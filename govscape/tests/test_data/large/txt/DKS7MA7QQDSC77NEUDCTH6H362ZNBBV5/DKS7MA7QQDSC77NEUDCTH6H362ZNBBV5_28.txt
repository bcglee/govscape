operation is stated by the ship's chief engineer to be between 75,000 and
80,000 cubis meters per hour at ambient conditions.
Liquid wastes are fed to the combustion system by means of electrically
driven pumps. Upstream of each burner supply pump is a device (Gorator) for
reducing the solids in the waste to a pumpable slurry. The Gorator also acts
as a mixing pump by recirculating the waste through the waste tank. Power for
the blowers, pumps and other parts of the incinerator system is supplied by
two diesel-generators with a total capacity of 750 kW at 440 volts and
60 Hertz.
Three burners of the vortex type are located at the same level on the
periphery of each furnace near its base. The burners are of a rotating cup,
concentric design and deliver waste or fuel oil through a central tube to an
atomization nozzle, where it meets high velocity air delivered through an
annulus. The burners are positioned as shown in Figure 5.
