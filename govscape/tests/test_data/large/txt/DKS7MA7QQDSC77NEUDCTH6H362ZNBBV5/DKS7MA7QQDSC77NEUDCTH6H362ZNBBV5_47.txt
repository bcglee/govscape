.The Plastomatic 2000 control system did not instantaneously shut off the
flow of material to the incinerators. There is a built-in electrical circuit
time delay in this system of unknown but presumably short duration. In addition,
controller thermocouples are imbedded in the incinerator firebrick walls and are
not directly exposed to the flame environment. Consequently, a thermal lag exists
between a decrease in flame temperature and the corresponding reduction in fire-
brick temperature sensed by the controller thermocouple. This thermal lag is
also of unknown duration. Total time lag (electrical plus thermal) of the system
exceeded the brief durations of the flameouts.
During the post-burn debriefing on Johnston Island, procedures were devel-
oped to flash (evaporate) the contaminated water and to avoid plume impingements
caused by flameouts. Full discussions of the flameouts and procedures are given
in Section 5.
3.2.2 Second Burn Commentary and Prpblems
The M/T Vulcanus sailed from Johnston Island at 0830 hours on 6 August
1977. At 2030 hours on 6 August a star fix indicated the ship was within the
bum zone, and at 2144 hours the first burner was changed from diesel oil feed
to herbicide feed. The on-line monitor system obtained data throughout the
:
changeover period. The Vulcanus finished the second shipload of herbicide at
2000 hours on 16 August 1977 and docked at Johnston Island at 0800 on 17 August.
Throughout the second burn, weather and sea conditions were much milder
than during the first burn. The wind speed was quite stable, averaging
10 m/sec (20 knots). There were no plume impingements. The procedure devel-
oped after the first burn to prevent flameouts worked satisfactorily. Sampling
and monitoring activities were accomplished as planned.
Inoperative CO and hydrocarbon analyzers had been sent back to the manufac-
turer for refurbishment after the first burn. The instruments were returned in
time for installation before sailing for the second burn. In addition, the U.S.
Air Force supplied a third CO analyzer.
Because of the first burn flameouts, residual material was left in several
tanks (Section 4.1.2). The residuals were sampled and analyzed after returning
to Johnston Island. Most of the residual material was herbicide, but there was
a layer of water (on top of the herbicide) which contained about 1% sodium
