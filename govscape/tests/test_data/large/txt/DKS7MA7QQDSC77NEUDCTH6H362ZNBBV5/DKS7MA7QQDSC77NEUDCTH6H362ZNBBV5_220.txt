Procedure for Crystalline Material -
The preferable IR sample preparation for crystalline or powdery materials
is a KBr pellet. Mix the sample thoroughly to ensure homogeneity. Take about
1 mg of sample and mix with typically 300 mg of KBr powder (amounts can be
adjusted to meet specifications of the KBr pellet die used). A small mortar
and pestle can be used to mix the sample, but the use of a sample amalgamator
or motorized grinder is probably preferable. Add the mixture to the pellet die,
assemble and press the pellet according to the manufacturer's instructions, and
check for .re, solution (see Note below). The resulting pellet is placed in the
instrument,Vs sample stage, and it is scanned using the parameters in Table C-l.
Normally, the ratio of 1 mg to 300 mg KBr powder yields a spectrum of the
proper intensity. However, more sample can be added, or the pellet diluted
with more KBr, reground, and rerun as required.
Note .on Resolution '.
The instrument settings affecting resolution will vary somewhat with dif-
ferent instrument manufacturers and models. The instrument preparation shall
include a test scan using a standard polystyrene film. Comparison of the
obtained spectra with an acceptably resolved standard spectra for the standard
will demonstrate that the instrument is performing acceptably. This resolution
..check shall be performed at least once each day that samples are analyzed.
The resulting spectra are interpreted by one with training and experience
in this field. Access to the several general and special literature sources
on IR interpretation are assumed.
Calculations
Calculations are not required in this qualitative technique.
Accuracy and Precision
Values cannot be given owing to (1) the variable nature of the sample and
(2) the qualitative, not quantitative, nature of the analyses.

Scope and Application
This procedure is a survey analysis used to determine compound types in an
organic sample or in an LC fraction of a sample. The analyst is specifically
