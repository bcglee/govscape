used coveralls and shoe covers were provided in the shower area just inside the
boundary. These cans were emptied daily and their contents burned.
A shower,was installed in the combustion room at the port entrance just
off the main deck (Figure 17). Soap, cotton-tipped swabs, powder, and fungi-
cide were available. The water from the shower drained off the ship and into
the ocean. The shower was for use by personnel going off duty from the combus-
tion room or from other contamination sources, such as the pump room or storage
area.
An onboard analytical chemistry capability was discussed in Section 4.2.9.
An extensive sampling and monitoring program was followed. To detect the spread
of contamination or excessive workspace air levels of herbicide, onboard gas
chromatographic analyses of the following types of samples were performed:
• Areas critical with respect to the spread of contamination or
likely to be sources of contamination were wiped with filter
paper discs and then analyzed.
• Workspace air samples were taken by gas sampling syringes and
analyzed. . ^ .

In addition, combustion efficiency was measured daily in order to deter-
mine that the permit requirement of at least 99.9% efficiency was met.
Monitoring activities included continuous workspace air samples (Sec-
tion 3.4.1) and ship's drinking water. These samples were analyzed after
each burn on Johnston Island.
5.3 RESULTS
Descriptions of the sampling techniques and equipment, analytical method-
ology, and results of the analyses used to implement the personnel protection
plan are given in Sections 3 and 4. Analytical results and their implications
with respect to the personnel protection plan are discussed in following
sections.
5.3.1 Wipe Samples
Examination of suspected areas of contamination was carried out by wiping
sections of the deck, walkways, and walls with filter paper. The wipes were
placed in individual screw cap bottles and subjected to gas chromotographic
