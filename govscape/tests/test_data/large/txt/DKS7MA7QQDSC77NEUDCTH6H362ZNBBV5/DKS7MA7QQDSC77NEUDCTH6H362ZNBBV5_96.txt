This sample was lost. The value reflects past experience for
these fractions. ;

*These samples were not completely dry, and their infrared spectra
were indistinguishable from the corresponding blanks.
A portion of each impinger sample was washed with aqueous base and then
water. After washing, the organic fraction was dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate. After drying, the organic layer was decanted and combined with a
petroleum ether wash of the sodium sulfate. Both organic layers were taken
to dryness. Prior to analysis, the residue was dissolved in a known volume
of benzene.
A 10 ml portion of each probe and line rinse was reduced in volume to
0.5 ml and then diluted to 1.0 ml with benzene. The samples then consisted
of a brown, water miscible layer and the benzene layer. Aliquots of the
benzene layer were taken for analysis.
Analyses for TCDD were performed on an AEI MS-30 double focusing mass
spectrometer coupled to a Varian 1440 gas chromatograph.
