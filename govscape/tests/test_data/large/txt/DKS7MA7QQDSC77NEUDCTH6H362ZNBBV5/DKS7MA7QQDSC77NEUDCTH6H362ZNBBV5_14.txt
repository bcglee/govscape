ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This efforfwas successfully accomplished because of the assistance and
cooperation of a large number of individuals and their respective organizations.
Equipment design and development, definition of sampling requirements, the
acquisition of samples and their subsequent analyses were accomplished by per-
sonnel from the Applied Technology and Environmental Engineering Divisions of
TRW, Inc., Redondo Beach, California. Analyses of certain types of samples
were performed by the Brehm Laboratory of Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio;
by Battelle-Columbus Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio; and by U.S. Air Force Occupa-
tional and Environmental Health Laboratories, Kelly and Brooks Air Force Bases,
Texas. Engineering liaison to adapt test equipment for use onboard the M/T
Vulcanus was facilitated by the management of Ocean Combustion Services, B.V.,
of The Netherlands. Installation of this equipment, as well as the acquisition
of data and samples, was accomplished through the assistance of the ship's
officers and crew. Complete cooperation was received from Johnston Island per-
sonnel of Holmes and Narver, Inc., Anaheim, California.
Technical direction, assistance, and planning of the conceptual design and
implementation of this program were received from a number of agencies and orga-
nizations within the U.S. Government. These include the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency's Oil and Special Materials.Control Division (OSMCD), Washington,
D.C., Industrial Environmental. Research Laboratory (IERL), Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina, and the Regional Office, Region IX, San Francisco,
California; the U.S. Air Force's Occupational and Environmental Health Labora-
tories (OEHL), Kelly and Brooks Air Force Bases, Texas, and McClellan Air Force
Base, California; the Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, Dayton, Ohio; the Military Sealift Command; the Military Airlift Command;
and the Defense Nuclear Agency. The Honolulu, Hawaii, Communications Station
of the U.S. Coast Guard provided communications between the M/T Vulcanus and
Johnston Island. U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Washington, D.C., provided
guidance in installation of equipment on the Vu'lcanus to conform with U.S. mari-
time regulations.
