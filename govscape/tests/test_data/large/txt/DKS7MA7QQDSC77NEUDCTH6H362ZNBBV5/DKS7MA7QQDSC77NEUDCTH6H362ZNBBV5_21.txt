Data from the on-line analyzers and the results of the analyses of the
stack samples were used to calculate incineration efficiencies. Combustion
efficiencies were calculated from the on-line monitoring data. Four different
waste destruction efficiencies were calculated, one from the hydrocarbon ana-
lyzer data and three from laboratory analyses. These incineration efficiency
terms are defined in Table 1. Average values for the incineration efficiencies
are given in Table 2.
Results of the analyses by TRW, WSU, and BCL and of the reduction of the
on-line monitoring data indicate that the performance of the Vulcanus1 incin-
erators was consistently greater than 99.9% in terms of combustion and destruction
efficiencies for 2.4-0 and 2,4,5-T and total organic material. Analyses of first
and third burn samples for TCDD led to destruction efficiencies greater than
99.9%. Analyses of second burn samples for TCDD led to destruction efficiencies
of >99.89% and >99.87%. The fact that these destruction efficiencies were appar-
ently marginally lower than the required 99.9% was because of problems during
the TCDD analyses (Section 4.2.5). Chemical interferences during the TCDD
analyses led to higher than usual detection limits. Although TCDD was detected
in only part of one of the second burn samples, the detection limits are such
that these two destruction efficiencies were calculated to be >99,89% and >99.87%
rather than 99.9%. It is considered, therefore, that the chemical interferences
