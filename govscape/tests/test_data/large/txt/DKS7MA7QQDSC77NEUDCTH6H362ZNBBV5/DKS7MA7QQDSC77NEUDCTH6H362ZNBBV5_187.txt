addition, plants in shade! areas respond more slowly than those exposed to
direct sunlight. Because of these various factors which affect plant response
to the 2,4-0 type herbicide, differences in lists showing plant susceptibility
should be expected. Orange herbicide is effective on a wide variety of woody
and broadleaf plant species, Other lower plant forms can also be affected by
auxin-type herbicides. Even unicellular algae exhibit toxic effects or die when
exposed to 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T [Walsh, 1972). However, much higher doses of the
herbicides are required than for plants with a more complex structure.
(3) Herbicides as Air Pollutants: Although herbicides have long
been accepted as environmental pollutants which affect sensitive vegetation,
the air pollution aspects of volatile herbicides have not been widely explored.
However, there is growing evidence that some 2,4-0 compounds may be present in
the ambient atmosphere in some parts of the United States at levels sufficient
to cause adverse growth effects on sensitive vegetation. During 1962 through
1964, Vernetti and Freed measured 2,4-D concentrations in air samples taken in
an agricultural area of eastern Oregon. Concurrently, they surveyed for auxin-
like plant damage in the areas where the air samples were taken. In the spring
of 1962, measured concentrations of the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D in the air
ranged from 0.015 ppm to 0.64 ppm. This was during the time of year when the
huge wheat fields of the area were being treated for weeds by aerial application
of the isopropyl ester. Plant damage to tomato crops appeared to coincide with
periods of highest measured concentrations of the isopropyl ester. Other plants,
especially locust trees., also showed growth regulator symptoms. Legislation
in the state curtailed the use of the isopropyl ester and decidedly reduced the
contamination and resulting plant damage. Laboratory studies by Vernetti and
Freed indicated that 0.015 ppm would be the threshold concentration of isopropyl
ester that-tomato plants could be exposed to and still survive under the condi-
tions of the experiment. Volatility studies by the same workers demonstrated
that the isopropyl ester was three times more volatile than the butyl ester.
In fact, complex analyses of the air samples ruled out butyl and other esters
of 2,4~D as principal contaminants.
(4) Relative Species Sensitivity: Different researchers vary in
their results of relative plant sensitivity to phenoxy herbicides. From field
observations, grapevines and box elder appear to be among the most sensitive
