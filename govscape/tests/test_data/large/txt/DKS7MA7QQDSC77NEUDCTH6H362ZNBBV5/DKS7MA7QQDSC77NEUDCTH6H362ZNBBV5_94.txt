A measure of the volatile organic content of the burner residue extracts
is given by the C7-C16 GC analyses. Results of these analyses are given in
Table 34. These data show a low volatile organic content.
The residue weights from both burner residue extracts exceeded the criteria
for performing in GC separation, table 35 presents the weights of the residues
from the fractions into which these samples were separated. The recovery from
one sample was high and probably the result of insufficient drying.
Infrared spectra were taken on the residues from each of the fractions.
The interpretation of these spectra in terms of classes of compounds are given
in Table 36. Phthalate esters and sllicones were again found. However, the
herbicide components 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were found, as well as a phenoxy compound
and a carboxylic acid.
GC/MS analyses were performed on the burner residue extracts, and the
results are presented in Table 37. The major herbicide components, 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T, were found as were other minor components. In the previous at-sea
incineration program, ' traces of waste feed components were also found in the
