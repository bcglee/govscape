1. INTRODUCTION
The Lear-Siegler sorbent trap system was used in the Herbicide Orange
program for two purposes. First, this sampling train was intended to acquire
combustion effluent samples for the purposes of assessing the emission burden
from the incineration. Secondly, the Lear-Siegler train was intended as a
back-up to the primary USAF-OEHL train for measurement of TCDD emissions.
Since the Uar-Siegler train had not been used to trap TCDD before this pro-
gram, it was required to test the trapping efficiency of the system.
2. TEST APPARATUS
A schematic of the test apparatus is shown in Figure E-l. The apparatus
'consisted of a tube furnace with a special designed tubular glass chamber which
extended beyond both, ends of the furnace. Specially designed glass boats for
containing test samples could be placed in the center of the glass chamber. A
thermocouple was placed directly over the glass boat.
The exit end of the glass chamber was connected to an all-glass sampling
train consisting of the following parts in series:
• The Lear-Siegler sorbent trap
0 Two benzene filled impingers
t One empty impinger
• One activated charcoal filled impinger
• One'silica gel! filled impinger
The last impinger was connected to a vacuum pump in order to maintain a
slight negative pressure in the entire system. The glass tubing between exit
end of the chamber and the sorbent trap was wrapped in heating tape and main-
tained at 190°C.
The upstream end of the glass chamber was connected to a nitrogen cylinder.
With a rotameter and needle valve, a constant nitrogen flow through the system
