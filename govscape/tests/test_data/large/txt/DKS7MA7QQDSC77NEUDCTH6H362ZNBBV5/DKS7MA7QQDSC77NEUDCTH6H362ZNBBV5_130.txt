5.6 SUMMARY OF SHIP CLEANLINESS MAINTENANCE
During the three burns of "Herbicide Orange onboard the M/T Vulcanus, the
following observations were made:
• Effective protection of operating and technical personnel from
Herbicide Orange exposure was achieved by isolating the mate-
rial from living areas and restricting it to operating areas.
Minor amounts of herbicide were detected in the living area
which was then readily decontaminated.
• There were no major exposures of personnel to Herbicide Orange
during the three incinerations.
• There were no large spills nor leaks.
• The walkways along the port and starboard main deck passageways
showed some contamination, which was easily hosed away.
/
• The principal source of contamination was the main deck about
the waste tank access hatches. As discussed in Section 5.5.2,
, there were minor herbicide spills during tank sampling before
the second and third burns. Herbicide from these spills
apparently migrated into the living areas because of uncon-
trolled personnel movement.
..::;; • , The••dl'sposabie fiber coveral 1 s and shoe covers appeared to be
; ; / 'effective. Disposal of these by burning in the furnace was
" easily accomplished.
'• The combustion room remained at a low level of contamination,
indicating excellent housekeeping and high quality engineer-
ing practice.
• The pump room was a source of Herbicide Orange vapors.
• The flameouts were a source of contamination, since vaporized
Herbicide Orange, left the stacks at a lower velocity and did
not behave as a normal plume because of its density and lower
temperature. Methods of controlling these flameouts were sug-
gested (Section 5.5.1) and put into operation successfully.
