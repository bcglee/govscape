1. INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND, AND SUMMARY
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Thermal destruction of combustible wastes at sea 1s recognized as an alter-
native to land based Incineration. In late 1974 and in March of 1977, organo-
chlorinevwastes were Incinerated in the Gulf of Mexico by the Motor Tanker (M/T)
Vulcanus. These efforts, evaluated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(U.S. EPA), provided a technical basis for concluding that at-sea incineration
is a viable alternative to other means of disposal.
Incineration of U.S. Air Force stocks of Herbicide Orange was performed
onboard the M/T Vulcanus operating in the Pacific Ocean west of Johnston Atoll.
Approximately 10,400 metric tons were incinerated under permits granted by the
U.S. EPA. The first shipload, loaded at the Naval Construction Battalion Cen-
ter at Gulfport, Mississippi, was' incinerated under Research Permit No. 770DH001R.
The second and third shiploads, loaded at Johnston Island (one of the islands
comprising Johnston Atoll), were incinerated under Special Permit No. 770DH001S.
The Herbicide Orange incinerated consisted of an approximate 50-50 mixture
by volume of the n-butyl esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and
2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-Tr . There was a small quantity of
Orange II herbicide which consisted of an approximate 50-50 mixture by volume of
2,4-D and the iso-octyl ester of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid^ . Certain
lots of the herbicide contained the contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin (TCDD). The TCDD concentration in the entire stock of herbicide averaged
1.9 ppm and ranged from 0 to 47 ppnr- . Diesel fuel used to rinse herbicide
drums and equipment associated with dedrumming and loading was mixed with the
herbicide for incineration. ,
