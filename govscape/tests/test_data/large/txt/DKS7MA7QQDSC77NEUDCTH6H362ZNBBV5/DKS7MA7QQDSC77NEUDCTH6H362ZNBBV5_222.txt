• MS - Mass Spectrometer
• Molecular ion —The ionized molecule, unfragmented, which when
detected, provides the molecular weight of the molecule.
t "Most probable" -This term refers to the confidence in a com-
pound identification based upon all chemical and spectroscopic
information known about the sample.
Sample Handling and Preservation
These samples are usually found as residues in aluminum dishes, from which
extraction and separation solvents have been removed, along with water, by
evaporation and desiccation. On some occasions, the residue is somewhat fluid
due to a rather nonvolatile liquid being present. These samples should be
stored in a refrigerator when not being used. All dishes and implements must
be carefully washed in warm soapy water, rinsed several times with water,
rinsed in pure organic solvents such as hexane, acetone, or methylene chloride
and dried. Contact of the sample with hands, fingers and other sources of out-
side contamination must be avoided.
Apparatus
Finnigan-Model 4023 Automated GC/MS
Several other quadrupole or magnetic sector MS instruments, automated or
manual, are available to perform this analysis. Minimum requirements are:
• Resolution of at least 1000 over the 40 to 1000 AMU range.
• A solid inlet system.
• A batch inlet system for liquid samples. (This can be the
gas chromatograph.)
• Variable ionization voltages from zero to at least 70 eV.

Supplies of the following solvents, Pesticide Grade, Distilled-in-Glass ,
or equivalent should be kept in 1- or 2-liter quantities. These solvents will
be used to solubilize the residues as required for homogenization of the sample
and its placement in the solid probe capillary, The choice of the proper
