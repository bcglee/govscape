At high combustion efficiencies, only traces of CO, hydrocarbons, and waste
will be present in the combustion effluent and can be ignored as contributors
to the combustion effluent flow rate.
The dry volumetric flow rate for W metric tons per hour of herbicide and
3
A m per hour air feed is derived from stoichiometry as follows:
0 The moles of combustion product formed (dry basis) are
moles product = moles C0 + moles HCA + moles 0 + moles N

• The combustion of 100 grams of herbicide will produce
C/12,011 moles C0

Ct/35.453 moles HU
1/2 (H/1.008 - CA/35.453) moles H 0

• If there are 0/32 moles of oxygen present in the herbicide,
then the stoichiometric requirement for oxygen from the air
feed is
S =,C/12.011 + 1/4 (H/1.008 - C£/35.453) - 0/32 moles)/
(1)
100 g herbicide
t If the combustion effluent contains an excess of air Y% over
the stoichiometric requirement, the moles of oxygen in the
combustion effluent are:
S x Y/100 moles 0 /100 g herbicide (2)

• The nitrogen content of the product gas follows directly from
the composition of feed air, i.e.,
0.7809S/0.2095 moles N from oxygen requirement

and
0.7809S Y/(0.2095 x 100) moles N present in the excess air
