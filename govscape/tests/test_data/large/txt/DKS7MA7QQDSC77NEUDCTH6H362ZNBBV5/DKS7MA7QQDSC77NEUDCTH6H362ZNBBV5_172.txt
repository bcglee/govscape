that in the rat, rabbit, calf and chicken, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T had a biological
half-life varying from three to twelve hours and that urinary excretion was the
most common route of elimination. Data exist to indicate that only very small
amounts of 2,4-D are metabolized by the rabbit (Clark e_t aK, 1964; Kahnna and
Fang, 1966). Berndt and Koschier (1973) studied the in vitro uptake of 2,4-D
and 2,4,5-T.by the renal cortical tissue of rabbits and rats. Renal cortical
slices from both species accumulate 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T with greater uptake occur-
ring in rabbit tissue. Nitrogen and various metabolic inhibitors reduced the
uptake thus indicating that both of these organic acid herbicides are trans-
ported by the renal organic anion mechanism. Berndt and Koschier (1973) con-
cluded that renal tubular transport by the organic anion mechanism may account
for the relatively rapid disappearance of these compounds and this may account
for their low toxicity.
(2) Absorption and Distribution: The most common route of acci-
dental absorption of chlorophenoxy herbicide in terrestrial animals is via
ingestion. This is especially true in herbivores. However, absorption of toxic
doses via inhalation and cutaneous routes is possible, if uncommon. The liter-
ature indicates that gastric absorption of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and their amines
and alkali salts occur readily as would be predicted from classical Henderson-
Hasselbalch relationships. However, the gastro-intestinal absorption of 2,4-D
in the form of an ester may be incomplete. Erne (1966) administered 2,4-D ester
orally and found no detectable esters in the plasma. However, detection of low
levels of 2,4-D in the plasma indicated that some hydrolysis of the ester had
occurred. Erne (1966) in studies with rats, calves, chickens, and pigs found
that the highest tissue levels of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were found in liver,, kidney,
lung and spleen, the levels sometimes exceeding the plasma level. In blood
cells, 10-20% of the plasma level was found. Penetration of 2,4-D into adipose
tissue and into the central nervous system was restricted, whereas a ready pla-
cental transfer was demonstrated in swine. The distribution pattern did not
show any significant species or - in rats - sex differences. Klingman et al.
(1966) measured ppb amounts of 2,4-D in the milk from cows grazing on pasture
probably sprayed with esters of 2,4-D. However, these levels dropped to unde-
tectable amounts (<1 ppb) on the third day after the pasture had been sprayed.
