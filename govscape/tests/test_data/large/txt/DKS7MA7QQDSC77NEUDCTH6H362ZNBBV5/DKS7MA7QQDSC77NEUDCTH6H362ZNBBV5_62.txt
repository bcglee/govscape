4. TEST RESULTS
This section presents the results of monitoring, sampling, and analysis
operations on this program. Many of the calculations are complex; therefore,
sample calculations are presented in Appendix F. When an example calculation
is given, the text is so noted.
4.1 OPERATIONAL AND FIELD DATA
Data acquired onboard the ship during the three burn periods included
on-line gas composition, waste feed rates, and incinerator wall and flame tem-
peratures. Each of these is discussed 1n the following sections.

Signal outputs from the on-line instruments were recorded on strip charts
and, an Esterline-Angus data logging device which automatically printed out the
millivolt signal from each instrument .at 5-minute intervals. Data were acquired
for approximately 29 hours during the first 10-day burn period, and for 17 hours
and 13 hours, respectively, during the second and third burns of 11 days each.
Monitoring times ranged from 1 to 5 hours duration representing random and
preselected day and night monitoring. Daylight monitoring was normally coor-
dinated with stack sampling activities so that on-line data may be compared to
results derived from the analysis of stack gas samples. During the on-line
monitoring, the data were continuously evaluated and assessed daily to deter-
mine compliance with combustion efficiency, temperature, and excess air require-
ments specified in the permit.
Results of the gas composition analyses for each burn, shown in Tables 13,
14 and 15, were calculated on a dry basis, i.e., the samples were water-free
when analyzed and no correction has been made for removed moisture. Oxygen
values have been corrected for the volumes of COg and HC1 which were removed
from the oxygen analyzer sample feed before analysis by a scrubber installed
to protect the instrument. The range of levels for each species shows the
