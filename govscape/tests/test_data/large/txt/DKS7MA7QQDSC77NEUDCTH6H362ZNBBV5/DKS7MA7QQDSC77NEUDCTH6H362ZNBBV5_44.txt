• Additional large capacity (2-liter) impingers were added to
the train to permit sampling for 4 hours without having to
replace the NaOH acid scrubbing impingers or to remove the
excess moisture trapped in the impingers.
• Because the sorbent material has poor trapping efficiency for
low molecular weight, high volatility organic species in the
GI to GS range, it was necessary to supplement the organic
sorbent trap sample. An integrated, composite grab gas sam-
ple was taken utilizing 28-liter Tedlar® gas sample bags.
The gas sample was taken at the Beckman gas conditioner (Fig-
ure 6) which minimized sample alteration and facilitated the
sampling operation.
The sorbent trap train used during this program has been tested extensively
for trapping organic compounds in general^ ' and organochlorine compounds in
(4 51
particular. '' Prior to incinerating Herbicide Orange, Arthur D. Little, Inc.,
tested the sorbent trap with TCDD and found an average recovery efficiency of
(3\
65%.v ' TRW tested the sorbent trap train with TCDD and found an average col-
lection/recovery efficiency of 62%. The TRW tests are described in detail in
Appendix E.
After test completion, the various samples were taken and preserved as
follows:
• The probe and the heat traced Teflon ® sample line between the
probe and the sorbent trap/impinger portion of the sampling
trains were cleaned between tests by rinsing with acetone. -...
The rinsings and any dislodged particulate were saved and
n
stored in a cool place in amber glass bottles with Teflon® -
lined caps, these rinses were apportioned on Johnston Island
according to the gas volumes sampled by the respective trains.
• The solid sorbent trap was removed from the train, capped, .
and stored prior to shipment to TRW by the U.S. Air Force.
