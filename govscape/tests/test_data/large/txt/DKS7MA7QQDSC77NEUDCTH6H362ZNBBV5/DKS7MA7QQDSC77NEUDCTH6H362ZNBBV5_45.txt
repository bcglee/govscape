t The total volume of liquid in the impingers was measured
to determine moisture corrections for sampled gas volume.
3.2 TEST COMMENTARY AND PROBLEMS
3.2.1 First Burn Commentary and Problems
The Vulcanus arrived at Johnston Island on the morning of 11 July 1977.
For the next 3.days the ship was outfitted with the sampling probes, lines and
other equipment. Part of the outfitting had been accomplished on land prior to
the arrival of the Vulcanus. In particular, the instruments had been checked
out and calibrated. When the ship arrived, the storage container was removed
from the ship and emptied of the probe, A-frame probe support, gas cylinders,
and other equipment. The storage container was then reloaded and the portable
laboratory placed on top. Both containers were then lashed to the deck. A
servicing platform was built below the probe support, and a walkway was con-
structed from the ship's central catwalk to the portable laboratory.
On 13 July the Vulcanus left port for the burn site and arrived early on
14 July. Pre-incineration plankton tows were performed, as described in Sec-
tion 3.3. The incinerators were then heated with fuel oil. Once flame tem-
peratures reached 1280°C, a fuel oil background test was started. Upon comple-
tion, burner changeover to Herbicide Orange was started at 1540 hours on
14 July. Incineration of the first shipload was completed at 0225 hours on
24 July. Post-incineration plankton tows were performed. The Vulcanus returned
to Johnston Island on 25 July.
The weather was pleasant, the seas reasonably calm, and the wind was steady
at 9 to 12 m/sec (18 to 24 knots). The incinerator plume was not visible except
when ammonia was injected at the tops of the incinerators. A series of photo-
graphs were taken by the U.S. Navy during a flyover mission.
Generally, the sampling went smoothly, especially after the first two runs
were completed. By that time, most of the minor problems and procedural diffi-
culties had been eliminated. A persistent problem was the difficulty in attain-
ing effluent sample gas outlet temperatures above 100° C in the traversing probe.
Thermocouples and flow rates were checked to eliminate any faulty readings. It
was finally determined that because the probe was designed for a 5 cfm gas flow,
the low (0.8 to 1 cfm) flow rates exceeded the temperature control design.
