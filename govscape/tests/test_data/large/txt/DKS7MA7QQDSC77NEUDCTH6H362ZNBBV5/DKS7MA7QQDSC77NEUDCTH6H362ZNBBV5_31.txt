reset to the required automatic shutoff temperature before the system activated.
The ability to record temperatures in this manner was useful in the event that
the indicator wall temperature thermocouple should fail during operation.
2.4.4 Special Equipment
Certain equipment has been installed on the Vulcanus because of its partic-
ular type of operation. These items of equipment are:
• Lpran and DeccaNavigational Systems: This equipment is needed
in American (Loran) ana" European (Decca) waters in order to
locate the ship precisely at all times. Celestial navigation
was used to locate and keep the Vulcanus in the designated
burn zone.
• Anemometer: This equipment measures the velocity and force
of the wind. It is, therefore, useful in selecting an atti-
tude of the ship during various wind conditions such that the
plume may be directed away from the ship and its personnel,
• Radio Commun ication: The Vulcanus is equipped with SSB (single
si'de bandj and DSB (double side band) radio for voice and contin-
uous wave communication; MF (medium frequency) and SF (short
wave) telegraphy; Marifoon (VHF) (all channels) for close-in
voice,communication; and Semafoon (a private telephonic communi-
cation system). For this program, a Hagenuck Synthesized Trans-
ceiver was installed to permit voice communication over all
marine frequencies. A radio was also located on the bridge
so that the watch officer could hear marine broadcasts at all
times.
• Optical Pyrometer: A portable optical pyrometer was utilized
during the test program to measure incinerator flame tempera-
tures. These measurements were taken daily using a Leeds and
Northrup optical pyrometer operating in the 6500 A range.
• Black Box: On the bridge was a panel in a sealable enclosure
referred to as the "black box" which displayed information
necessary to assure that wastes were being burned at proper
temperatures and, in Europe where the Decca Navigator can
receive suitable land based signals, at the proper location.
The panel displays included the following information: indicator
thermocouple readings for each incinerator; day, month, and time;
status (on/off) of the waste pumps; and the vessel's position
by the Decca Navigator. An 8 mm movie camera within the black
box photographed the panel every 15 minutes during incinerator
operations. Films from the incineration of Herbicide Orange
were retained by the U.S. EPA.
