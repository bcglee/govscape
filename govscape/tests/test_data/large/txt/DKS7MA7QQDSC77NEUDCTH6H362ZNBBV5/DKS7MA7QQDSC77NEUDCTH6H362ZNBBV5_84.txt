^Indicates nothing was detected in that range. The column labeled Detection Limit shows the amount of material which could have been present
without being detected. The pluses were used to highlight what was found rather than what was not found, since most of the entries wooId be less
than values. The detection limit for these analyses was 0.7 ng/p I injected.
