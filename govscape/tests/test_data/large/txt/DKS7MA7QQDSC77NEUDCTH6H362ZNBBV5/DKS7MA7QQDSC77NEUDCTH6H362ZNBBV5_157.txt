The need for personal cleanliness is pointed up by the methods of entry
of TCDD into the body. These are:
• Through the mouth (ingestion)
• Through the skin (percutaneous)
• Through the lungs and eyes
Thus, eating, drinking, and smoking in working areas; wearing contaminated
clothes; leaving liquids on the skin, failure to shower frequently and, espe-
cially, immediately after exposure; and breathing contaminated air must be
avoided.
Discussions have been held with Col. Walter W. Melvin, Jr., M.D., USAF
Environmental Health Laboratory, Kelly AFB, Texas, and Dr. V.K. Rowe, Corporate
Offices, Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Michigan, concerning methods of personnel
hygiene. They concur with the concepts of personal cleanliness, isolation of
contaminated areas, and preservation of "clean" areas which are described
herein.
Most procedures designed to protect personnel from hazards are a compro-
mise between the ideal of complete avoidance of exposure and the reality of.
providing safe conditions and areas in which work can be done.
In the present case, good personal hygiene practices are of prime impor-
tance in preventing exposure of personnel to materials containing TCDD. Of
equal importance is the establishment of "clean" areas, in which personnel can
co-exist normally; the isolation of the hazard in areas where contamination is
expected and can be dealt with; and the maintenance of an interface between
the two areas which can be crossed while maintaining the integrity of the clean
area and the safety of personnel therein.
It is anticipated that the first opportunity for exposure will come from
spills and leaks in the system. The exposed liquids will evaporate, especially
from hot decks and tankage areas below decks, and the very hot combustor room.
The liquids may be tracked over the decks and passageways, and may find
their way into the eating and living quarters unless an inviolate interface is
established between the two areas.
