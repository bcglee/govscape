The incineration permits required that during startup (1) Herbicide
Orange:could not be fed until flame temperatures had reached 1280°C, (2)
only one burner at a time could be switched from fuel oil to herbicide, and
(3) flame temperatures of 1280°C had to be reached before the next burner was
changed to herbicide. During the startup period of each burn, flame tempera-
tures were measured with the optical pyrometer. Flame temperatures were always
in excess of 1280°C as the burners were changed one-by-one to herbicide.
Based on the elemental composition of the waste (Table 8} and an average
feed rate of 7.3 metric tons per hour per incinerator, the average emission
rates of major stack gas components from each incinerator were calculated
(Appendix F.3) to be:
C0 6,690 m3/hr
2
HC1 1,378 m3/hr
0 5,781 m3/hr
2
N 47,150 m3/hr
2
H 0 4,839 m3/hr
2
for a total average combustion effluent flow rate of 65,838 m3/hr at 0°C.
