1. PROBE AND LINE RINSE APPORTIONMENT
For the test of 7/16/77, the Lear-Siegler train sampled 6.0914 m3. The
benzene impinger train took three samples, one for WSU of 0.1179 m0, one for
TRW of 0.1209 m3, and one for BCL/USAF of 0.1211 m3. These four samples
o
totaled 6.4513 m . Each sample represents the following fraction of the total.
• Lear-Siegler - 94.42%
t WSU impinger - 1.83%
• TRW impinger - 1.87%
• BCL/USAF impinger - 1.1
To apportion the line rinses properly to each sample, the total line rinse
volume of 2320 ml was multiplied by the fraction of gas taken in each sample.
Thus, 94.42% of 2320 ml is 2191 ml.
The probe rinse split was complicated by the fact that three days of test-
ing were performed before rinsing the probe. Thus 330 ml of probe rinse was

obtained and a total of 17,2883 m of gas had been sampled (tests of 14, 15,
and 16 July). The Lear-Siegler train sample of 7/16 was 6.0914 m3 or 35.23%
of 17.2883 m3, and 35.23% of the 330 ml probe rinse was 116 ml.

2.1 Volume Percent.HC1 in Combustion Effluent
From the data given in Table 13 for test day 2, the volume percent HC1 is
