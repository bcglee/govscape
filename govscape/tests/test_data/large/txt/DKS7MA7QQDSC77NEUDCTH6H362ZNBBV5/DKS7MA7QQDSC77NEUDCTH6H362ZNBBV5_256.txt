8. EMISSION CONCENTRATIONS OF 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, AND TCDD AT
0% DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCY
For the test of 7/16/77, the waste feed rate was 7.03 metric tons per hour
per incinerator (Table 17). From the on-line monitoring instruments, the con-
centrations of 02 and C0 were measured (Table 13) at 8.4% and 10.5%, respec-

tively. The effluent flow rate was calculated to be 60,900 dry rn3/hr at 20°C
from the following equations. Per metric ton of herbicide per hour

If the destruction efficiency for 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T were zero, then the
emission concentration of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T would be:
7.03 X 103 kg/hr X 103 g/kg X (1/60,900 m3/hr) * 115 g/m3
The TCDD concentration in the composite feed sample of 7/16/77 was deter-
mined to be (Table 38) E.5 pg/ml. If the destruction efficiency for TCDD were
zero, then the emission concentration of TCDD would be:
7.03 mt/hr x 106 g/mt x 2.5 pg/mjt x (1/1.17 g/mi) x (1/60,900 m3/hr)
