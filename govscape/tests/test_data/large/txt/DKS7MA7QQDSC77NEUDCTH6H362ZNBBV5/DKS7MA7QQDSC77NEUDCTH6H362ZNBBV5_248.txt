The samples from the tests (sorbent trap extract, the apparatus rinses,
and the two benzene impingers) were reduced in volume to 2 ml using Kuderna-
Danish concentrators.
5. ANALYSIS
The concentrated samples (and blanks) from the tests were analyzed using
a Finnigan 4000 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The analytical and oper-
aattiinngg ppaa1rameters were similar to these recommended by WSU and were as
follows:
0 GG column: 6-ft X 2-mrn ID glass column, 3% OV-101 on
100/120 rnesh Gas Chrom Q R
• Carrier gas: helium at 50 ml/min
• Column temperature: 180°C
• Injector: 300°
• Jet separator: 275°C
• Filament current: 0.2 mA
t Multiplier voltage: 200V
, t Analyzer pressure: 1^3 X 10 torr
The m/e 322 ion was monitored and used for quantisation. Calibration
standards were the same as used for the tests.
6. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The results of the analyses are given in Table E-l. On the basis of these
results;an average minimum efficiency of the sorbent trap for collecting and
releasing TCDD is calculated to be 62%.
In a report by A.D. Little, Inc.,v ' the sorbent trap was tested by adding
TCDD standards directly into the sorbent resin rather than by vaporizing the
TCDD and passing the vapor into the trap. Their average recovery was 65%.
