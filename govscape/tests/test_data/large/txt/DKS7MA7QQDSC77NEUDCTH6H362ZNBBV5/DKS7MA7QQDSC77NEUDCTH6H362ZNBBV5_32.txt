3. TEST OPERATIONS
3.1 SAMPLING AND,MONITORING EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES
The combustion product effluent stream from the incineration of Herbicide
Orange onboard the M/T Vuleanus was sampled utilizing three probes. Two ceramic
probes (one in each stack) were installed to divert the gases to an on-line mon-
itoring system comprised of CO, COg, Og» and hydrocarbon analyzers. For a more
comprehensive characterization of the combustion effluent chemical species,
including specific herbicide constituents, a water-cooled probe capable of
traversing the starboard incinerator diverted a representative portion of the
effluent stream to two sampling trains. These sampling trains were: (1) the
USAF-OEHL benzene impinger train which was previously tested and proven effec-
tive for sampling 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and TCDD, and (2) a modified U.S. EPA Method
;5.train which incorporated a sorbent trap that has been used extensively for
the general trapping of organic compounds in commercial incineration of
organochlorines. The USAF train was the primary train for acquiring the sam-
ples for TCOD analysis, whereas the sorbent train acted as a backup system for
TCDD, as well as the primary train for the determination of organic species
potentially present in the effluent.
In addition to stack sampling, a variety of air, liquid, and solid samples
were taken. These samples included:
0 Plankton and seawater samples - Plankton and seawater tows were
made in the burn zone before and after incineration of the first
shipload.
• Tedlar®_ bag stack gas grab sample? - Samples of the stack
gas obtained from the gas conditioner were taken to supple-
ment the XAD-2® module information. Each sample was
28 liters in volume.
• Burner residues - Samples of burner residue were taken when
the burners were cleaned.
