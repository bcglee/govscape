Results of wipe sample analyses for the first, second, and third burns are
given in Tables 44, 45, and 46, respectively. Figure 17 shows locations where
wipe samples were taken. Results are discussed in Section 5.3.1.
4.2.9.2 Analyses of Combustion Effluent Benzene Impinger Samples
After each test, the TRW benzene impinger was analyzed onboard the M/T
Vulcanus for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Neither 2,4-D nor 2,4,5-T was detected in any
of the benzene impinger samples. Results of these analyses were reported
immediately by radio to Johnston Island for transmission to U.S. EPA.
4.2.9.3 Analyses of Air Samples
Samples of workspace air were taken by 10-ml gas sampling syringes for
analysis of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. None of the air samples showed the presence of
these compounds.
4.3 DISCUSSION OF ON-LINE INSTRUMENTATION
4.3.1 Applicability to ComplianceDetermination
The on-line instrumentation package installed on the M/T Vulcanus for this
effort was originally assembled and used for the same purpose during a series
of six land-based incinerator test programs to destroy 12 industrial wastes.
In addition, essentially the same instrumentation was used on the M/T Vulcanus
during at-saa incineration of organochlorine waste in the Gulf of Mexico under
Special Permit No. 750D008E. ' In each test program, incinerator effluent
gas-es were monitored by on-line instrumentation for concentrations of C0 , CO,
2
hydrocarbons, and Og.
The concentration of CO in combustion effluent gas is of particular impor-
tance because it is a good indicator of the efficiency of the combustion proc-
ess. Combustion efficiency values are readily calculated from C0 and CO meas-
2
urements. This approach to compliance determination has several advantages.
It is real-time, continuous, rapid, and calculations are readily performed.
Most importantly, using on-line instrumentation makes compliance determination
waste-independent. Therefore, sampling and analysis plans do not have to be
designed for each type of waste burned. Further, one need not know waste
feed rates to an incinerator to be able to calculate combustion efficiency.
For example, if one were measuring chlorinated compounds in the effluent from
