greatly. For example, the 96-hour Tl_ * for fathead minnows exposed to DMA-
50
2,4-D was found to be 335 mg/1, Yet, for bluegills and channel catfish the
TL Q values were 177 and 193 respectively. A temperature increase from 17°C
5
to 20°C increased the relative toxicity to the catfish from TUn of 193 mg/1
to 125 mg/1 (Schultz, 1973),
(b) Toxicity Compari sons by EHl(K): The USAF EHL(K) (1974),
performed static toxicity studies with Orange herbicide. Also, toxicity studies
were performed using each individual N-butyl ester of 2,4-0 and 2,4,5-T.
Freshwater bioassays using the fathead minnow (Pimephales. promelas) resulted in
a 48 hr LC of 3.4 ppra for Orange herbicide containing 14 ppm TCDD. The
5Q
48 hr LCggS for esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were 2.8 ppm and 5 ppm respectively.
The 48 hr LC for 2,4-D in the minnows was 270 ppm. The 2,4,5-T 48 hr LC
5Q 5Q
concentration was 333 pptn. Note that the toxicity of ester formulations were
considerably more toxic than the respective acid. Also, EHL{K) found the
N-butyl ester of 2,4-D to be more toxic than the N-butyl ester of 2,4,5-T. In
saltwater studies by EHL(K), the 48 hr LC * values in the shrimp (Penaeus sp.)
5Q
were 5.6 ppm for 2,4-D NBE and 33 ppm for 2,4,5-T NBE. Oysters (Crassostrea
virgim'ca) were exposed to "potential concentrations" of 2,4-D NBE ranging from
0.5 ppm to 85 ppm. The only acute effect observed was the death of one of the
oyster (10%) in the highest concentration at 48 hours.
(c) Other Animals and Other Effects: Many other aquatic
animals besides fish can be affected by phenoxy herbicides. Saunders (1971)
studied the effects of the propylene glycol butyl ether ester (PGBE) of 2,4-D
on six freshwater crusteceans. He found the following 48 hr TlgQ* values:
Daphnia magna 3 0.10 ppm, seed shrimp « 0.32 ppm, scud = 2.6 ppm, sowbug =
2.2 ppm, glass shrimp = 2.7 ppm, and crayfish had an unknown value larger than
100 ppm. Cope (1970) studied the chronic effects of PGBE ester of 2,4-D on the
TL-5Q and LCso (Tolerance Umit and Lethal Concentration) are concentration
values statistically derived from tFe estaFl ishment of a dose-related response
of experimental organisms to a toxicant. The LC is based on a measured
response of death only, the TL is based on a count of unaffected organisms.
The subscript number for both indicates the percent response expected for the
calculated concentration. Therefore, in most cases, the TLso = LCso or the
concentration in which 50% death is expected. Note that a more toxic chemical
has a smaller LCsQ.
