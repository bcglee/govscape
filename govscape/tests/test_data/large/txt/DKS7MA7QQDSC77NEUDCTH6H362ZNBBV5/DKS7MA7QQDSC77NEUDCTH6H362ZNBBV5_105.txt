and de^ctor lines had; glass inserts. One unit was used as the primary analy-
sis instrument; the other unit was held in reserve.
In order to provide power as free as possible from noise transients, the
GC, recorder, and data processor were run off a Shimadzu-supplied transformer
to step down the 120V, 60 Hz motor generator power to 100V, 60 Hz.
All onboard analyses were performed isothermally at 170°C. The carrier
gas was nitrogen at 30 ml/min. Electron capture was the means of detection.
Under these conditions, an analysis required 20 minutes.
4.2.9.1 Analyses of Wipe. Samples '
Wipe samples were taken daily throughout incineration operations to monitor
and determine the effectiveness of the boundary exclusion method of controlling
Herbicide Orange contamination. These samples were taken by gently rubbing an
approximately 1 m 2 area of surface, e.g., deck, wall, floor, with a Whatman 41(F?)W
filter paper disc. The discs were extracted by soaking in 5 ml of benzene for
30 minutes, and the extracts were then analyzed using the onboard GC. Because
of space and time limitations, wipes could not be extracted exhaustively, as in
a soxhlet extractor. Therefore, the efficiency of extraction of 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T from the wipes was not known.
• Standards of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were obtained from the U.S. EPA. A sample
of waste was also used to prepare a standard. There were four major peaks in
the U.S. EPA-derived working standards; the waste-derived standard contained
corresponding peaks. The presence of all four peaks was required to confirm
the presence of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in a wipe sample. Because of the unknown
extraction efficiency, results of the wipe sample analyses are given as positive
{herbicide present) or negative (herbicide absent).
Wipe samples were taken in Gulfport, MI, before and after herbicide was
loaded. These wipes served as a background to permit the analysts to distin-
guish the contribution of previous wastes and ship's lubricants to the chromato-
grams from 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Results of the background wipe samples are given
in Table 43. All of the pre- and post-loading wipe samples were negative for
2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
