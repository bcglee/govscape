6. WASTE DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCIES AND EMISSIONS ASSESSMENT
6.1 WASTE DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCIES
Results of analyses for 2.4-D and 2,4,5-T in the Lear-Siegler train samples
are given in Table 30. Results of analyses by BCL for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in the
benzene impinger train samples are given in Table 41. WSU analysis results for
TCDD in the benzene impinger train samples are given in Table 38. These analy-
tical results are expressed,in terms of emission concentrations, e.g., ug/m .
The usual engineering method of calculating destruction efficiencies is in
terms of rates,
nr * inn v rate fed - rate emitted
ut xuu x —rn
rat@ fed
Instead of recalculating analytically determined emission concentrations as
emission rates,.herbicide feed rates were converted to emission concentrations
for destruction efficiency calculations. Converting herbicide (or TCDD) feed
rates to emission concentrations was done by (1) calculating combustion efflu-
ent flow rates from combustion stoichiometry, on-line monitoring data, and her-
bicide (or TCDD) feed rates as illustrated in Appendix F.2 and (2) dividing
herbicide (or TCDD) feed rates by combustion effluent flow rates as illustrated
in Appendix F.8. These values for maximum herbicide (or TCDD) emission concen-
trations are termed emission concentrations at 0% destruction efficiency.
Table 49 gives maximum emission concentrations at 0% destruction efficiency
for 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T and TCDD, waste feed rates, and combustion effluent flow
rates. A sample calculation is given in Appendix F-10. Destruction efficiencies
were calculated from:
