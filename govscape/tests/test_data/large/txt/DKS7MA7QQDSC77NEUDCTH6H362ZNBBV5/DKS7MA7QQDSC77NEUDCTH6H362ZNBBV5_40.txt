The position of the port in the starboard stack used for inserting the
water-cooled probe is shown in Figure 11, which also shows the locations of the
two ceramic,probes. The port for the water-cooled probe was located about
7.6 m above the plane of the burners, about 0.9 rn below the top of the stack,
and directly above burner No. 6, so that the traverse diameter was at a
6-degree angle with respect to the centerline of the k-eel.
Ten sampling points were located along the traverse diameter according to
U.S. EPA Method 1. These points are shown in Figure 12. Because the probe
support I-beam had been extended 1 meter to allow full withdrawal of the probe
from the stack, the last two points could not be reached. The overall sampling
time was about 4 hours, or 30 minutes at each of the eight points that were
accessible.
3.1.2.2 USAF Benzene Impinger Train
The Air Force benzene impinger train apparatus was developed for previous
i?\
incineration tests of Herbicide Orange in 1973V '. Equipment and sampling tech-
niques were validated in a test program based upon mass balance of known herbi-
cide constituents fed to this sampling train versus the amount found.
The sampling system used to monitor emissions of herbicide components and
TCDD was a modified version of the one described in Appendix E of Reference 2.
The modification was the insertion of a 15 m heated Teflon® line with temper-
ature monitor, six Greenburg-Smith impingers, a pump and a dry gas meter. Fig*
ure 13 is a schematic of the system. The first two impingers were modified
Greenburg-Smith with a coarse quartz frit added to the end of the nozzle.
These impingers were filled with 350 ml of benzene. The next two impingers,
with the Greenburg-Smith type impactor nozzle removed, were 2/3 filled with
activated charcoal. The fifth impinger contained 240 ml of 30% (w/v) NaOH
to absorb HC1, and the last impinger contained silica gel which was used to
remove H«0 from the gas stream.
The system operated at a flow rate of 2 to 3 liters per minute. Sampling
began after the incinerator reached equilibrium while incinerating Herbicide
