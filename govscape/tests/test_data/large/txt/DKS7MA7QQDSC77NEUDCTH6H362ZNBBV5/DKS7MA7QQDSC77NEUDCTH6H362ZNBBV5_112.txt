burning an"organochlorine waste, It would be necessary to know the waste feed
rate in order to calculate an incineration destruction efficiency.
In addition to on-line monitoring during these test programs, samples of
all process streams, such as combustion effluent, incinerator ash, feed stocks,
and scrubber effluent, were acquired for laboratory analysis. Results of these
analyses were used to calculate destruction efficiencies for specific waste
components. Table 47 presents a comparison of combustion and destruction effi-
ciencies determined on both land based and at-sea incineration tests. The
results in Table 47 indicate that combustion efficiency compared well with waste
destruction efficiency. In those cases where a destruction efficiency was lower
than the corresponding combustion efficiency, waste constituents were found in
incinerator ash, and destruction efficiencies based on combustion effluent anal-
yses only were higher than those given in the table.
For the Gulf of Mexico tests on the M/T Vulcanus/ ' a special moveable,
water-cooled, stainless steel jacketed probe with a quartz liner was developed.
This probe traversed the starboard incinerator stack and conducted the combus-
tion effluent gas to both the SASS stack sampling train and the on-line instru-
mentation. Analysis of on-line moni.toring data led to the important conclusion
that a.fixed-position probe drawing sample gas from a single point in the stack
would have served to measure the effluent gas composition and incinerator com-
bustion efficiency. At probe insertion depths greater than 15 cm past the inner
wall of the stack, wall effects were negligible, and all calculated combustion
efficiencies were greater than 99.9%.
For the Herbicide Orange incineration tests, a fixed-position alumina
probe was placed approximately 38 cm (15 in.) past the inner wall of each incin-
erator stack, and the moveable probe was again placed in the starboard stack.
The moveable probe conducted combustion effluent to the sampling trains, while
the fixed-position probes conducted combustion effluent gas samples to the
on-line monitors. One test was performed with the moveable probe connected to
the on-line monitors so that combustion efficiency could be measured as a func-
tion of distance across the stack. The results of this test are given in
Figure 15 and show that at insertion depths greater than 10 cm combustion
efficiencies were essentially invariant and exceeded 99.991%.
