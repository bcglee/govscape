1. INTRODUCTION
The TRW analyses of samples acquired during the incineration of Herbicide
Orange were intended to characterize the environmental acceptability of the
incineration. The analytical plan discussed below is basically a Level I
organic analysis. It is intended to provide quantitative information on emis-
sions of classes of organic compounds so that important emissions do not go
undetected and to provide information on the destruction efficiency of the
incineration. Full documentation of Level I sampling and analysis is found in;
t "Level I Environmental Assessment," IERL Procedures Manual,
Document No. EPA-60012-76-16Qa.
• "Combustion Source Assessment: Method and Procedures Manual
for Sampling and Analysis," Draft Report to EPA-IERL-RTP,
January 1977.
An overview of the methodology used for the Level I organic analyses is
shown in Figure 16. This methodology deals with the preparation of the sam-
ples to provide forms suitable for analysis and with the subsequent analyses.
As indicated in this Figure, the extent of sample preparation required
varies with sample type. The low molecular weight hydrocarbons, boiling at
£90°C and reported as C1-C6 n-alkanes, are determined by gas chromatography
and require no preparation. Organic liquids, such as fuel oil, also require
no preparation and are placed directly into the analysis scheme. Other sam-
ples, such as the sorbent trap and burner residue, will require preparation
by solvent extraction prior to analysis. Solvent extraction will separate
the organic from the inorganic portions of the samples so that analysis can
proceed without complications.
