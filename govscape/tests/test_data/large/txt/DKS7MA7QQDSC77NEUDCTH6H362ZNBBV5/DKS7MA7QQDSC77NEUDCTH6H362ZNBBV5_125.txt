impacted the port side of the ship for approximately 30 to 60 seconds. Because
a porthole was open to the TRW quarters on the port side, the plume could have
entered this living area. Wipe and syringe samples were taken from the TRW
quarters and on the port side of the ship to determine the extent of contami-
nation from the white plume. The syringe sample taken from the TRW quarters
was negative for Herbicide Orange. Wipe samples were taken from the porthole
sill and on areas just below and to either side of the porthole (the face of
the refrigerator and the headboard of a bunk). The wipe taken from the port-
hole sill showed the presence of herbicide, all other areas tested negative.
Decontamination was initiated by using high pressure saltwater to hose down
the port companionway. The porthole sill in the TRW quarters was wiped with
acetone and water. After decontamination, a wipe sample taken from the port-
hole sill showed no evidence of herbicide.
The second incident occurred at 4:20 a.m. on 21 July. A TRW team member
was awakened by the odor of Herbicide Orange in the TRW quarters on the port
side. The odor was immediately eliminated by opening the door to the galley
which resulted in cross ventilation starboard to port. This incident was very
brief and it is not clear whether it was caused by a momentary flameout or
from the pump room vent.
A third incident occurred at 7:22 a.m. on 21 July as the result of a flame-
out. An oil-like fog was ejected from both stacks. The plume impinged on the
port side of the ship and lasted about 15 to 20 seconds before a tank switch-
over was made by the ship's crew. The cause was traced to an aqueous layer
floating on the top of the Herbicide Orange. Because of this incident, it was
requested that the ship's officer put the ship underway just prior to emptying
a tank. Wipe samples were taken, and the ship's crew repeated the hose-down of
all affected areas on the port side. Samples that were taken proved to be neg-
ative, and a complete decontamination of the living area was not initiated.
The final flameout occurred at 2:55 a.m. on 23 July. This flameout was
of very short duration (perhaps 5 seconds) and did not leave any measurable
contamination on the ship.
All personnel onboard the Vulcanus were referred to the dispensary on
Johnston Island at the end of the first burn. No effects were found.
