structurally sound for stacking. The portable laboratory was stacked above an
identical container/which was used for storage of supplies and spares. The
stacking arrangement on the ship met U.S. Coast Guard requirements. Figure 6
gives a view of the 'equipment arrangement in the portable laboratory.
Power for the portable laboratory and sampling equipment was provided by
a motor generator which converted the 440 V, 60 Hz ship's power to 110 V, 60 Hz.
This motor generator was installed on the observation deck, above the bridge. A
backup motor generator was similarly installed.
3.1.1.1 Fixed Probe Design
The probe used for the on-line gas analyzers was in addition to the sampling
equipment previously used on the Vulcanus. The probe was a 122- by 1.27-cm OD
high temperature alumina tube with a 1.6 mm wall. This ceramic material was
inert and had been shown to operate well in similar environments. It required
no cooling and was fixed in place (i.e., it would not traverse). One of these
probes was installed in each incinerator stack and extended about 38 cm (IS in.)
past the inner wall. Heat traced TeflonÂ® lines connected these probes to a
three-way valve. This valve was connected to a manifold in the portable labora-
tory leading, to two parallel gas analysis systems. Figure 7 is a schematic of
the probe and heat traced line layout. This design made it possible to monitor
either incinerator with either gas analysis system although both incinerators
could not be monitored simultaneously.
3.1.1.2 Instrumentation
On-line monitoring of the concentrations of selected gases in both inciner-
ator effluents was accomplished by two complete duplicate systems schematically
depicted in Figure 8. These measurements served as indices of the effectiveness
of the thermal destruction process. The on-line monitors used one ceramic probe
in each stack with heated line delivery systems. This allowed random monitoring
of the incinerators regardless of the status of the other trains. The monitors
and their calibration ranges are shown in Table 4. The manifold system was
designed so that either a complete bank of instruments or one instrument can be
operated depending on the operational readiness of any given instrument.
Besides availability of duplicate analyzers, spare parts were carried onboard.
