effluent. The Lear^-Siegler train also served as a backup to the USAF-OEHL train.
These stack samples were subsequently analyzed to determine how effectively the
incineration process destroyed constituents of the waste. Stack samples were
acquired by a remotely activated, water-cooled, stainless steel probe capable
of traversing the starboard stack diameter of 3.4 meters.
During stack sampling operations, incineration effluent products were
simultaneously monitored for total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon diox-
ide, and oxygen. Concentrations of these species were measured in real time to
monitor the overall combustion efficiency of the incinerator. Instrumentation
for these measurements was housed in a modified shipping container lashed to
the ship's deck.
