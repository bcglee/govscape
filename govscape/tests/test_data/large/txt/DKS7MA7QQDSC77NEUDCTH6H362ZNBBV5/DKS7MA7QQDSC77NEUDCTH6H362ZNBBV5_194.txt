available. Chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins long have been recognized as
by-products from the manufacture of certain chlorinated phenols, For example,
2,4,5-trichlorophenol is prepared industrially by the hydrolysis of 1,2,4,5-
tetrachlorobenzene at elevated temperatures and pressures, a process which can
also result in the formation of traces of heterocyclic impurities including
2,3,7,3-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin if temperatures are permitted to exceed
160Â°C and if the reaction becomes alkaline. This dioxin is toxic, teratogenic
and acnegenic and its presence appears to account satisfactorily for the
alleged teratogenic effects of trichlorophenol derivatives such as the herbicide
2,4,5-f.
a. Know!edge Avai1able from Use: No proven instance of toxicity asso-
ciated.with 2,4,5-T intake in man has been found in agricultural or industrial
workers known'to have had repeated, relatively high levels of exposure to
2,4,5~T of low dioxin content. The safety factor for the general population is
estimated to be several orders of magnitude greater than that for 2,4,5-T fac-
tory workers. Data are too limited for a firm conclusion, but there is no evi-
dence to suggest that TCDD as a contaminant in 2,4,5-T is likely to be encoun-
tered by animal or man in sufficient dosage to cause toxic reactions (Advisory
Committee, 1971).
. b. Application of Testing: "Since most chemicals under suitable lab-
;
oratory conditions could probably be demonstrated to have teratogenic effects,
and certainly all could be shown to produce some toxic effects if dosage were
raised high enough, it would not be reasonable to consider the demonstration
of toxic effects under conditions of greatly elevated dosage sufficient grounds
for prohibiting further use of a particular chemical," (Goldberg, 1971).
c. Possibility of Pyrolytica'lly Produced Contamjnation: The question
of the formation of TCDD as a result of the pyrolysis or burning of wood,
including brush treated with 2,4,5-T, has been a matter of some concern.
Langer (1973) states, "The derivatives of 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and Silvex as well as
their sodium salts and esters have not produced dioxins in pyrolytic reactions
whether carried out in the solid state, in the melt, or in solution. Even
after conditions of extreme hydrolysis, followed by pyrolysis we could observe
only trace amounts of dioxins." Langer (1973) further stated, "Even extreme
conditions such as burning of treated wood or vegetation after the use of
