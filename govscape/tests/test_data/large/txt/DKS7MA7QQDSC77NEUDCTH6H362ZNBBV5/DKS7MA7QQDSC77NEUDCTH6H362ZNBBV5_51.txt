incinerator'room. A 3 mm ID glass tube, filled with Chromosorb 102Â® for a length
of 25 mm, was attached to each sampler and used to sample air for 2,4-0 and
2,4,5-T analysis. This technique for sampling air for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T had

been previously tested by USAF-OEHL. '
The practical life of a pump battery was 12 hours on one charge. The need
for changing pumps was eliminated by using transformers (220V/110V) so the
pumps could be operated by the ship's power. The monitor in the pump room could
not be operated from a transformer because of maritime regulations. During the
first burn, the tubes were changed every 12 hours. One the second and third
burns the tubes were changed every 24 hours. Selected tubes were analyzed on
Johnston Island after each burn, the remaining tubes have been archived.
3.4.2 Wipe Samples ,
Wipes of selected areas of the ship were made to monitor how effectively
the boundary-isolation plan was keeping herbicide from living areas. Using
fSt
11-cm diameter Whatman 41V filter paper discs, areas about 1 square meter were
wiped. The wipes were extracted with benzene, and the extracts were analyzed
with the onboard gas chromatograph.
3.4.3 Air and Impinger Samples
Workspace air at various positions on the ship was sampled using 10 ml gas
sampling syringes, and analyses were performed with the onboard gas chromato-
graph. In addition, samples of the benzene impingers were analyzed to deter-
mine concentrations of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in the combustion effluent.
3.4.4 Waste Feed Rate
The sealed waste gauging system installed for the Herbicide Orange burns
was not satisfactory for measuring waste feed rates because it gauged only the
top one-third of each tank. In addition, it could not compensate for the ship's
rolling which caused tank contents to slosh. A manual method of gauging tank
contents was also unsatisfactory because it could not compensate for the ship's
rolling.
Waste feed rates were determined, therefore, by measuring the time to
deplete each tank. The volume of each tank was known, and the amount of waste
loaded into each tank was measured after loading. During incineration, the
