Apparatus
1, Steam bath,
2. Kuderna-Danish concentrators consisting of flasks (.125, 250,
and 50 ml), Snyder columns, steel springs, concentrator tubes
(2 ml) and adaptors as needed,
3. Glass beads, 3 mm, plain.
4. Vortex mixer.
5. Disposable Pasteur pipettes.
6. Class A pipette, 2 ml,
7. Volumetric flask, 2 ml, hexagonal base.
Reagents
â€¢ Pentane, distilled-in-glass or Nanograde.
Procedure
1. Select an appropriate size of K-D flask and attach a concentra-
tor tube with the steel springs. Place one 3 mm glass bead in
the bottom of the tube. Label the K-D flask with the sample
code identification.
2. Transfer the sample to the K-D flask. Rinse the sample con-
tainer with three 10 ml portions of the same high purity sol-
vent that the sample is in. Add the rinsings to the K-D flask.
- 3. Attach a Snyder column to the K-D flask and clamp the flask in
position over the steam bath. The solvent should boil at such
a rate that the top ball of the Snyder column bounces lightly.
4. Concentrate the solvent sample to ^5 ml.
5. Remove the K-D assembly from the bath and allow to cool. With
disposable pipette, add ^0.5 ml of the same solvent that the
sample was in to the top of the Snyder column. Allow to drain
into K-D flask and then remove column.
6. Rinse the sides of the K-D flask with another 0.5 ml of solvent.
Remove the flask, stopper the concentrator tube and mix the
tube vigorously on the Vortex mixer for 1 minute.
7. Transfer the contents of the concentrator tube to a 2 ml vol-
umetric flask. Rinse the tube and stopper with 0.5 ml more of
solvent; add these rinsings to the flask and make the flask to
standard volume. Label the flask with the sample code
identification.
