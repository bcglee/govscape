Table 50 presents destruction efficiencies for TCDD calculated from the
WSU analyses. Because TCDD was not detected in most of the samples, the
destruction efficiencies in Table 50 are, in fact, greater than the table
entries as indicated by the ">" character. It should be noted that the
entries for the tests of 8 and 13 August indicate that TCDD destruction effi-
ciencies were greater than 99.87% and 99.89%, respectively. Section 4.2.5
presented a discussion of the severe chemical interferences in the analyses
of these samples. These interferences prevented attaining minimum detectable
concentrations sufficiently low so that calculated destruction efficiencies
would exceed 99.9%. For example, if the minimum detectable concentration of
TCDD in the benzene impinger sample of 8 August had been <0.017 ng/ml rather
than <0.034 ng/ml, then the calculated destruction efficiency would have been
>99.9%.
Tables 51 and 52 present, respectively, destruction efficiencies for
2,4-D plus 2,4,5-T calculated from TRW and BCL analyses of combustion efflu-
ent samples. All calculated destruction efficiencies are greater than 99.999%,
Indicative of incineration well in excess of permit requirements. It is
noteworthy that the TRW and BCL results for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were on samples
from different sampling trains using different analytical procedures as dis-
cussed in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.6, respectively. These high destruction effi-
ciencies for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T give confidence that the destruction efficiency
for TCDD was in excess of permit requirements.
Because of the possibility that chlorinated constituents of the waste
could be degraded into and emitted as simpler organochlorine compounds, results
of the GC/MS analyses (Table 30) of the Lear-Siegler train samples were exam- â€¢
ined for organochlorine compounds. Concentrations of these compounds were
summed, and destruction efficiencies were calculated. Table 53 presents emis-
sion concentrations and destruction efficiencies of organochlorine compounds
found in the Lear-Siegler train samples. It was assumed that the waste was
totally composed of organochlorine compounds. It can be seen that the
