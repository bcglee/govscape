1.2 BACKGROUND
The at-sea incineration of U.S. Air Force stocks of Herbicide Orange was a
complex undertaking. A Targe number of U.S. Government organizations and civil-
ian contractors contributed to the effort, and a brief discussion of the program
organization will be helpful in understanding the scope of this report.
Permits to incinerate the waste were granted to the U.S. Air Force, owner
of the waste, and to Ocean Combustion Services, B.V., of The Netherlands, owner
of the M/T Vulcanus, as co-permittees.
The U.S. EPA contracted with TRW, Inc., to perform environmental monitoring
during the incineration of the herbicide. This program was funded by the U.S.
Air Force. The scope of TRWs activities under this contract included design
and preparation of stack sampling and monitoring equipment, development of a
comprehensive personnel protection plan, development and implementation of a
sampling and analysis protocol., acquisition of samples and monitoring of combus-
tion effluent during incinerator operation, analysis of the samples and moni-
toring data, and evaluation of the results.
..'.:. TRW's role in the incineration program was thus limited to at-sea opera-
tions. It was TRW s responsibility to monitor. ,'the following permit conditions
(renuiiibered but verbatim from Reference, 1):
1. The Permittees are authorized to heat up incinerators with fuel
oil while in route to the site but may not incinerate the des-
cribed wastes except in the site which is defined in longitude
and latitude as follows: From 15 degrees 45 minutes to 17 degrees
45 minutes north latitude. From 171 degrees 30 minutes to
173 degrees 30 minutes west longitude.
2. During start-up, Herbicide Orange shall not be fed into the
incinerators until a flame temperature of 1280°C has been
reached in the furnace and only one burner at a time shall
be changed over to the waste. The start-up temperature of
1280°C must be reached before the next burner is changed
over to Herbicide Orange.
3. Monitoring of the furnaces for temperature, and for complete-
ness of combustion, shall be in effect during the change-over.
A record of temperature shall also be maintained during this
time.
4. The incinerator flame temperature shall be greater than
1250°C when burning waste.
