(28 4/m) sampling rate capability, is shown schematically in Figure 14. Sev-
eral important features are noteworthy:
• The water-cooled, quartz-lined probe was used to obtain the
sample.
• A solid sorbent trap was located in the sample line downstream
of (after) the heated line and upstream of the first impinger.
This trap was designed to trap the organic constituents. A bed
of-granular XAD-2® resin was used for the sorbent. The module
that houses the sorbent trap was water jacketed. Cold water
from the ice bath surrounding the impingers was pumped into
the jacket to maintain a gas out temperature of <16oc.
