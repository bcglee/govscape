• Composite1waste feed - Samples of waste being fed to the
incinerators were taken for determination of the composi-
tion of the waste. These samples were taken at burner
No. 4 rather than from the tanks.
• HCl measurements - Air was sampled with a Drager® appa-
r
ratus during incinerator operations to detect whether the
plume was contacting the ship.
• Air samples - Ambient air grab samples were taken at specific
locations using a gas syringe and analyzed for 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T by an onboard gas chromatograph.
• Wipe samples - Whatman 41® filter papers were used to wipe
selected areas of the ship. They were extracted and analyzed
by the onboard GC for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
• Workspace air mpnitors - MSA personnel monitors fitted with
Chromosbrb 102^ absorption tubes were placed at several
positions on the ship to monitor personnel exposure to
2,4-D and 2,4,5-T.
Samples of stack gas, burner residues, and composite feeds were taken for
completeness of sampling, and results are given in Section 4. HC1 measurements,
air samples, wipe samples, and workspace air monitor samples were taken as
part of the personnel protection plan and are discussed in Section 5.
3.1.1 On.-l.1ne Monitoring System/Portable laboratory
A standard shipping container was modified as a portable laboratory to
house the on-line monitoring instrumentation and to serve as the operations
room for the sampling team. Its overall dimensions were 2.4 x 6.1 x 2.4 m.
It was constructed of 2.54 cm plywood with an exterior fiberglass coat and was
built on a base of approximately 15 cm longitudinal and transverse structural
steel channels and beams. A hardwood floor of 5 cm dimensioned lumber was pro-
vided, and all corners had cast metal stacking and tie-down provisions for
securing the container to the ship's deck.
The container tare weight was 1,800 kg, and maximum gross weight was
20,000 kg. It is estimated that the total weight of the equipment and con-
tainer was 8,700 kg. It can be forklifted or hoisted by slings, and it is
