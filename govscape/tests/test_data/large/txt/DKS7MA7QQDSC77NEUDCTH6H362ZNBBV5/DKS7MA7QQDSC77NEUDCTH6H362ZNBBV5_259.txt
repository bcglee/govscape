9. DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCIES FOR TCDD FROM WSU ANALYSES
In the sample of 7/16/77, WSU found no TCDD. The minimum detectable con-
centrations (MOC) from Table 38 are used to calculate the maximum possible
amount of TCDD in the sample:
t Impinger: MDC * 0.68 ng in 725 ml = <0.68 ng
• Line rinse: MDC = 0.045 ng/ml x 42.5 ml * <1.91 ng
• Probe rinse: MDC * 0.086 ng/ml x 2.3 ml * <0.2 ng
The gas volume sampled was 0.1179 m . Thus, the emission concentration
of TCDD was:
«2.79 ng/0.1179 m3 = <23.6 ng/m3
From Table 49, the emission concentration of TCDD at 0% destruction effi-
3
cienc=yi was calculated to be 247 yg/m . The destruction efficiency for TCDD was
thus,
(247 yg/m3 - <0.0236 yg/m3)/247 yg/m3 = >0.9999
10. DESTRUCTION EFFICIENCIES FOR 2,4-0 AND 2,4,5-T FROM
LEAR-SIEGLER TRAIN ANALYSES
Destruction efficiencies for the waste or specific waste constituents are
based on comparing the input rate to the emission rate. That is,
DF = waste input - waste output ,
nn
utwaste waste input x iu
An equivalent method was used in this report. Emission concentrations at
Q% destruction efficiency were calculated from waste feed rates and combustion
effluent flow rates (Table 49). These values were compared with emission con-
centrations of, for example, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T calculated from the laboratory
analyses.
For the test of 7/16/77, neither 2,4-D nor 2,4,5-T was detected in the
sorbent trap, line rinse, or probe rinse samples. Considering the line rinse
only, 248 ml of a sample of 2191 ml (Table 25) were concentrated to 2 ml and
then analyzed by GC/MS. The GC/MS detection limit was 1 ng/yl. The volume of
