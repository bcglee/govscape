1) V(a), variance in weight percent of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in
herbicide
Front data presented in Table 11 giving the composition of
four Gulfport lots of herbicide, the mean and standard
deviation in the total of 2,4-D and 2,4Â»5-T in the herbicide
were calculated to be
a" = 0,8599%
s = 0.0547%

2) V(b), variance in emission concentration of 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T
From data presented in Table 51 giving the emission con-
centrations of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T calculated from analyses
at TRW, the mean and standard deviation emission concen-
tration of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-T were calculated to be
F = 46.7 yg/m3 = 46.7 x 10"12 metric tons/m3
s = 72.2 yg/m = 72.2 x 10""1 2 metric tons/3m
fa
3) V(d), variance in TCDD content of herbicide
The mean and standard deviation in TCDD content of the
herbicide were calculated from data presented in
Table 50,
3" = 1.916 x 10"6
- 7,238 x 10~7
4) V(e), variance in emission concentration of TCDD
Table 50 presents emission concentrations of TCDD calcu-
lated from the WSU analyses. The mean and standard devi-
ation are
e" - 186 ng/m - 1.86 x 10"13 metric tons/m3
s * 142 ng/m3 = 1.42 x 10"13 metric tons/m3
