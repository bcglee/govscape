The basic requirements for effective personnel hygiene against TCDD-
containing materials are:
• Protection of personnel for vapor and liquid contact in the
contaminated areas by source control and protective gear
• Provision of disposable clothing and foot covers
• Provision of disposal facilities at the interface region
between the contaminated and clean areas
• Provision for a shower, hand, face and eye-washing facilities

• Provision of clean clothing and foot covering at the boundary
of the clean area upon return to working areas
• Instruction in the use of the cleaning and protective equip-
ment and in methods of personal cleansing
• Mandatory and enforced use of the above facilities and
concepts.
Smoking, eating or drinking from containers or cups should be avoided in
potentially contaminated areas. This also applies to personnel who have not

nated areas.;
The routes by which personnel move should be so arranged that entrance to
the working area and exits from the working area are separate. Shoe covers
which can be disposed of must be provided at entrances, and provision for their
removal and disposal at exits must be made.
A monitoring system for ensuring that clean areas, such as the galley,
mess room, living quarters, bridge, toilets and passageways, should be devel-
oped and put into effect on a firm basis. A schedule of inspection of the
clean areas should be established, and the results of the monitoring made
known to the ship's master.

personal hygiene and of the consequences to themselves and others of poor per-

and personnel should be trained in personal hygiene practices. The effectiveness
