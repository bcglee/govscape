four tests from which samples were analyzed. These estimates are given in
Table 54. They should be considered upper bounds, that is, overestimates of
emissions of volatile hydrocarbons.
Analyses of th.e Lear-Si eg! er train samples (Table 30) showed that they
were quite complex. Trichlorophenol, a minor herbicide constituent, was found
in the sorbent trap of 13 August 1977 and was the only herbicide constituent
found in any Lear-Siegler train sample.
Aromatic hydrocarbons were shown to be present in the combustion efflu-
ent samples by the GC/MS analyses. The only reasonable source of these com-
pounds was synthesis in the flame because they were not constituents of the
