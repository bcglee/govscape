or
(0.7809S/0.2095)(1 + Y/100) moles N per 100 g herbicide (3)
2
where 0.7809 and 0.2095 are the fractional composition of
N2 and 02, respectively, in a standard dry atmosphere.
• On a dry basis, the moles of combustion effluent produced
per 100 g herbicide are
C/12.011 + C£/35.453 * SY/100
(4)
+ (0,78095/0.2095)(1 + Y/100)
• The stoichiometric air flow requirement per 100 g herbicide
is
S/0.2095 moles = K'
, *
Now, one mole of dry gas occupies 0.02406 m at 20°C. The
derivation up to this point has been based on 100 g herbicide. .
A waste feed of W metric tons per hour is W x 106/100 or
W x 104 times greater than 100 g. Thus, the stoichiometric
air flow rate requirement in dry m3/hr for W metric tons per
hour of herbicide is:
240.6S W/0.2095 m3/hr at 20°C (5)
• By definition, from Equation (2), the fraction of excess air
is
v/ioo * air "flow - stoichiometric air flow
' '. stoichiometric air flow
or
Y/100 - (A - 240.65 W/0.2095)/(24Q.6S W/0.2095)
