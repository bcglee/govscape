4. TOXICOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CHLOROPHENOXY HERBI-
CIDES PERTINENT TO POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF N-BUTYL ESTERS OF 2,4-0 AND
2.4,5-T: There have been many scientific studies to determine the behavior of
chlorophenoxy herbicides in plant and animal systems under varied environmental
conditions. The following paragraphs are not meant to list all those studies,
Rather, the purpose is to logically describe the known and probable behavior of
Orange herbicide components in biological systems by utilizing the most current
and relative information obtainable from the literature and from studies at
EHL(K). It is important to note at the outset that in biological systems and
aquatic systems the N-butyl esters (NBE) of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T can hydrolyze.
Thus, the behavior of the pure acids and their salts are also pertinent and
will be discussed in the following paragraphs along with characteristics of
ester forms. The differences in toxic effects produced by the various salts,
amines and esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T can often be explained on a pharmaco-
kinetic basis in which the concentrations at the receptor sites in the organism
depends on the absorption and distribution rates in relation to the rates of
metabolism and excretion. The rate of absorption into plants or animals will
be dependent upon various interrelated factors such as route of entry and rate
of membrane transport. Specific membrane .transport rate will depend upon the
characteristics of the membrane in relation to the size, shape, polarity and
lipid solubility of the particular herbicide molecule being considered in each
cited study.
a. Behavior in Terrestrial Animals
(1) Metabolism and Excretion Kinetics: Most of the data derived
from acute toxicity studies indicate that neither 2,4-D nor 2,4,5-T are partic-
ularly toxic. (Gleason ejt a_U, 1969; Bjorklund and Erne, 1966}. In the rat,
the single dose, LD ranges from about 250-270 rug/kg depending on the forms of
5Q
chemical administered (Christensen, 1971). Several workers have suggested that
part of the reason for this lack of toxicity is that the excretion of the herbi-
cides is very rapid in most mammals (Clark et.il-> 1964; Khanna and Fang, 1966).
Most studies indicate that animals possessing highly developed renal function
will rapidly eliminate 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T by active tubular secretion. Cattle
and rabbits, which normally actively metabolize compounds mostly by acetylation,
excrete 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in the urine mostly unchanged, Erne, (1966) found
