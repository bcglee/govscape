molecular ion peaks and reporting each species as a fraction of the total.
Reported levels are limited to major, minor, and trace designations.
Calculation ofApproximate Intensities
Estimates of compound classes, group types or "most probable" identified
compounds are made using the following calculation based on normalization:
hxfx
%X = —-i-2— (100)
En h_f
n n
where;
%X = Mole percent composition of a compound or group of com-
pounds making up a class
h s Sum of intensities and/or peak height(s) caused by
x
compound(s)
h * All observed peak heights and/or intensities
n
f and f * Instrument response factors which shall be considered
to*be equal to 1.
Accuracy and Precision
This, qualitative method is only roughly quantitative, The precision asso-
ciated with an L.RMS analysis of a solid sample has not been established. The
true value of a quantitative estimate should be expected to vary by a factor of
plus or minus 3. That is, the true value of X lies somewhere between one-third
and three times the reported value.
9. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS BY GC/MS
Scope and Application
Scope
This method is for the qualitative analysis of samples derived from the
incineration of Herbicide Orange. The quantisation of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T butyl
esters is provided; the quantitation of any other species found in the analysis
of these samples will be estimates. The manner in which the GC/MS data is
gathered and stored will enable the analyst to search for compounds known to be
