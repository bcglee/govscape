24 August. The changeover from diesel fuel to herbicide was completed by
0800 hours. On-line data were acquired during the changeover in the starboard
stack. At 1608 hours on 2 September, the last of the contaminated herbicide
was burned, and all burners were switched to the uncontanrinaten1 (TCDD-free,
detection limit of <0.02 ppm) herbicide that had been used to rinse the ship's
tanks in accordance with the U.S. EPA approved tank rinsing procedure. At
1150 hours on 3 September, the last of the TCDD-free herbicide tank rinsate had
been burned. The Vulcanus then left the burn zone and docked at Johnston Island
at 1330 hours on 4 September 1977.
During the first week of the third burn, the weather was unpleasant, and
the seas were much rougher than during the first and second burns. Rolls
averaged nearly 20 degrees to either side with a 30-degree maximum. All sam-
pling and monitoring activities were accomplished according to plan. Several
times the combustion effluent became visible as a plume for the first time dur-
ing all three burns (except for those times when ammonia was injected into the
stack) possibly because of high humidity from heavy rainfall. Winds were higher
(averaging 12 to 14 m/sec, 24 to 28 knots) than during the previous two burns,
so there were several instances when the plume partially eddied back onto the
ship. During these periods the ship was put under power and oriented to avoid
plume impingement.
Time averaged waste feed rates were not measured during the third burn.
This was because of the rough weather, which prevented accurate gauging as
tanks neared depletion, and to the tank rinsing procedure, which required waste
tanks at near depletion to be filled with rinsing material. An overall waste
feed rate was calculated from the total time of incineration and the volume of
material burned.
In order to reduce TCDD-contaminated herbicide residuals in the waste
tanks, a tank rinsing proce-dure was developed by the U.S. Air Force and approved
by the U.S. EPA. During the third burn, waste tanks were rinsed serially as
they were depleted by filling with TCDD-free herbicide. The TCDD-free rinsate
(647.4 metric tons) had been loaded at Gulfport into Tank 2C and had not been
incinerated during the first two burns. Used rinsate was incinerated at the end
of the third burn, and the amount of rinsate was included in the third burn
average feed rate. . -.•••"''
