for the stronger functional groups of the compound to become apparent for inter-
pretive purposes. Organic solvents, water and some inorganic materials cause
interferences. Water and other substances may also cause a decrease in the
quality (e.g., resolution of a spectrum, sensitivity) of the analysis.
Summary of Method
The sample or LC fraction, after evaporation, is either (1) taken up in a
small amount of methylene chloride and transferred to a KBr salt plate, or (2)
mixed in a KBr mull and pressed into a pellet. A grating IR spectrophotometer
is used to scan the sample in the IR region from 2.5 to 25 microns. The spec-
trum is then interpreted to determine functional groups types in the sample.
Definitions
Sample cell - Two KBr salt plates with the sample sandwiched in between.
Sample Hand!ing and Preservation
These samples are typically found in the aluminum weighing dishes in which
solvent, water or other volatile matter has been removed by evaporation or des-
iccation. The samples should be covered and stored in a refrigerator when not
being used. All glassware, implements, etc., should be carefully cleaned, sol-
vent rinsed, and dried before use in this procedure. Contact of sample with
hands, fingers and other sources of outside contamination shall be,avoided.
Equipment
Infrared (IR) spectrophotometer, grating dispersion. Perkin-
Elmer 521 or equivalent.
KBr salt plates -Configured to fit sample holder of spectro-
photometer. Transparent to the IR in the 2.5 to 15 micron
region.
KBr pellet press — Hydraulic type is preferred (Carver Model C
or equivalent) but hand-held devices are acceptable, e.g.,
Perkin-Elmer 186-0436 or equivalent.
KBr pellet die — To prepare 13 mm diameter or equivalent pellet
to contain approximately 1 mg of sample. Perkin-Elmer 186-00250
or equivalent.
Pipette, Pasteur, disposable - Sargent S-69647-3Q or equivalent.
Standard polystyrene film sample —Normally supplied by
instrument manufacturer.
