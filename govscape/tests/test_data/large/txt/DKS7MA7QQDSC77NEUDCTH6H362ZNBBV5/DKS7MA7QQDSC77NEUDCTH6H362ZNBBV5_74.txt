4.2.1 Detection Limits
It will benseen later in this section that incineration of Herbicide
Orange was quite..effective. Neither 2,4-D nor 2,4,5-T was found in any com-
bustion effluent sample. The definition and usage of detection limits are thus
of importance in presenting the results of the analyses and in calculating
destruction efficiencies.
A detection limit is that amount of sought-for substance (analyte) which
gives a detectable signal. There are various definitions of what constitutes
a detectable signal; in the GC and GC/MS analyses in this program, a peak height
three times the noise level is considered detectable. Quantitation at the detec-
tion limit is marginal (Â± factor of 2-3) because the signal is not much larger
than the noise.
The minimum detectable quantity may be defined as that amount of analyte
which produces a signal which is quantitatable with some specified level of
precision. The precision of quantitation at the minimum detectable quantity
is usually greater than at the detection limit.
If the analyte is not detected, it may still be present in the sample but
in an amount that does not produce a detectable signal. If the detection limit
is adequate for the purposes of the analysis, it is used to set an upper bound
on the analyte concentration which is indicated as less than (<) the value of
the detection limit.
4.2.2 TRW Analytical Methodology
The TRW analyses employed a variety of techniques to develop estimates of
the amounts and kinds of organic compounds emitted during the incineration
process. The analytical scheme was a modified U.S. EPA Level I approach/ * '
Figure 16 is a flow chart of the analytical scheme. A brief description is
given below. Detailed procedures are given in Appendix C.
