The furnace volume was 120 m , the average emission rate was calculated
to be 65,838 m3/hr, and the average flame temperature, T, was 1500°C (1773°K).
Therefore, the average incinerator residence time for all three burns was
+ - 120 m3 , ,

5. GRAVIMETRIC ANALYSES
For sample HO-1-ST-714-F, the pentane extract was made to 300 ml. A 2-ml
aliquot was taken for the C7-C16 GC analysis, the remaining 298 ml volume was
concentrated to 2 ml. A 0.5 ml aliquot of the concentrate was used for the
gravimetric analysis, and a residue weight of 0.561 mg was obtained. A 300-ml
aliquot of pentane gave a nonvolatile residue weight of 0.422 mg
0.561 mg X Z ml/0.5 ml X 300 ml/298 ml - 0.422 mg = 1.837 mg residue
6. VOLATILE HYDROCARBON EMISSIONS
A 2-ml aliquot of the line.rinse of 7/14/77 was taken for the C7-C16 GC
analysis. The volume of line rinse attributable to the Lear-Siegler train sam-
ple was 2098 ml. The analysis of this sample indicated a concentration of
14 ng/yl of species in the C8 boiling point range
14 ng/yl X 103 yl/ml X 2098 ml X (1/6.2012 m3) X 10"6 mg/ng - 7.5 mg/m3
7. GC/MS ANALYSES OF LEAR-SIEGLER TRAIN SAMPLES
In the sample HO-1-ST-716-H, dichlorobiphenyl was detected at 10 ng/pl.
The volume of this sorbent trap extract was 350 ml, of which 348 ml were concen-
trated to 2 ml (Table 25). GC/MS analysis was performed on the concentrate.
The volume of gas sampled by that sorbent trap was 6.0914 m3 (Table 6). The
emission concentration of dichlorobiphenyl was
10 ng/ul X 103 yl/ml X 10"3 g/ng X 2 ml X 350 ml/348 ml X 1/6.0914 m3
