salts of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and about 80 ppm of arsenic. This material was
consolidated into tank 6P. In addition, tank 6P was then filled with herbicide
from Johnston Island. It was planned to flash the water layer through the star-
board stack by feeding one burner from tank 6P and the other two burners from
tanks 35 and 3P. It was planned to acquire a stack sample and on-line data dur-
Jng the flashing. However, the flashing period lasted only a few minutes.
Therefore, no stack sample was acquired. Flame temperatures were observed with
the optical pyrometer every 5 minutes during this period, and the lowest temper-
ature observed was 1408Â°C.
There were no major problems encountered during the second burn. The
on-line instrumentation was the source of continuous minor problems, especially
the CO and hydrocarbon analyzers and the gas conditioners. Alteration of the
inlet and outlet manifolds to the on-line instruments prevented the accumulation
of condensate which had damaged instruments during the first burn, but the CO
analyzers tended to be noisier than during the first burn and required more
frequent adjustment and balancing. On 11 August, no on-line data were acquired
because all three CO analyzers were inoperative. The refurbished hydrocarbon
analyzer was inoperative because the proportional temperature controllers oper-
ated improperly (both controllers were on continuously). Parts from the refur-
bished HC analyzer were used to keep the other HC analyzer operating. About
halfway through burn two, one gas conditioner began leaking stack gas into the
portable laboratory. Switching gas conditioners alleviated the problem.
Because of these problems, on-line monitoring was limited to 1 hour per day.
The incinerators shed particulates from the firebrick linings which caused
frequent plugging of the heat-traced lines.
A minor problem was the loss of voice communication with Johnston Island
on 11 August. The M/T Vulcanus could not transmit but could receive voice com-
munications. Thereafter, communication from the M/T Vulcanus was by continuous
wave. Communications were slower and more cumbersome, but no problems were
caused by the loss of voice communication.
3.2.3 Third Burn Commentary and Problems
The M/T Vulcanus sailed from Johnston Island for the third burn at
1905 hours on 23 August 1977 and entered the burn zone at 0600 hours on
