Sample Handling and Preservation
. -\ 5 t-\
After, extraction, a 2 ml aliquot of each sample is set aside in the sample
bank, For each C7-C12 GC analysis, obtain the sample far enough ahead of time
for it to warm to room temperature, For example, after one analysis is started,
return that sample to the sample bank and obtain the next sample.
Apparatus
A Varian 1860 gas chromatograph, equipped with dual flame ionization
detectors and a linear temperature programmer is used in this procedure. Any
equivalent instrument can be used provided that electrometer settings, etc.,
be changed appropriately. A 6-ft x 1/8-in. OD stainless steel column of 10%
OV-101 on 100/120 mesh supelcoport® is used.
Procedures
Setup and Checkout -
Each day, the operator will verify the following:
1. Carrier gas first-stage regulator >100 psig.
2. Carrier gas second-stage regulator >100 psig.
3. Air first-stage regulator >100 psig.
4. Air second-stage regulator 50 ±5 psig.
5. Hydrogen first-stage regulator >100 psig.
6. Hydrogen second-stage regulator 50 ±5 psig. If any first-stage
regulator indicates <100 psig, the cylinder is considered empty
and will be replaced. After replacing a cylinder, all connec-
tions will be leak checked up to and including the connection
to the chromatograph.
7. Verify carrier gas flow rate is 30 ±2 ml/m1n. Flow rate is
checked at analytical column outlet after disconnection from
the instrument,
8. Verify hydrogen flow rate 1s 30 ±2 ml/m1n. Flow rate is
checked at gas control panel on the GC,
9. Verify air flow rate 1s 300 ±20 ml/min. Flow rate 1s checked
at gas control panel on the GC.
