times required to pump out the tanks were measured. During the first burn, as
described in Section 3.2, some of the tanks were not completely emptied. The
contents of these tanks were gauged after returning to Johnston Island, and the
feed rates were corrected for residual waste. On the second and third burns,
the tanks were emptied to near dryness, which meant residuals of 20 to 50 liters
according to the ship's Chief Engineer.
3.4.5 Temperature Measurements
Permit conditions required hourly notation of the temperatures of the con-
troller and indicator thermocouples. The ship's engineering staff entered
temperature readings in the log and made them available to test personnel.
Once each day the flame temperature of each incinerator was measured with an
optical pyrometer.
3.5 COMBUSTION EFFLUENT SAMPLES ACQUIRED
Samples acquired onboard the M/T Vulcanus relating to the combustion proc-
ess were: heat-traced line rinses, probe rinses, sorbent traps, benzene impin-
gers, composite feeds, grab gas bags, and burner residues. Probe rinses, heat-
traced line rinses, sorbent traps, and benzene impingers were combustion efflu-
:ent samples. Composite feed samples were necessary to calculate destruction
efficiencies for the combustion process. Burner residue samples were acquired
because they may be a waste disposal problem. On the M/T Vulcanus, however,
burner residues were returned to the incinerator, so that they were neither a
disposal problem nor an emission. Table 5 shows the dates of the tests, the
sampling times, volumes of dry gas acquired, moisture content of the gas sam-
ples, average waste feed rates for each test, and the samples which were taken.
Initially, it was intended to rinse the probe only once after each shipload was
incinerated. It was decided after the first two tests during the first burn to
rinse the probe after each test, if practicable; it was thought, as discussed in
Section 3.2.1, that excess condensation might be occurring in the probe because
of lower.than desirable sample outlet gas temperatures.
The Lear-Siegler and USAF-OEHL sampling trains were operated simultaneously,
pulling combustion effluent through the same probe and heat-traced line. One
Lear-Siegler sample of about 4 m and three impinger samples of about 0.1 m
each were acquired per test. Thus, a complete sorbent trap or impinger sample
