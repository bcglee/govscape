The thermocouples used to activate the automatic waste shutoff system and
the recording equipment have been quite reliable and durable according to per-
sonnel of the M/T Vulcanus. There were no failures during the operations cov-

2.4.3 Emergency Automatic Waste Shutoff
A Plastomatic 2000 system (supplied by Withoff-Phillips, Bremen, West
Germany) was used for the emergency automatic waste shutoff. This system uses
a thermocouple controlled, spring loaded, solenoid actuated valve which shuts
off waste to the burners when the temperature of the furnace drops below a pre-
set selected temperature. During these tests the U.S. EPA required the Plasto-
matic controller to be set such that waste flow would be shut off if the flame
temperature dropped below 1250Â°C.
If the temperature in a furnace should drop below the preselected minimum,
the Plastomatic 2000 solenoid is deactivated, allowing a spring loaded valve to
close, shutting off the flow of waste to the three burners of that furnace.
The valve which is closed shuts the waste line in both directions and also stops
the waste pumps by cutting power to them. A power failure or thermocouple burn-
out in the Plastomatic 2000 system would also shut off the flow of waste to the
burners involved.
If the system should shut off the waste flow, the pump which has been
stopped and the valves which have been closed may be restarted after the cause
has been identified and corrected and after the Plastomatic has been reset. It
should be noted that operating procedures require restart and reestablishment
of the required flame temperature using fuel oil before waste can be burned
again.
The controller thermocouple was also utilized to indicate real-time tempera-
ture measurements. This was accomplished by adjusting the controller dial from
the shutoff temperature setting to increasingly higher temperature settings.
When the adjusted setting was coincident with the actual temperature sensed by
this thermocouple, the feed valve relay clicked. Observation of the pointer
location with respect to the temperature scale on the dial provided a tempera-
ture reading. The waste shutoff system was not Immediately activated because
a time delay was incorporated in the electrical circuit. The pointer was then
