The two major constituents of Herbicide Orange, the butyl esters of.2,4,-D
and 2,4,5-T, are of moderate toxicity to mammals. The acute oral and dermal
L.DCQ values of the 2,4-D acid to the rat have been reported to be 375 and
1500 mg/kg body weight respectively. The acute oral LD of mixed butyl esters
50
of 2,4-D to rats is 620 mg/kg. The acute oral LDgg of the 2,4,5-T acid to rats
is 500 mg/kg. Chronically, both 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are of low toxicity, because
of the highly developed kidney function possessed by mammals that will rapidly
eliminate 2.,4-D-and 2,4,5-T by active tubular secretion. Thus, the cumulative
effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are minimal. The American Conference of Govern-
mental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommended Threshold Limit Values (TLV)
for either 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T is 10 mg/m3. The TLV is a time-weighted safe air
concentration for an 8-hour work day or 40-hour work week. Based upon the TLV,
a range of time limited ambient (personnel breathing zone) concentrations con-
sidered safe exposure levels for personnel on board the M/T Vulcanus is as

Th'e;;detai1ed toxicological properties of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, as compiled
by the U.S. Air Force, are described in Reference 1. In addition to the toxi-
cological hazards, Herbicide Orange is also flammable.
LD - Lethal dose fifty. A calculated dose of a chemical substance which is
5n
expected to cause the death of 50% of an entire population of an experi-
mental animal species, as determined from the exposure to the substance,
by any route other than inhalation, of a significant number from that
population.
