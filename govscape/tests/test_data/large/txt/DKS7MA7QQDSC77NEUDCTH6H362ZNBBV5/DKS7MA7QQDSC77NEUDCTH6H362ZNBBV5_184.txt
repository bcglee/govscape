bluegills. Survivors of ponds treated with high concentrations (10 and 5 ppm)
had a 2 week delay in spawning. For pathologic lesions, high-treatment fish
had earlier and more severe effects than did low-treatment fish. The pathology
involved the liver, vascular system and brain. Remarkably, growth of the fish
was faster in the ponds receiving the high~treatment than in the lower-treatment
ponds. Tables B-4 and B-5 were extracted from a U.S. Forest Service Environ-
mental Impact Statement (EIS-OR, 1973). The tables indicate the effects of
herbicides on other aquatic species and point out some toxic effects that can
be measured other than death of the organisms.
d. Behavior in Plants
(1) Pistribution and Metabolism: Orange herbicide is a systematic
herbicide that affects plants by a hormonal type of action usually described
as "auxin-like" or "auxin-type." Auxins are any of a group of substances which
promote plant growth by cell elongation, bring about root formation, or cause
bud inhibition or other effects. 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are compounds of this type.
When applied to leaves of a plant, chlorophenoxy herbicides are absorbed through
the cuticle into the plant system. The N-butyl ester forms of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T
found in Orange herbicide are usually more effective than more polar forms
because of better absorption into the plant. This is also demonstrated in
Yamaguchi's work (1965) in which he found that 2,4-D moves into plant leaves
better from acidic solutions than from alkaline solutions. Approximately ten
times as much 2,4-D was absorbed from a medium having pH 3 than one with pH 11.
2,4-D has a pK of 2.8 and would be highly disassociated at pH 11. Once the
a
herbicide is in the plant it is translocated to areas where food is being stored
as in rapidly growing new roots and shoots. The chlorophenoxy herbicides can
be stored in certain cells of the plant. Also, metabolism occurs through deg-
radation of the acetic acid side chain, hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, or
conjugation.
(2) Toxicity: Once in the plant, herbicides act by interfering
with the photosynthetic, respiratory, and other plant processes causing the
plant to lose its leaves and ultimately die. Plant susceptibility to sub-
lethal exposures of 2,4-D is markedly influenced by the growth condition of
the plant and by environmental factors. Since most of the injury is expressed
by growth response, the plant must be growing in order to show injury. In
