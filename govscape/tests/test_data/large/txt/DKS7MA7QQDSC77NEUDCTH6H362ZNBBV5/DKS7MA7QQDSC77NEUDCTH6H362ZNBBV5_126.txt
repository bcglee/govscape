During the debriefing on Johnston Island after the first burn, the problem
of flameouts was discussed. Water layers that had caused the problem were anal-
yzed and found to be 99% water, about 1% sodium salts of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, and
about 80 ppm arsenic. All of this material remaining in the ship's tanks was
consolidated into Tank 6P. A procedure for flashing (evaporating) this material
during the second burn was developed and a stack gas sampling test was planned.
The procedure was:
• The test was to be performed on the starboard incinerator. The
. burner nearest the wall thermocouples was to be shut off.
t Herbicide would be fed through the remaining two burners at a
rate consistent with optimum incinerator performance. The flame
temperature had to exceed the permit minimum of 1250°C.
t The water was to be fed into the third (off) burner, starting
with a minimum feed rate.
• The following parameters were to be checked before increasing
the water feed rate: flame temperature, wall thermocouple
temperature, on-line instrumentation data, and appearance of
the stack effluent.
: • : ;ln addition,to the flashing procedure, a procedure to reduce the impact of
;
,f,;lameouts was /developed during the debriefing. This procedure was in effect
during the second and third burns and called for:
• When nearing depletion of a tank, switch two of the three
burners in each incinerator to a full tank, leaving one burner
in each incinerator to complete emptying the first tank. .,„
• Put the ship under power at a proper orientation to the wind
direction (Figure 18).
There were no plume impingements during the second burn. During the third
burn, there were several partial plume impingements when the plume eddied back
onto the ship. These impingements were of short duration (10 to 30 seconds)
and were caused by stormy weather during most of the burn. There was minimal
personnel exposure, and post-program physical exams showed no effects.
5.5.2 Spills
There were several minor spills of herbicide during onboard operations.
They were documented as they occurred. Figure 19 is a schematic of the Vul-
canus1 main deck showing cargo tank layout, tank hatches, and spill locations.
