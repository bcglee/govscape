molecular weight in order to convert to ppm. Conversions of mg/m to ppm,
3 3
yg/m to ppb, and ng/m to parts per trillion (ppt) are illustrated below.
Sample HO-1-ST-714-F was found (Table 27) to have 0.23 mg/m3 of hydrocarbons
quantitated as CIO (n-decane, 144 g/mole). The sample gas volumes were corrected
to 20 C, at which temperature one mole of gas occupies 0.02406 m . To convert
0.23 mg/m to ppm:
0.23 mg/m3 x 10"3 g/mg x (1/144 g/mole) x 0.02406 m3/mole x 106 = 0.038 ppm
Sample HO-l-ST-716 was found (Table 30) to have 3 yg/m3 (20°C) of
dichlorobiphenyl (223.1 g/mole). To convert 3 pg/m3 to ppb;
3 yg/m3 x 10"6 yg/g x (1/223.1 g/mole) x 0.02406 m3/mole x 109 = 0.32 ppb
TCDO (322.0 g/mole) was not detected in sample HO-l-BI-716 (Table 50).
The detection limit was used to calculate a maximum possible TCDD concentration
of <5.8 ng/m (20°C). To convert <5.8 ng/m3 to ppt:
<5.8 ng/m3 x 10"9 ng/g x (1/322 g/mole) x 0.02406 m3/mole x 1012
= <0.43 ppt
