4.1.2 Waste Feed Rate /
Time averaged feed rates were recorded by tank during the first and
second burns. Tables 17 and 18 present these data, giving burn times, volumes
and weights of material burned, and burn rates in metric tons per hour. Dur-
ing the third burn, rough seas precluded measuring tank residuals (Section
3.2.3), so that incremental burn rates were not recorded. The average feed
rate for the third burn was 15.2 metric tons per hour (3706 metric tons, 3114 m ,
in 244 hours). The overall amount of material incinerated during the third burn
o
included 86.7 metric tons (85 m ) of herbicide contaminated water and 647.4 metric
tons (544 m ) of TCDD-free herbicide that was used to rinse the waste tanks.
Specific gravities of five samples (Table 5) of first-burn herbicide were
measured by WSU. These averaged 1.17 g/crn . WSU also measured the specific
gravity of samples from the second and third burns, and both had specific
gravities of 1.19 g/cm . These specific gravities were used to convert volumes
of herbicide burned to mass flow rates.
4.1.3 Temperature and Residence Time
Both direct flame and wall temperature thermocouple measurements were made
during, incinerator operation. Wall thermocouple temperatures (controller
and indicator thermocouples) were recorded hourly by the ship's crew for both
of the incinerators. Independent flame temperature measurements were measured
daily using a visible light Optical pyrometer manufactured by Leeds & Northrop
(Catalog No. 8632-F). Average daily flame and wall temperatures measured
together with standard deviations during Herbicide Orange incineration are
presented in Tables 19, 20, and 21 for each burn period.
These data indicate that the incinerator temperatures were consistently
uniform and comparable. The low variation in the temperature measurements,
particularly the flame temperatures, correlates well with the relatively con-
stant combustion efficiencies derived from the on-line data and indicates well-
controlled combustion during each burn.
