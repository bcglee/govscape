searching for hazardous compounds or compounds which may be generally consid-
ered toxic. Examples are aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated organics. Anal-
ysis using different sample ionizing parameters results in molecular weight
data which, combined with IR and sample data, can provide specific compound
category identifications on a "most probable" basis.
The MS instrument when used in this procedure has a sensitivity such that
1 nanogram or less presented to the ionizing chamber can result in a full
spectrum with a signal to noise ratio of 10:1. A dynamic range of 250,000 or
better is achievable.
However, the detection limit for a specific compound related to the size
of an air sample or liquid sample will vary widely depending on the types and
amounts of species in the mixture. This is because of the interfering effect
that each compound has on the spectral data. The impact of this interference
phenomenon can be reduced by lowering the ionization voltage resulting in spec-
tra containing largely molecular ions. This is discussed later.
Summary of Method
The samples are dissolved in a small amount of solvent and placed in a
sample cup or capillary of the direct insertion probe using a syringe. More
volatile samples are weighed into a cuvette for assembly into a batch or liquid
inlet system. The probe or cuvette is temperature programmed from ambient
temperature up to 300Â°C. Periodic MS scans are taken of the volatilized sam-
ple during the program using either an ionizing voltage of 70eV or a lower
range (10-15eV) or both. This is at the discretion of the operator depending
upon the real time data he is observing. The resulting spectra are interpreted
using reference compound spectra libraries, IR data, and other chemical infor-
mation known about the sample. The result is compound type information, groups
of homologous compounds, and in some cases specific compounds.
Definitions
LRMS - Low resolution mass spectrometry. Low resolution in
this sense means that typically only unit mass data are used,
and the instrument resolution can separate adjacent peaks
differing by one atomic mass unit (AMU).
