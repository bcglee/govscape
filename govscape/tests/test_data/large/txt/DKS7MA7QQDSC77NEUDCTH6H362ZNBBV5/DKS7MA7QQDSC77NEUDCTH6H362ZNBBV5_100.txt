caused minimum detectable concentrations to be variable and higher than they
would have been in the absence of the interferences.
4.2.6 BatteH e-Columbus Laboratories Analytical Methodology
Battelle-Columbus Laboratories (BCL), under contract to the U.S. Air Force,
set up and staffed a laboratory on Johnston Island for land based environmental
monitoring during the dedrumming operation. BCL provided quick-response analy-
ses for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in combustion effluent and drinking water samples from
the shipboard incineration. BCL also analyzed for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T the work-
®
space air monitor Chromosorb 102 samples taken onboard the ship.
Combustion effluent samples (probe and heat-traced lines rinses and benzene
impingers) were analyzed directly by gas chromatography with electron capture
detection (GC-ECD). Ship's drinking water samples were first extracted with
«\
hexane and then analyzed by GC-ECD. The Chromosorb 102 tube workspace air
monitor samples were extracted in a soxhlet apparatus for 1 hour with pentane,
concentrated, and then analyzed by GC-ECD.

4.2.7.1 Analyses of Workspace Air Monitor Samples
Results of the analyses of workspace air monitor samples by BCL are given
in Tables 39 arid 40. These results are discussed in Section 5.3.2.
4.2.7.2 Analyses of Combustion Effluent Samples
Table,..41 presents the results of analyses of combustion effluent samples
by BCL. A peak having the correct retention time for 2,4-D was found in the
chrornatogram of the probe rinse of 8/13/77. This cannot, however, be
considered conclusive proof that 2,4-D was present. Neither 2,4-D nor 2,4,5-T
were found in any other combustion effluent sample.
4.2.7.3 Analyses of Potable Water. Samples
Three samples of drinking water from the M/T Vulcanus were analyzed for
2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Neither compound was detected, as shown in Table 42.
