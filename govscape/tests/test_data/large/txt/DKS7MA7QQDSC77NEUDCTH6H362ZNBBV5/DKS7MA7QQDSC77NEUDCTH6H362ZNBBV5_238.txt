butyl ester of 2,4,5-T. The results of these calculations are presented in
Table D-3, and indicate that the adiabatic flame temperature would be between
1568 and 1253°^ .(corresponding to an estimated actual flame temperature of
1470 to 1150°C) when the oxygen level in the product gas is between 6.3 and
9.9 mole percent and the air to Herbicide Orange feed ratio is between 7.9 and
10.6 M3 air/kg Herbicide Orange.
In Figure D-l, the calculated adiabatic flame temperatures are presented
as a function of the air to Herbicide Orange feed ratio. It may be noted that
the adiabatic flame temperature can be as high as 1900°C under oxygen deficient
conditions, and hence temperature control alone is inadequate to ensure com-
plete combustion.
2. ESTIMATION OF EMISSION LEVELS
The thermochemical analysis discussed in the previous section provides
information on the equilibrium product distribution from the incineration of
Herbicide Orange. These thermochemical calculations, however, cannot be used
to estimate the emission levels of 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T or TCDD. the free energies
o,f 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T or TCDD .are considerably higher than the free energies
