hatch was subjected to a spill. The amount Involved ,in these spills is esti-
mated at 10 to 20 ml per spill,
A full, liter sample bottle was knocked off the port Butterworth hatch of
-' • • ?
Tank 4C. It broke on the deck, and the spill covered an area of perhaps 0.5 m .
The spill was immediately covered with absorbent, which was later gathered,
bagged, and burned. The location is indicated in Figure 19 as Spill 1.
The amount of herbicide spilled during the tank sampling was small. How-
ever, the first set of wipe samples analyzed after sailing showed traces of
herbicide in the port and starboard companionways, the floor outside the dining
roonu and the floor of the dining room. Intensive cleaning activities were
initiated, and herbicide in these areas was reduced below detectable levels.
It is possible that the pump room was the source of some part of the herbicide
found in living areas of the ship. During the loading operations, there was
considerable traffic into and out of the pump room. If the usual at-sea pre-
cautions (coveralls and boot covers or separate pairs of shoes) were not
observed during loading, then herbicide could have been carried out of the pump
.room and into other areas,of the ship. : \ .
. ; , The same tank sampling activity was required prior to, sailing for the third
burn.. Precautions to eliminate or reduce spills caused by tank sampling were
taken. The U.S. EPA observer indicated there were no spills from this tank
sampling.
TGDD-free herbicide (herbicide with a TCOD content below detection limits,
0,02 ppm) was stored in Tank 2C, the largest tank. During the third burn, each
tank, after having been drained of waste herbicide, was rinsed by filling with
TCDD-free herbicide. The waste tanks were rinsed serially. This procedure was
intended to reduce residual waste herbicide by dilution with TCDD-free,herbicide.
The waste containing tanks were drained to dryness (observed by TRW and/or
U.S. Air Force personnel) before rinsing.
During loading the ship with waste, the venting system was capable of
equalizing pressure sufficiently rapidly so that hatch covers were dogged down
tightly. During incineration, however, hatch covers had to be partially open,
as the tank venting system apparently could not equalize pressure rapidly
enough. Similarly, tank access hatches had to be open during tank rinsing
operations.
