3.4 ON BOARD DETERMINATION OF STACK EMISSIONS OF
HERBICIDE ORANGE CONSTITUENTS
In addition to monitoring the CO and C0Â« levels in the stack gas, grab
samples collected from the benzene impinger will also be directly injected into
a GC equipped with a FID for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T analyses by TRW. The GC/FID
combination provides a lower detection limit of approximately 1.0 mg/m for
2,4-D or 2,4,5-T in the stack gas. For on-board safety requirements, the
allowable limit for combined 2,4-D/2,4,5-T concentration in the stack gas will
3
be 130 mg/m based upon a 99.9 percent destruction efficiency. The TLV for
either 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T is 10 mg/m3.
Incineration will be terminated if the combined 2,4-0/2,4,5-T concentration
in the stack gas is in excess of 130 mg/m .
3.5 ONBOARD DETERMINATION OF AMBIENT LEVEL OF
HERBICIDE ORANGE CONSTITUENTS
Ambient 2,4-0/2,4,5-T concentrations result from atmospheric dispersion of
stack emissions as well as any fugitive emissions onboard the M/T Vulcanus.
The TRW team leader will alert shipboard personnel and direct, the location and
elimination of such emission sources. Incineration will be terminated and/or
shipboard personnel withdrawn if the combined ambient (personnel breathing zone)
level of 2,4-0/2,4,5-T is in excess of 2.0 mg/m3 over a 16-hour period, or in
excess of 10 mg/m over an 8-hour period.
