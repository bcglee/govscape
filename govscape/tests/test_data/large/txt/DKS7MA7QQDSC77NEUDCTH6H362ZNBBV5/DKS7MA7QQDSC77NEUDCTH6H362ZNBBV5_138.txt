;
Estimates of emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons can be obtained from the GC/MS
analyses. Table 55 presents these estimates.
Destruction efficiencies for 2,4-D plus 2,4,5-T were all in excess of
99.999%, indicative of highly efficient incineration. Destruction efficiencies
for TCDD were greater than 99.9% for two of the tests and greater than 99.87%
and 99.89% for two other tests. Because of the very high destruction efficien-
cies for 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and the chemical interferences in the TCDD analyses,
it is probable that the destruction efficiencies for TCDD were similarly very
high and certainly in excess of 99.9%.
