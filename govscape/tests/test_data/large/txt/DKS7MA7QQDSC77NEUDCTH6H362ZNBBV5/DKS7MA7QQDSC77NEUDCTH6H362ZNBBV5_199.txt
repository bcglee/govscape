After extraction, the analysis of the extract or neat organic liquid pro-
ceeds in several steps. An aliquot is taken for GC analysis of hydrocarbons
boiling in the range of the C7-C16 n-alkanes (90-300Â°C). The remainder of the
extract is then concentrated to 2 ml. A 0.25-ml aliquot is set aside for
qualitative GC/MS analysis, and a 0.5-ml aliquot is taken and evaporated for
gravimetric and IR analysis. The GC analysis provides information'on the
quantity of higher boiling hydrocarbons in the sample. The infrared spectrum
provides information on the major types of functional groups present in the
sample. The data obtained in the GC and IR analyses are complementary: most
compounds detected in the GC analyses are too volatile to remain for the IR
analysis, and compounds seen in the IR analysis are too involatile to be
detected in the GC analysis. This complementarity also applies between the
GC and LC analyses. All functional groups identified in the total sample must
be accounted for in succeeding analyses. If there is sufficient material in
the concentrated extracts, a portion of the extract providing not less than
50 mg is taken for liquid chromatographic separation into eight fractions. An
IR spectrum is obtained on each fraction. If there is sufficient material in
the LC fraction, a low resolution mass spectrum (LRMS) is measured. A low
resolution mass spectrum will provide more information on compound types and,
in some cases, may permit the analyst to identify specific compounds.
The remaining sections of this appendix contain procedures for sample
preparation, analyses, and handling of samples for the various analyses. A
separate document will address safety aspects of handling these samples.
2. EXTRACTION OF SOLID SAMPLES FOR ORGANICS
Scope and Application
The purpose of this procedure is to prepare solid samples for subsequent
Level I analyses for organics. The solid samples that may be generated on this
program are XAD-2 resin samples and burner head residues. Various sizes of
Soxhlet extractors may be used for this procedure depending upon the size of
the sample and the estimated concentration of organics in the sample. Thus,
before this procedure is begun, there is a decision point to select the appro-
priate size of Soxhlet extractor to be used.
