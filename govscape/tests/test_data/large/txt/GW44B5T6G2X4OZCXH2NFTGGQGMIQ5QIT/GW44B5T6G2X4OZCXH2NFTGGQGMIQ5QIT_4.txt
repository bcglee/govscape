When food substitutions are made due to an emergency situa-
tion (e.g., food shortage), it may be impractical for menu plan-
ners to revise menus and recalculate nutrient amounts, espe-
cially if the emergency arises just prior to the menu being
prepared. For this reason, USDA regulations require a school
district or school on NSMP to reanalyze if the substitution

nutrient standards.
When using NSMP or ANSMP to plan reimbursable meals,
SFAs are expected to make substitutions only due to unfore-
seen circumstances. Remember, reimbursable meals are
based on the ability to meet the nutrient standard(s). Some
examples include:
n Food shortage (food not delivered);
n Improper delivery (incorrect product delivered),
n Crop failure (food unavailable);
n Significant cost increase in food items; and
n Effective use of leftovers (see discussion on page 106 of this
chapter).
