This list suggests foods that might be added or substituted in
menus in order to increase the amount of a particular nutri-
ent found to be below the nutrient standard in the week√ïs
breakfasts or lunches. For example, if your weekly menu is
still high in fat and low in iron, a database search may be
conducted for a list of vegetables that contain less than 3
grams of fat and also at least two milligrams of iron.
When replacing a food, be sure that the levels of the other
nutrients in the menu are maintained. After deciding which
foods to change and/or which foods to add to the menu, nutri-
ent values need to be recalculated and compared to the nutri-
ent standards.

After modifications have been made, print out the appropri-
ate reports to review the new nutrient analyses. If nutrient
targets have still not been met, continue the process
described above until the nutrient standards have been met.

Substitutions
Occasionally it may be necessary to make a substitution to a
planned menu due to various reasons such as food shortage,
improper delivery from vendors, or effective use of leftovers.
This is a concern because:
n Substitutions change the nutrient content; and
n Meals may or may not continue to meet the nutrient
standard(s).
