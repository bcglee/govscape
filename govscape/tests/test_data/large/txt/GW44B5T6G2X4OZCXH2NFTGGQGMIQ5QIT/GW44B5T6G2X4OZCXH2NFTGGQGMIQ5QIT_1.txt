Evaluate menus
The final process of nutrient analysis is to evaluate the
menus and modify accordingly to meet the nutrient standards.
Review printed daily and weekly nutrient analyses.
1. Review the menus for variety
n Are a variety of meat/meat alternates (including non-
processed varieties), offered?
n When choices are not offered, are higher fat entrŽe items
limited to once a week?
n Are a variety of fruits, and vegetables offered daily, espe-
cially fresh fruits and vegetables?
n Are grains, including frequent servings of whole grains,
offered daily?
2. Evaluate how well the current menus meet the
appropriate nutrient standards.
n How do the menus compare to the nutrient standard for the
age/grade group(s)? What areas need changes? Which
areas are okay?
n Do the menus have sufficient calories, when averaged over
the week and on a daily basis? Compare each day — look for
daily menus that are out of line with the others.
¥If menus are insufficient in calories, can additional menu
items be added or portion sizes increased?
n Are the menus too high in total fat and/or saturated fat? If
so, evaluate menus for appropriate changes.
¥Review recipes for adjustments in fat and saturated fat
levels. Could a lower fat ingredient be exchanged for a
higher fat ingredient?
