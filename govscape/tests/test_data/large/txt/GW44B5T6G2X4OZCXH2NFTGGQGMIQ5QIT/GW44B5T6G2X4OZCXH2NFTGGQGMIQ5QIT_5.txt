The two-week window is defined as when the menu planner
becomes aware of the need to make a substitution. For exam-
ple, the two-week window is from the date the SFA is made
aware by a vendor that a food item will not be delivered to
schools. If a food item is shorted upon delivery to a school,
without notifying the central office, the two-week window
occurs whenever the school learns of failure to deliver. It is
recommended that SFA staff include Òimmediate notification
of inability to deliverÓ in the general conditions of the food bid.
Re-analysis Protocols:
n If the need for a substitution is known more than two weeks
before the menu date, or outside the two-week window:
¥Re-analyze; and
¥Meet the nutrient standards

Window
For the purposes of NSMP, a similar food will mean that the
substitution meets both the following criteria:
n Plays the same role in the meal, for example:
¥ Entree
¥ Other menu items (side dishes)
and
n Is from the same food group (breads, fruits, vegetables, etc).
Every effort should be made to substitute a like food within a
food group, i.e., a citrus fruit for a citrus fruit, a leafy green
vegetable for a leafy green vegetable, etc.
