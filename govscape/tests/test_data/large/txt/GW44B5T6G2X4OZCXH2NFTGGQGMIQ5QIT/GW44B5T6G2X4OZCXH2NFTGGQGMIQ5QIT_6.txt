Theme Bar Substitutions
When substitutions occur on a theme bar, the same rules
apply as for a regular lunch, that is, the two-week window
applies to substitutions of food items on a theme bar. If knowl-
edge of the need for a substitution occurs prior to two weeks
before the service of the menu, the recipe must be modified to
reflect the substituted ingredient and the modified recipe used
in the menu analysis. If the need for a substitution occurs
within the two-week window prior to the meal service, no re-
analysis is required; but the substituted item should be simi-
lar to the planned item.
Documentation of Substitutions
SFAs must document the date the need for the substitution
was known and what was substituted, so State agencies may
determine during an SMI review, if the SFA followed the
requirements for re-analysis based on the two-week window.
Some SFAs work out a system for having schools document
substitutions directly on the printed menus. SFAs may also
want to consider development of a substitution form for docu-
menting substitutions or using the sample substitution form
included in Apendix L.
