The substitution list should be maintained at the school level(s)
and at the central office. The central office would record
instances where notification was received from the supplier
that the food product would not be delivered to the schools.
Leftovers
Leftovers also can change the nutrient content so that meals
may no longer meet the nutrient standards if there are fre-
quent leftovers that are offered in subsequent menus. Menu
planners are reminded that NSLP regulations require schools
to consider participation trends in order to provide one reim-
bursable lunch for each child each day. Every effort should be
made to reduce the amount and frequency of leftovers. A chal-
lenge for schools is to make effective use of leftovers while
maintaining the integrity of the nutrient analysis.
Suggestions for Leftovers:
If the quality can be maintained, leftovers may be frozen and
used when the menu item is on the planned menu again. If
not, the leftovers may need to be served within the school
week by substituting for another menu item or may be used as
a substitute at a later date. The same two-week window rules
apply to leftovers as apply to substitutions.
Schools are cautioned that any leftover not frozen for reuse
should be discarded or used within a safe period. Bacteria con-
tinue to grow even under refrigeration.
Documentation of Leftovers
A simple way to document leftovers is to indicate the leftovers
directly on the menu production record or on a special form
such as the substitution form. Documentation should include
amount of leftover(s) such as number of servings, numbers of
pans, etc.; how leftover was dispensed (frozen for later use,
thrown away, served next day, etc.).
