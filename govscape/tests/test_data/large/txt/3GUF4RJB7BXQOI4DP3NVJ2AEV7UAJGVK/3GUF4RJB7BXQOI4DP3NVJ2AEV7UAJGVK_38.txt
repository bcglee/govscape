Review of USDA-APHIS Document:
“Movement of Commercially Packed Citrus Fruit from
Citrus Canker Disease Quarantine Area”
Introduction—History and Background
There have been a few different outbreaks of citrus canker (a
disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, or Xac for
short) in citrus-producing regions of the United States. The
earliest began around 1910 and was eradicated by 1943; the
second began in the mid-1990’s and was declared eradicated in
1994. Unfortunately, eradication, unlike extinction, is not
forever, and the disease reappeared in Florida in 1995, leading
to resumption of eradication efforts. In response to the
hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, the USDA recognized that
eradication was no longer a feasible goal, and put the entire
state of Florida under quarantine. The document I was asked to
review represents a shift in USDA’s focus from controlling citrus
canker at the level of individual groves to controlling it at the
level of the individual packinghouse, and summarizes available
evidence concerning the likelihood of establishment of new
citrus canker infestations outside of Florida in the other five
citrus-producing states (Hawaii, California, Arizona, Texas, and
Louisiana) due to transport of commercially-packed fresh
Florida citrus fruit. The document also uses a pathway-based
probabilistic risk assessment to examine five different proposed
regulatory scenarios. Although I reviewed the entire document,
the bulk of my critique will be focused on this probabilistic risk
assessment. I have formatted my review as answers to a set of
questions posed in the peer review notice and guidelines.
1. Does the analysis clearly characterize the potential,
or lack thereof, for commercially packed citrus fruit to
serve as a pathway for the introduction and/or
spread of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri?
The main conclusion of the document, based on a qualitative
risk assessment, is that the likelihood of introducing Xac into
previously canker-free areas via transport of commercially-
packed citrus fruit is extremely low. Several lines of evidence
converge to support this conclusion.

culling, and decontamination of harvesting equipment,
