Appendix A â€” Review #1
even if fruit distribution were unrestricted, I do not feel it would
greatly increase total risk. Commercial fruit is heavily graded to
remove any blemished fruit, not only for disease control
purposes, but also for cosmetic reasons. Thus, most fruit with
canker lesions would be graded out in any case. As pointed out
in the document, lesions on mature fruit are old and produce
relatively small amounts of inoculum and I consider any
epiphytic bacteria present to be an extremely remote possibility
as a source of inoculum. From a strictly pathological point of
view, removing all restrictions of commercial fruit would not
greatly increase the total risk of introduction of canker into new
areas for reasons stated above. Controlling 1% of the risk more
effectively does not diminish the total risk of introduction
greatly.
Option 2: Allow distribution of all types and varieties of
commercially packed citrus fruit to all U.S. States,
subject to packinghouse treatment with APHIS-approved
disinfectant and APHIS inspection of finished fruit for
citrus canker disease symptoms.
I support this option as being prudent and realistic. Any
commercial fruit shipped to citrus-producing states is unlikely
to result in the introduction of the disease into those states.
Currently, there is no effort being made to limit the movement
of illegal living citrus plants between states. Thus, the most
likely means of introduction would be by that means or possibly
by illegal movement of uninspected and untreated fruit.
Eliminating shipments of fruit to citrus-producing states would
not greatly reduce the potential movement of the disease. In
addition, it is highly unlikely that canker would become
established and become a production problem in California or
Arizona. Even though the possibility would be greater for Texas,
I doubt that canker would be a serious problem even there.
Canker could be serious in Louisiana, but introduction there is
much more likely on living plants moved from Florida than on
commercial fruit.
