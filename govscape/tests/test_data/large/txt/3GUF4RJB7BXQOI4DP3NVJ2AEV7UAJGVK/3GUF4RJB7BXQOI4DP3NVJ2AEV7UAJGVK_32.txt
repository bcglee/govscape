Appendix B â€” Review #2
3. Does the analysis accurately characterize the cited
literature?
Yes, the literature reviewed in the document is a
comprehensive collection of relevant literature on citrus canker,
and of those articles with which I was previously familiar, or
read in the course of my review of the document, the analysis
accurately characterizes their content and conclusions. I
suggest adding the article on leaf miner damage mentioned
above that appeared in Crop Protection just recently.
4. With regard to the methodology, is the approach and
process appropriate for the analysis?
Yes, the general approach of discussing the six main reasons
why previous analyses have concluded that there is a low
likelihood of introducing citrus canker through movement of
fruit is appropriate. That discussion then formed the basis for
accepting or rejecting the five different risk management
options, which was a logical approach. I liked the addition of
the quantitative model (Appendix 1) to determine the potential
quantity of symptomatic fruit shipped from Florida to other
citrus-producing states. I am not qualified to judge the
statistical accuracy of the model, but I was able to follow the
logic of its development and found it to be an appropriate
approach to help answer this risk assessment question. It is
based on real statistics of the amount of fruit shipped to citrus-
producing states, as well as data on the accuracy of inspection
protocols.
5. Are all important assumptions identified and
uncertainties clearly stated?
Yes, the document does a good job of identifying where
assumptions are made, based on lack of data, and limitations in
specific steps due to uncertainties are identified.
6. Is any part of the document difficult to read or
understand?
The document is generally very well organized and clearly
written. To improve it, I would suggest organizing Section 5 to
more closely reflect the wording that is used on page 7 for the
six main reasons why previous analyses have concluded that
there is a low likelihood of introducing citrus canker through
movement of fruit. The same wording for each numbered
