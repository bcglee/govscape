Background and
Objective
RTI International coordinated an external peer review of the
document Movement of Commercially Packed Citrus Fruit from
Citrus Canker Disease Quarantine Area, as requested by the
U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) under task order contract AG-6395-
C-07-0046, Task 1. The scientific document describes the
effectiveness of potential measures to prevent the spread of
citrus diseases from the state of Florida to other citrus-
producing regions. In this report, we present background
information about the peer review, describe the review process,
list key questions or the charge to the reviewers, and include
the three peer review reports.
The document under review evaluated available evidence
regarding the biology and epidemiology of Xanthomonas
axonopodis pv. citri (Xac) and the management of citrus canker
disease and determined that the introduction of Xac through
the movement of commercially packed fresh citrus fruit is
unlikely. The evidence is not currently sufficient to conclude
that fresh citrus fruit produced in a Xac-infested grove
absolutely cannot serve as a pathway for introducing Xac into
new areas. Furthermore, it is not possible to design an
operationally feasible system that ensures only uninfected fruit
moves from quarantined areas. Resource constraints and other
practical considerations make it difficult to implement a grove-
centered regulatory systems approach in Florida, so the
analysis evaluated several packinghouse-centered risk
management options for the interstate movement of fresh
commercially packed citrus fruit from regions with citrus canker
