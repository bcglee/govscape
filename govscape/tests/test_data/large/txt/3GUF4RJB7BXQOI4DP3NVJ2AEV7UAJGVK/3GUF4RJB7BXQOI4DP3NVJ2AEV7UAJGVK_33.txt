Citrus Canker Peer Review
reason should be copied and used as the headings for the
subsections in Section 5, just as one would do with the
objectives of a grant proposal and their subsequent use as
headings in the experimental section of a proposal. The worst
way to write a grant proposal is to present a list of objectives,
and then in the experimental section, use headings that reword
or change the objectives. Section 5 seemed a little bit like that.
The discussion of the quantitative model (Appendix 1) probably
should be brought into an earlier section of the document,
rather than waiting until the discussion of risk management
option 2 on page 31. The findings of the model are relevant to
the discussion of phytosanitary inspection in Section 5.2. There
it is concluded (on page 17) that “grading and inspection
procedures are effective in removing fruit with visible lesions.”
However, the model in Appendix 1 concludes that there is
potential for symptomatic fruit to be shipped to citrus-
producing states, even with inspection procedures in place. It
would be better to discuss the model results in Section 5.2, and
again in Section 6 (page 27), where a conclusion is made that
“APHIS concludes that a phytosanitary inspection at the
packinghouse is an effective measure to detect fruit with Xac
symptoms and reduce the likelihood that fruit with symptoms
are shipped.” That may be true, but the model in Appendix 1
suggests that some symptomatic fruit will likely still get
through and be shipped. As it is, this leaves conflicting
conclusions in different parts of the document. Even the
Executive Summary starts out with five bulleted conclusions
(page i) that appear to be in conflict with the predictions of the
model. I recommend discussing the model and its findings
within Section 5 and modifying the conclusions there and in the
executive summary to be consistent with those expressed in
discussion of the model, as in Section 7.2.
7. Were the quantitative methodologies used in this
assessment applied appropriately to achieve the
objectives of the inspection efficacy assessments?
Yes, as stated above, the quantitative model in Appendix 1
seemed like an appropriate approach to address the risk
assessment question of whether symptomatic fruit could be
shipped from Florida to other citrus-producing states, even with
phytosanitary inspection procedures in place, although I am not
qualified to judge the statistical accuracy of the model.
