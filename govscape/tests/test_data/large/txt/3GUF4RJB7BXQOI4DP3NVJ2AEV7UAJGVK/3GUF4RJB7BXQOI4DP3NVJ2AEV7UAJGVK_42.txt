Appendix C â€” Review #3
5. Are all the important assumptions identified and
uncertainties clearly stated?
The assumptions of the risk analysis are accurately and
comprehensively stated on pp. 52-53. The authors do a good
job of identifying remaining sources of uncertainty on p. 90;
none of the major uncertainties seems to influence the validity
of the overall conclusions.
6. Is any part of the document difficult to read or
understand?
Even with a minimal background in plant pathology, I found the
review of the literature on Xac and citrus production well-
written, concise, and easy to follow. I have a much more
extensive background in risk assessment and stochastic
modeling; the sections of the document that dealt with these
issues seemed logical and accurate to me, and were not difficult
to understand.
7. Were the quantitative methodologies used in this
assessment applied appropriately to achieve the
objectives of the inspection efficacy assessments?
The document does a very thorough job of using the results of
the risk assessment to justify the constant 1,000-fruit
inspection sample advocated. Although not directly relevant to
the stated aim of the risk assessment, this is, in my view, one
of its most significant results. I have a couple of criticisms of
the risk assessment.
1. The authors use graphs with a pseudo-perspective effect
(Figures 9-11 through 9-15) to present some of their
results. This goes against accepted practice for the
design of effective data graphics. Pseudo-perspective
bar charts such as Figure 9-12 make it difficult to
reference the top of each bar against the y-axis; it is
never clear for such graphs if it is the apparent front of
the bar or the apparent back of the bar which represents
the true height. Removing the pseudo-perspective, as in
Figure 9-19 makes the graph less cluttered and more
informative. Pseudo-perspective pie charts such as
Figure 9-13 have even more severe problems. The
foreshortening introduced by the pseudo-perspective
effect makes it nearly visually impossible to relate the
relative areas of the various slices of the pie to the
actual percentages they are supposed to represent.
These same results can be presented in a more
