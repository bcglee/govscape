Executive Summary
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires a peer
review for important scientific information to ensure the quality
of scientific and technical research and guide improvements in
draft scientific documents before federal agencies disseminate
them (OMB, 2004). The Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) is interested in conducting a peer review of the
document Movement of Commercially Packed Citrus Fruit from
Citrus Canker Disease Quarantine Area. This document
identifies and evaluates options for regulating the interstate
movement of fresh citrus fruit with the goal of reducing the
potential for Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac)
introduction and spread. APHIS requested RTI International’s
support for conducting a peer review conforming to OMB’s
guidelines (OMB, 2002; 2004) under their task order contract
(AG-6395-C-07-0046, Task 1).
RTI conducted the peer review according to the statement of
work. We identified and selected three experts to review the
citrus canker document:
(cid:131) Mark C. Anderson, New Mexico State University—an
expert in risk assessment
(cid:131) Donald A. Cooksey, University of California at
Riverside—an expert in phytobacteriology
(cid:131) L.W. “Pete” Timmer, University of Florida Citrus
Experiment Station—an expert in plant pathology
The reviews are included as Appendices A, B, and C.
The three reviewers agreed that the analysis presented in the
document clearly characterizes the potential of commercially
packed citrus fruit as a pathway for the introduction and spread
of citrus canker. Each reviewer identified additional areas to
