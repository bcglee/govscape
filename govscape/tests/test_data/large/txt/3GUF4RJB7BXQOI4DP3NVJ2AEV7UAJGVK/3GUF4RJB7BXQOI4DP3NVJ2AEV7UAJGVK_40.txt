Appendix C â€” Review #3
another potential establishment pathway. (This example also
shows how establishment pathways that are operationally
defined as separate may actually intersect. I do not consider
this omission a serious weakness in the document, because the
qualitative risk assessment indicates that this pathway may be
even less likely than establishment via direct contact with
commercially-packed fruit. I only mention this possibility to
show that there are many imaginable ways in which citrus
canker might become established.) In the same vein, are
organic citrus groves likely to be more at risk as potential
establishment sites than conventionally-tended citrus groves?
(Note that the choice of risk management Option 4 would make
this possibility relatively unimportant.) I would like to have
seen more on the implications of climatic differences in the
potential susceptibility of the other citrus-growing states to
novel Xac infestations, and the implications of these differences
for the risk management options considered. (For example,
could shipments to the other five citrus-producing states have
been considered separately as non-mutually-exclusive risk
management options?)
3. Does the analysis accurately characterize the cited
literature?
Since I am not familiar with the literature on plant pathology in
general, or on Xac in particular, I cannot comment on how
accurately or completely the document characterizes the
literature in that area. As far as the risk assessment is
concerned, the literature the authors cite is appropriate to the
methodology, and certainly reflects the current state of practice
in such risk assessments. In addition to the literature
resources, the authors use other methodological tools such as
mathematical theorems and approximations, and software
tools. These are also appropriate to the task and used in a
justifiable way.
4. With regards to the methodology, are the approach
and process appropriate for the analysis?
The purpose of the risk assessment and associated probability
model is to estimate the number of symptomatic citrus fruit
shipped from Florida to citrus-growing regions in the other five
citrus-producing states (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Louisiana,
and Texas). The model does not evaluate the likelihood of
actual Xac establishment. The conceptual model for the risk
