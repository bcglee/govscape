Citrus Canker Peer Review
as well as other factors such as decreasing plant tissue
susceptibility to wounds and infection with fruit
maturation, and low survival of epiphytic pathogens,
tend to lead to low per-grove levels of infestation. In
addition, most infected fruit are likely to be clearly
symptomatic and thus readily recognized and culled.
2. Culling and treatment practices, as well as APHIS
inspections, are effective at identifying and isolating
infected fruit at packing houses. Grading and inspection
remove most (but not all) symptomatic fruit, and
disinfection kills nearly all Xac on asymptomatic fruit.
3. Typical citrus shipping and storage conditions are likely
to lead to high mortality of any remaining epiphytic Xac
on commercially packed fruit.
4. Establishment of new Xac infestations from shipped fruit
is highly unlikely, and would depend on a practically
unknowable sequence of unlikely events. Xac in
sufficient amounts to establish a new local population
would need to encounter appropriate conditions of
temperature, humidity, and precipitation timing. These
pathogen inocula would also need to encounter and
infect host plant tissue that is either wounded or at an
appropriate growth stage.
5. Tangerines, while somewhat resistant to citrus canker
infection, are by no means immune to it.
6. In those few cases where the origins of new citrus
canker outbreaks are known or at least strongly
suspected, nursery stock has been the culprit. There are
no known cases of establishment of new citrus canker
outbreaks from fresh fruit, rinds, or seeds.
In general, except as noted in my answer to question (2)
below, I found these arguments convincing and well-supported
by the data.
2. Are the data or other evidence complete? If not,
please indicate significant references that should be
included.
Although I agree that the required sequence of events is
unlikely, Iâ€™m not yet convinced that sufficient thought has been
given to potential pathways for establishment of Xac in
previously canker-free areas due (perhaps indirectly) to
transport of commercially-packed fruit. For example, rinds from
commercially-packed fruit may be incorporated into compost,
which may then come into contact with citrus trees, providing
