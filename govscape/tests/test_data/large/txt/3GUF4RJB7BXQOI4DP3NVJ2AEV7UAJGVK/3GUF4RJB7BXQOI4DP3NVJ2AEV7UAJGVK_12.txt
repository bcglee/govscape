Section 2 â€” Description of Review Process
Second, we explained the scope of the review in terms of the
charge to the reviewers prepared by APHIS. RTI provided the
charge to the reviewers, asking them to provide potential
solutions to address their comments. The charge consists of
nine questions as described in Section 3.
Third, RTI communicated and clarified any questions the
reviewers had about the scope of the review or the document
itself. We communicated the progress and status of the review
to APHIS regularly and ensured that the reviewers were
meeting the objectives of the peer review. We also ensured
that the reviewers describe possible ways to address their
concerns instead of only describing the concerns.
Finally, we compiled the three reviews in a single report. We
include the original peer reviews as Appendices A, B, and C. To
maintain the integrity of the reviews, we present the reviews as
appendices to this report instead of consolidating the comments
by the charge questions. Each reviewer focused on different
aspects of the charge questions depending on his area of
expertise, and their reporting formats and writing styles also
differ. Therefore, reading each review separately can help
readers better understand their comments. We have corrected
minor typographical errors and slightly reformatted their
reports to ensure a minimum level of uniformity of presentation
in this report.
