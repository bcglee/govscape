Citrus Canker Peer Review
Option 3: Allow distribution of all types and varieties of
commercially packed citrus fruit (except tangerines) in
U.S. States except U.S. commercial citrus producing
States. Allow distribution of commercially packed
tangerines to all U.S. States including commercial citrus-
producing States. Require packinghouse treatment of all
such citrus fruit with APHIS-approved disinfectant and
APHIS inspection of finished fruit (all types and
varieties) for citrus canker disease symptoms.
This option represents a very minor difference in risk from the
previous one. Obviously, restricting movement of fruit to citrus-
producing states to tangerines would reduce the amount of fruit
moved and in that sense lower risk. However, with regard to
the type of citrus fruit moved, risks with tangerines might be
less than with a highly susceptible type such as grapefruit.
However, the difference between tangerines and some of the
more tolerant oranges, such as Valencias, would be minute.
From my perspective, this option would be complex to
implement and represent very minimal gain in terms of
reducing risk.
Option 4: Allow distribution of all types and varieties of
commercially packed citrus fruit in U.S. States except
U.S. commercial citrus-producing States and require
packinghouse treatment of citrus fruit with APHIS-
approved disinfectant and APHIS inspection of finished
fruit.
As pointed out above, I think restricting movement to non-
citrus states reduces risk relatively little. Since there is no
control exercised over illegal movement of citrus vegetative
material or fruit, restriction of movement of commercial fruit to
citrus-producing states accomplishes little.
Option 5: Leave the current regulations for the interstate
movement of citrus fruit from citrus canker disease
quarantined areas in place and unchanged.
In my opinion, it is difficult to support this option. Eventually
most or all Florida citrus groves will be infested with canker and
such a rule would, for all practical purposes, eliminate
production of fresh fruit in Florida. The economic impact of such
a decision would be great and the impact in terms of reducing
risks to other citrus states would be minimal.
However, that being the case, there is no justification for
restriction of imports of fresh fruit from international sources
where canker is present. That certainly will have a great impact
