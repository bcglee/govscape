Appendix C — Review #3
9. Is the logic behind the choice (or rejection) of risk
management options clearly stated and supported by
data and evidence presented?
In general, yes. Of the five risk management options
considered, options 1 and 5 are either straw men or endpoints
of the spectrum of possibilities, depending on one’s point of
view. Option 3 is excluded from further consideration because
of the review of published data. This leaves options 2 and 4. Of
these two options, option 4 is risk-averse, while option 2
implies tolerance for a very small, but essentially unknowable,
risk. The risk assessment itself isn’t really formulated in such a
way as to allow us to choose between options 2 and 4.
However, I consider this more a limitation of risk assessment in
general than a limitation of this particular risk assessment.
Summary
In general, I agree with the main conclusion of the document
that the likelihood of introducing Xac into previously canker-
free areas via transport of commercially-packed citrus fruit is
extremely low. I also agree that a quantitative estimate of this
probability would be nearly impossible to calculate. I found the
overall approach and the specific structure and computations of
the risk assessment to be appropriate and defensible. The
conclusions are well-supported by the data and the analyses.
However, I think the authors should still have put more effort
into delineating possible pathways involving fresh fruit by which
citrus canker might become established in previously canker-
free areas. I think this kind of analysis would provide the
following:
1. A starting point for possible future risk assessments.
2. An initial focus for (in my opinion badly-needed) public
education efforts to help prevent citrus canker from
establishing new infestations.
3. Possibly better ability to judge between risk
management options 2 and 4.
This also seems to be the appropriate place to emphasize that
the extension services of the other five citrus-growing states
need to be producing and promoting a vigorous program of
public education informing people of the danger, however small
it may be, of citrus canker establishment in their area, and of
things they can do to reduce the danger (like not discarding
orange rinds from their lunch in a citrus grove). Although I
