Citrus Canker Peer Review
assessment is a four-node non-branching pathway model. This
model has four parameters to be estimated from the available
data. They are:
1. The number of cartons of Florida citrus fruit of all
varieties shipped to other citrus-producing states per
shipping season. This was modeled as a set of Pert
distributions, one for each citrus type (oranges, lemons,
etc.) for each of the five other citrus-producing states.
2. The number of fruit per carton for each citrus fruit type.
This was modeled as a set of Pert distributions, one for
each citrus fruit type.
3. The proportion of all fruit shipped that is Xac-
symptomatic. The authors use a very nice probability
argument to show that this proportion is a beta-
distributed random variable (representing the apparent
prevalence of symptomatic fruit) divided by a Pert-
distributed random variable (representing the sensitivity
of inspections). This is the core of the authorsâ€™ argument
in favor of a fixed inspection sample of 1,000 fruit per
incoming lot, which seems quite reasonable and well-
supported.
4. The proportion of Xac-symptomatic fruit shipped to
citrus-growing regions of citrus-producing states. The
authors go through some fairly complex calculations to
try to account for both citrus-producing acreage within
citrus-producing counties, and the populations of citrus-
producing counties relative to the populations of the
whole state. The model also accounts for both backyard
fruit and commercially-grown fruit. The calculations
seem quite reasonable.
The risk assessment calculations involve clever but standard
applications of the central limit theorem and the Poisson
approximation to the binomial distribution. The calculations
were performed using standard software and yield results that
are mostly intuitive and completely interpretable. The authors
find that, at a constant sampling rate of 1,000 fruit per
incoming lot, which is readily achievable with current APHIS
staffing levels, at most a couple thousand symptomatic fruit
would be reaching citrus-growing areas of citrus-producing
states per shipping season, under risk management option 2,
which permits distribution of all types and varieties of
commercially packed citrus fruit from Florida to all U.S. states,
subject to packinghouse disinfection and APHIS inspection.
