Appendix B — Review #2
8. Do the data and the evidence support the range of
risk management options presented?
Yes, I think the five risk management options are logical ones
to consider, based on the discussion of previous risk
assessment analyses and data from the literature in Section 5.
9. Is the logic behind the choice (or rejection) of risk
management options clearly stated and supported by
data and evidence presented?
Yes, for Options 1–3. However, the logic presented for rejecting
Options 1–3 would seem to apply to Option 4. The analysis of
existing literature concludes that evidence is not currently
sufficient to prove that infected fruit cannot possibly serve as a
pathway for the introduction of Xac, and the quantitative
analysis in Appendix 1 estimates that symptomatic fruit may be
shipped from Florida to other states. On page 35, it is stated
that “APHIS staff cannot estimate the frequency of unreported
illegal movement of Florida citrus to citrus-producing states or
the proportion of reported illegal movement to total illegal
movement.” Using the logic applied to Options 1–3, this
uncertainty means that APHIS can not rule out that infected
fruit could reach citrus-producing states through illegal
movement of citrus from non-citrus producing states. In
accepting Option 4, the document states (page 35) that “Option
4 compensates for uncertainty in the rate of illegal fruit
movement by requiring a disinfectant treatment and
phytosanitary inspection in addition to the distribution
restriction.” This is no different from what Option 2 requires
(disinfectant treatment and phytosanitary inspection), but
Option 2 was rejected based on the prediction from the
Appendix 1 model that in spite of the treatments and
inspections, there is potential for infected fruit to be shipped
out of Florida. Unless I missed something, Option 4 presents no
additional mitigation to assure that infected fruit will not be
shipped out of Florida than Option 2 does. The only difference is
that under Option 4, movement to a citrus-producing state
would have to occur by illegal shipping, which does make it less
likely to occur than under Option 2, where infected fruit could
be shipped directly (legally) to citrus-producing states.
However, APHIS says they can not quantify the frequency of
such illegal shipments, so they have no quantitative reason to
reject this as a possibility. What if infected fruit is legally
