Appendix A â€” Review #1
commercial fruit. I realize this document deals with movement
of commercial fruit, but addressing other means of movement
would have put the risk involved in movement of commercial
fruit in proper perspective.
3. Does the analysis accurately characterize the cited
literature?
Virtually all of the relevant publications are covered in the
review and listed in the Literature Cited. Perhaps, there is
insufficient differentiation of complete studies with repeated
experiments published in refereed journals compared to those
reports of single experiments published in nonrefereed journals
or popular magazines. Most of the quotes used, however, as far
as I was able to determine accurately reflect the results of
studies or the opinions of the authors.
A few specific comments:
One point that should be included in the document is that the
windbreak study by Gottwald and Timmer (1995) was carried
out under nursery rather than grove conditions.
Documentation should be provided for the statement that
bacteria are killed when placed in an acid environment (p.19).
Another point that could be made is that waxing of fruit coats
any lesions present with a hydrophobic material that prevents
penetration of water which would greatly limit exudation of
bacteria from canker lesions and reduce risk from such sources.
I know of no references to document that statement, but it
seems like a reasonable point given what is known about
inoculum release from lesions.
There are several phases required to establish an exotic disease
in a new area. The introduction phase is covered in detail and
the establishment phase is well addressed. However, there is
perhaps inadequate coverage of the subsequent spread and
establishment of the disease and the development of a disease
problem. As pointed out in the document, canker has been
introduced into arid areas such as Yemen and Saudi Arabia and
become established. However, unless favorable conditions such
as frequent overhead irrigation are created artificially to
promote canker reproduction and spread, the disease would
never become a problem.
