Review of USDA-APHIS Document:
“Movement of Commercially Packed Citrus Fruit from
Citrus Canker Disease Quarantine Area”
Summary Evaluation
The document prepared by APHIS is very well done, logically
presented, and is easy to follow. It provides thorough coverage
of the biology of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Xac) and
citrus canker disease as well as the assessment of the risks
involved in movement of fruit from canker-infested areas. I
concur that commercially packed fresh fruit cannot be
completely eliminated as a potential source for infestation of
unaffected citrus areas. Nor would it be reasonable to expect
that movement of fruit from infested areas could be
accomplished while at the same time eliminating all risk of
transmission of the disease.
In my opinion, the analysis clearly characterizes the potential of
commercially packed citrus fruit as a pathway for the
introduction and spread of citrus canker. However, I feel that
the importance of commercial fruit as a means of introduction
is not put into proper perspective in relation to other possible
means by which canker could be introduced into new areas that
represent much greater risks. Most of the relevant information
has been presented and I know of no references of major
importance that have not been included. I am not an expert in
risk analysis, but that presentation appears to be logical and
appropriate. The proper assumptions have been identified and
the analysis seems to achieve the objectives laid out. The risk
management options are clearly stated and supported by the
evidence presented.
1. Does the analysis clearly characterize the potential,
or lack thereof, for commercially packed citrus fruit to
serve as a pathway for the introduction and/or
spread of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri?
For the most part, I think the potential of commercial fruit as a
pathway for introduction of canker is appropriately
characterized. However, in my opinion, the potential
importance of epiphytic populations that might remain on the
surface of fruit outside of lesions is given an inordinate amount
of importance. I realize that this is due to the fact that
