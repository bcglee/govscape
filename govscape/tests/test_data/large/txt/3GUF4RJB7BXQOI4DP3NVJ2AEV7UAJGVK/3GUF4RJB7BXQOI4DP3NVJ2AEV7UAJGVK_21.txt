Citrus Canker Peer Review
opponents of movement of commercial fruit have used the
survival of a few bacteria on the fruit surface to prove that all
risk cannot be eliminated. However, I think the skills of any
plant pathologist would be challenged if they were asked to
successfully inoculate and infect citrus plants from bacteria with
that source alone. In the absence of visible lesions on fruit and
assuming that normal packinghouse procedures were followed,
it would be extremely unlikely that enough bacteria would
remain by the time the fruit arrived at market to infect a citrus
plant. The really important point that is well covered is that Xac
is casual rather than a resident epiphyte and does not multiply
outside of lesions.

The only area that has not been addressed that seems to me to
be relevant is the risk involved in movement of citrus canker by
means other than commercially packed fruit. Canker can be
moved on living plant material, on fruit, budwood, and
vegetative materials brought in by growers, nurserymen,
hobbyists and tourists illegally and those means of entry are
the most likely method for introduction of canker and most
other exotic diseases. While I realize that such risks are not
easily quantifiable, some idea could be developed from
interceptions at ports of entry. Nearly everyone agrees that the
risk represented by commercial fruit is minimal. However, the
fact remains that no matter how low the risk, if enough fruit is
moved over enough years, eventually the disease will be
introduced and established to the extent permitted by the local
climate in all citrus areas.
Thus, I think that the important point is that the disease is far
more likely to be introduced by other means and that
commercial fruit is among the least probable means of
introduction. My feeling is that by exercising control over
commercial fruit that we are expending a large amount of time,
energy, and funds to control a relatively minor portion of the
risk. Some effort is being made to reduce illegal introduction
through ports of entry, but the fact is that many introductions
escape detection. Total risk would be reduced much more by
stricter enforcement of illegal introductions of infected
propagative material and fruit than by control of movement of
