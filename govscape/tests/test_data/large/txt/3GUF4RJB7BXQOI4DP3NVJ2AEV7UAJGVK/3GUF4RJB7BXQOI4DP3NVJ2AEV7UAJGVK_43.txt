Citrus Canker Peer Review
informative way in a simple pie chart, without any tilting
or even in a table. The SYSTAT Graphics1 manual
provides a good introduction to the general topic of
designing effective data graphics.
2. I would have liked to see more on the pros and cons of
the different risk management options in light of the
results of the risk assessment modeling effort. Option 1
was (rightly, I think) rejected due to the uncertain
evidence concerning commercially-packaged citrus fruit
as a pathway for introduction of citrus canker into new
areas. The data presented and synthesized in the report,
particularly in Section 5.5, effectively remove Option 3
from contention. Option 5’s position is weakened by a
clearly-presented feasibility argument. Although I agree
that such arguments are crucially important in policy
analyses, I would like to see more analysis to back up
the statement that a “packinghouse-based inspection
could ensure the same level of phytosanitary security as
the current grove certification approach” (Section 7.5).
Perhaps this analysis is in another document; still, any
analysis comparing a grove-based strategy with a
packinghouse-based strategy would have to reconcile
that comparison with the discussion of uncertainty
concerning the efficacy of grove inspections as
compared to packinghouse culling on p. 90.
8. Do the data and the evidence support the range of
risk management options presented?
In general, yes. However, as mentioned above in my answer to
question (2), I would like to have seen some discussion of the
how the climatic differences between the other five citrus-
producing states might have influenced decisions to allow or
prohibit shipments of commercially-packed citrus fruit to those
states individually. On the other hand, perhaps the authors
were required to consider only mutually-exclusive risk
management options; if that’s the case, this criticism is
irrelevant.
