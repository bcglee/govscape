Citrus Canker Peer Review
2. Are the data or other evidence complete? If not,
please indicate significant references that should be
included.
In general, the document is very complete in analyzing data
that exists in the literature. One topic that that was not covered
as thoroughly as it might have been was the subject of the
citrus leaf miner. As mentioned on pages 6 and 9, the citrus
leaf miner can provide wounds for infection by Xac, and leaf
miner wounds create a suitable microclimate for Xac
multiplication. In addition, it is pointed out that even highly
resistant cultivars and species of citrus can be infected by Xac if
leaf miner is present. However, the influence of the leaf miner
is not brought up again in the discussion of Sections 5.4 and
5.5 on environmental conditions required for Xac establishment
and host resistance. It is concluded (page 21 Summary) that
for citrus canker to establish in another citrus-producing state,
Xac must encounter an environment with a temperature,
relative humidity, and rain events that are conducive to
infection. While Florida-like environmental conditions are not
common in most of California, are such conditions necessary if
the leaf miner is common? Leaf miner populations have
increased considerably in recent years in southern and central
California (although low this year, probably due to a series of
hard freezes this past winter). Leaf miner damage also results
in lower inoculum thresholds being required for infection (Crop
Protection, 2007, 26:59-65). Xac can infect through leaf miner
wounds at considerably lower inoculum levels (as low as 101
cfu/ml) than the levels discussed on page 20 of the analysis
document. Thus, the conclusion based on review of the
literature, in both the Executive Summary (page i, 3rd bullet)
and on page 21, may need to be modified, if it is true that
significant levels of leaf miner could negate the requirement for
Florida-like environmental conditions.
Another consideration that is not mentioned is the citrus peel
miner (Marmara gulosa), which is a problem sporadically in
central California. I am not familiar with any literature
addressing whether damage to the fruit from the peel miner
can make citrus fruit more susceptible to Xac infection, but this
seems like another factor to consider in assessing whether
citrus canker infections are possible to occur in more arid
states.
