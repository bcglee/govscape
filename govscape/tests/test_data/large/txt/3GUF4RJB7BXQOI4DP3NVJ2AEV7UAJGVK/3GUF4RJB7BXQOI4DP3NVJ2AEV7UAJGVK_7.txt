Citrus Canker Peer Review
address in the analysis, for example, the impact of citrus leaf
minor, the risk involved in movement of citrus canker by means
other than commercially packed citrus fruit, and the
implications of climatic differences in the potential susceptibility
of other citrus-growing states to novel Xac infestations.
The three reviewers concurred that the methodology used was
appropriate for the analysis and that important assumptions
were identified and uncertainties clearly stated. The reviewers
agreed that the document was generally well organized and
clearly written. One reviewer offered suggestions for improving
the organization of the document.
One of the reviewers offered several criticisms of the risk
assessment, including the use of pseudo-perspective graphs to
present some of the results of the analysis and the lack of
information on the pros and cons of the different risk
management options in light of the risk assessment modeling
effort.
The three reviewers think that the five risk management
options presented were logical ones to consider given the
evidence available. Each reviewer also commented on the logic
behind the choice (or rejection) of the five risk management
options.
