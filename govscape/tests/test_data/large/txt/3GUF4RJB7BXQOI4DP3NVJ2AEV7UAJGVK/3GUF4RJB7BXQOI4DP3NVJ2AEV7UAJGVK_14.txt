on the specific questions listed below.1
1. Does the analysis clearly characterize the potential, or
lack thereof, for commercially packed citrus fruit to
serve as a pathway for the introduction and/or spread of
Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri?
2. Are the data or other evidence complete? If not, please
indicate significant references that should be included.
3. Does the analysis accurately characterize the cited
literature?
4. With regard to the methodology, is the approach and
process appropriate for the analysis?
5. Are all important assumptions identified and
uncertainties clearly stated?
6. Is any part of the document difficult to read or
understand?
7. Were the quantitative methodologies used in this
assessment applied appropriately to achieve the
objectives of the inspection efficacy assessments?
8. Do the data and the evidence support the range of risk
management options presented?
9. Is the logic behind the choice (or rejection) of risk
management options clearly stated and supported by
data and evidence presented?

nine specific questions. However, they kept the general comments
separate from the specific questions as per RTIâ€™s request.
