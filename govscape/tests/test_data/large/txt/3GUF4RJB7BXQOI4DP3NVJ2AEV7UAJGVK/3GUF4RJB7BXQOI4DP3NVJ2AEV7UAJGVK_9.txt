The analysis conducted by APHIS is scientifically important and
thus warrants an external peer review as per the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) (2004) guidelines. Peer review
is an important process that can help ensure that the quality of
scientific information meets the standards of the technical
community, and it can help strengthen and clarify the analysis.
APHIS requested RTI’s support in conducting a formal and
independent peer review conforming to OMB’s guidelines for
peer review and quality of information (OMB, 2002; 2004).
