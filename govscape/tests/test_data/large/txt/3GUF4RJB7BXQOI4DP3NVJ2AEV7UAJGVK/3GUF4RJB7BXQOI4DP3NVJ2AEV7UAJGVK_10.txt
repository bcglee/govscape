Description of
Review Process
RTI conducted the review process in accordance with OMB’s
guidelines (OMB, 2004). The review process consisted of
selecting the reviewers, explaining the scope of the review,
facilitating the review, and consolidating the reviews in a single
report.
First, we selected three peer reviewers based on their
expertise. We initially identified 20 potentially suitable
reviewers after understanding the background and objectives of
the peer review from APHIS. Subsequently, we finalized the list
to three reviewers based on their availability and the desired
overlap of expertise in the areas of risk assessment, plant
pathology, and phytobacteriology. We also considered conflict
of interest in the selection process.
We selected the following individuals to peer review the
document:
(cid:131) Mark C. Anderson, New Mexico State University—an
expert in risk assessment
(cid:131) Donald A. Cooksey, University of California at
Riverside—an expert in phytobacteriology
(cid:131) L.W. “Pete” Timmer, University of Florida Citrus
Experiment Station—an expert in plant pathology
Table 2-1 provides a brief description of each of the three peer
reviewers.
