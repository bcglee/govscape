Review of USDA-APHIS Document:
“Movement of Commercially Packed Citrus Fruit from
Citrus Canker Disease Quarantine Area”
1. Does the analysis clearly characterize the potential,
or lack thereof, for commercially packed citrus fruit to
serve as a pathway for the introduction and/or
spread of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri?
Yes, for the most part, the document contains a very thorough
and unbiased analysis of existing data on the potential for citrus
fruit to serve as a pathway for introduction of Xac. The
document is well organized to address this issue, through the
identification (on page 7) of six main reasons why previous
analyses (USDA 1995; Shubert et al., 1999b; USDA 2006) have
concluded that there is a low likelihood of introducing citrus
canker through movement of fruit. Each of these six reasons is
analyzed in detail, followed by summaries for each of the
reasons, with conclusions related to the likelihood of Xac being
found on fruit, surviving fruit inspection, cleaning, disinfection,
and storage, as well as the likelihood of inoculum on fruit
encountering favorable environmental conditions and
susceptible hosts.
Most of the analysis supports the idea that spread and
establishment of citrus canker through movement of fruit is
unlikely, but it also accurately recognizes that the bacterium
can be found on citrus fruit and could be carried to other states
on infested fruit. Therefore, the authors conclude logically that
this mode of transmission can not be ruled out completely. In
addition, a quantitative model was developed (Appendix 1) to
determine the potential quantity of symptomatic fruit shipped
from Florida to other citrus-producing states. That model
indicated that there is a potential for symptomatic fruit to be
shipped to other citrus-producing states, even with APHIS-
approved disinfectant treatments and mandatory packinghouse
phytosanitary inspections.
