1Table Definitions:
Air layering = rooting technique whereby an aerial stem is wounded in some fashion, then treated with rooting hormone and covered with moist sphagnum moss at the point of the wound. The moss
is held in place with a plastic wrap tied at both ends. Once roots develop, the stem is separated from the main plant and potted or planted.
Division = technique where the crown or base of a plant is divided up so that each section contains at least one shoot or shoot bud.
Dioecious = plant species with incomplete flowers (flowers with only male or female parts, not both) that are found on separate plants. Examples here are willow, Indian plum, and coyote brush.
Hardwood cutting = a piece of woody stem collected when the plant is dormant, normally in winter (after leaf fall and before bud swell for deciduous broadleaf shrubs). Current year (1 year old)
shoots are most commonly used, but older wood can be used for some species. Usually at least two stem nodes are included.
Heel = a small section or piece of older wood that is left attached to base of the cutting.
IBA = indole-3-butyric acid, a synthetic plant growth regulator or hormone that mimics natural auxin or IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) by stimulating root development and other plant responses.
Layering = encompasses several techniques, but generally refers to the rooting of a stem at the point it touches a moist surface or is buried under moist soil. The stem remains attached to the parent
plant until root development is judged sufficient. Layering can occur naturally as in the case of redosier dogwood, or as the result of a branch or shoot being held down on the ground by mechanical
means.
Live stake = a 30-36 inch long, sturdy stake made from a live, dormant branch or the main bole of a tree or shrub species that roots easily. The basal end is cut at an angle for easier insertion and the
top end is flat for tapping or “pounding”. Maintaining proper polarity and minimizing damage to the distal (top) end are important.
NAA = Naphthalene acetic acid, a synthetic plant growth regulator or hormone that mimics IAA.
Node = point along a stem or shoot where leaf and/or flower buds occur. Branch joints can also be considered nodes.
ppm = parts per million. Concentration of a chemical dissolved in a solution of water, alcohol or other solvent. Note that 1000 ppm equals a 0.1% solution, 5000 ppm equals 0.5% solution, etc.
Rhizome cutting = similar to a root cutting, but utilizes a piece of rhizome or lateral, underground stem from which shoots and roots naturally arise. Rhizome formation is synonymous with
suckering shrubs like common snowberry and Douglas spirea.
Root cutting = piece of fleshy root usually collected close to the main stem in winter. Root cuttings show polarity so the end closest the main stem is planted upright. Such cuttings are usually 1/16
to 1/4 inch in diameter and 3 to 4 inches long, or 3/8 to ½ inch in diameter and 1 ½ to 3 inches long. Method only works for species capable of forming adventitious shoots from roots.
Scarification = physically changing the surface characteristics, integrity, or thickness of a seed coat, typically by abrasion, acid treatment, or bacterial actions. Usually done to allow moisture uptake
by the seed and overcome physical dormancy.
Semi-hardwood cutting = (also known as greenwood cutting) a piece of woody stem collected from current years wood after expansion has ceased and the tissue has hardened (lignified) for the
summer.
Softwood cutting = piece of woody stem collected from newly expanded or actively growing shoot in spring.
Stratification = a period of warm moist or cold moist treatment of seed placed on or in a medium such as moist peat moss, sand, or paper. It allows for after ripening or other physiological
conditioning of the seed necessary to overcome dormancy. Cold moist stratification can often be achieved by fall sowing and overwintering the seed outdoors under natural conditons.
Whip = a very long cutting (3-6 ft) or unbranched stem that is inserted with at least ½ of its length below ground in order to reach the water table or zone of prolonged soil moisture.
