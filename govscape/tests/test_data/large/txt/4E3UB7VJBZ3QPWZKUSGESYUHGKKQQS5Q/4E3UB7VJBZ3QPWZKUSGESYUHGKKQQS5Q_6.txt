TMT = treatment: 1 = untreated. 2 = 5:1 dilution Wood's Rooting Compound (WRC). 3 = 10:1 dilution WRC. 4 = untreated w/ foliage intact. 5 = 5:1 dilution WRC w/ foliage intact.
GH = greenhouse. FD = field. PD = pond. Min. Caliper = minimum caliper which still rooted. Root Abundance based on scale of 1=best, 10=none.
2 yr Wood refers to root formation on second year wood: Yes or ? (unknown). Means with different letters are significantly different at P = .05.
Root Loc. refers to location of roots on the cutting: B(b) =basal. N(n) = nodal. I(i) = internodal. c = callus w/ roots. Upper case letters indicate predominant position of roots.
Overall rating: 1st letter refers to root amount. 2nd letter refers to rooting success. P = poor. F = fair. G = good. E = excellent. <> = data not taken or available.
** SASI roots readily from 2nd year growth (not evaluated here). *** SASI rooted readily in the FD and PD with WRC, but poorly in the GH due to toxcity.
