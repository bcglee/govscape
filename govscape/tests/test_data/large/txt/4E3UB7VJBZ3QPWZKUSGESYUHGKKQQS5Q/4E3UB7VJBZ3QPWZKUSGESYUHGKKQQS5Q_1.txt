In general, California hazel (Corylus cornuta var. californica), tall Oregon grape (Mahonia
aquifolium), blue elderberry (Sambucus cerulea), cascara (Rhamnus purshiana), thimbleberry (Rubus
parviflorus), and Oregon viburnum (Viburnum ellipticum) performed comparatively poorly and are not
recommended for direct sticking or soil bioengineering practices, regardless of hormone use, site
conditions, or soil drainage. However, for these species, a low or variable percentage of hardwood
cuttings may root in a controlled environment, such as a greenhouse mist bench, in combination with
special techniques. Additional studies are needed.
In addition to information on these 15 species, a summary of traditional vegetative and sexual propagation
techniques for Sitka alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata), vine maple (Acer circinatum), western redosier
dogwood (Cornus sericea ssp. occidentalis), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), Sitka willow (Salix
sitchensis), Pacific serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia var. semiintegrifolia) , and Douglas spirea
(Spiraea douglasii) are included in a supplemental table. The most effective propagation methods and the
potential of each species for direct sticking of cuttings, live stakes, and whips are described. However,
for all species listed, individual results can vary widely, even when using the recommended or “easy”
methods. Results depend on the health of the mother or donor plant, stock or seed quality, timing,
population or clone (genetics), handling and storage techniques, sanitation, pest management, site or
growing conditions, and skill level of the propagator or planting crew.
INTRODUCTION
In the Pacific Northwest USA, landscape horticulturists utilize native shrubs more than ever (Hamilton et.
al. 1998). Ecologists and erosion control specialists call on them almost exclusively over exotics for
wetland restoration and streambank stabilization, including widely accepted soil bioengineering practices.
To this end, propagation technology on regionally important species has increased within the past decade.
While methods for more common and ornamental native shrubs are now published (Kruckeberg 1996,
Leigh 1997, Rose et. al. 1998), additional refinement is needed for many species.
The most frequently used woody plants for stream side soil bioengineering in western Oregon and
western Washington are native willows (Salix spp.), and to a lesser extent western redosier dogwood
(Cornus sericea var. occidentalis) and Douglas spirea (Spiraea douglasii). The applicability of other
indigenous shrubs for practices such as unrooted live stakes, fascines (wattles), and brush mats is not
widely known. For example, how well will other species root from older wood or grow when buried as a
bundle (fascine) or a mat (brush mattress) along a streambank? In addition, could synthetic plant growth
regulators (PGRs) such as IBA (indole-3-butyric acid) be used to treat dormant cuttings or branches on-
site and enhance root development and establishment?
While some information exists on the relative ease of rooting hardwood cutting (Leigh 1997, King Co.
Dept. of Public Works 1993), rooting potential under various conditions, including the use of PGRs,
merits further exploration. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to screen 15 select, indigenous species
for their ability to root from hardwood cuttings with and without a rooting compound in a field, nursery
bed, greenhouse mist bench, and saturated soil (artificial pond).
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Selection and Sources: Native shrub species were chosen for the studies based on their relative ease of
rooting, natural abundance, or special features. Accession numbers, scientific names, and sources for all
material appears in Table 1. Branches were harvested in February 1998 and stored in a cooler (36°F)
until processed into cuttings. Healthy, vigorous plants were favored. The cultivar ‘Plumas’ sitka willow
was used as a standard of comparison. The full array of species and sources was used in the greenhouse
study, but lack of material for some species prohibited testing them under all experimental conditions.
