time. Differences in performance could be related to donor plant health, timing, handling and storage
techniques, genetics, growing conditions, sanitation, pest management, and the skill of the propagator.
These variables can and will substantially affect results regardless of the species in question.
As this work and the literature suggests, cascara, tall Oregon grape, Oregon viburnum and California
hazel are most effectively propagated by other means. Refer to Table 4. for a summary of vegetative and
sexual propagation techniques for 22 Pacific Northwest native shrub and trees species, including these.
FUTURE WORK
Future work should include evaluating how well the most favorable species root from 3-5 year old wood
or as live stakes, establish from horizontal bundles (fascines or wattles) or brush mattresses, and perform
when planted or installed at different times of the year (fall versus winter or early spring) using these
methods. For most shrubs tested, the efficacy of treating material with plant growth regulators under
difficult, on site conditions remains a question. Ultimately, the goal is to improve shrub rooting success
for growers and increase the number of indigenous species applicable to environmentally friendly soil
bioengineering practices or low cost methods like direct sticking and live staking. This will provide
further opportunity for revegetation and erosion control specialists to diversify plant communities and
restore wildlife habitat along streams, shorelines and wetlands.
