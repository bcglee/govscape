between and within rows. Each plot consisted of 6 cuttings at Corvallis, OR, and 15 cuttings at Bow, WA.
For the three outdoor studies, spacing was 6 inches within row and 24-30 inches between rows. The 12
inch cuttings for the outdoor studies were inserted 8 inches into the substrate (soil or sandy medium). All
plantings were made in late February or early March.
Management: Greenhouse day length was 16 hours and minimum night temperature was set at 65°F.
Temperatures exceeded 90°F on sunny days in May. Cuttings were misted 20 seconds/hour during the
day light and once at night. No tent, fertilizer, or bottom heat were used.
All outdoor plantings (nursery bed, farm field, pond) occurred in a firm, moist, weed free soil or substrate.
No fertilizer or irrigation water was applied to the field site at Corvallis. The pond substrate was not
fertilized, but was sub-irrigated for eight weeks to simulate saturated soil conditions typical of a stream
shoreline or seasonally flooded wetland. The field and pond sites were hand weeded once. At Bow, the
nursery bed was irrigated five times from March through June and weeded by hand. No herbicides or
fertilizers were applied to the bed.
Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection included caliper of cutting, minimum caliper that rooted,
length of longest shoot, number of live and dead shoots (not reported here), root length, root abundance
(actual root counts or visual rating based on 1 = highest and 10 = lowest or none), location or position of
root formation on the cutting [basal end (B,b), nodal (N,n), or internodal (I,i)], age of wood, and percent
rooting success. Material that had at least one live root was counted as successful, regardless of the
condition or existence of a healthy shoot. Data were collected once at the end of each experiment (after
approximately 14 weeks), except at Bow where data was collected after 10 and 14 weeks to gauge rate of
root development.
Each accession or species was treated as an individual experiment and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
conducted on Factor A (root treatment). The F test was used to compare two means and Fisher’s Protected
Least Significant Difference (FPLSD) was used to separate three or more means at the P=.05 level of
significance. Species means (species as a treatment) were not statistically analyzed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results for the nursery bed experiment are shown in Table 2., and those for the greenhouse mist
bench, upland field, and pond studies are shown in Table 3. All data represents the mean of four
replications. Means with the same letters are not statistically different at the P=.05 level. Groups of
means without letters are not statistically significant or were not statistically separated because of missing
values. Further definitions of codes and headings appear at the bottom of each table.
An overall rating (last column of Table 3) was assigned each species/treatment based on root abundance
(first letter) and percent of hardwood cuttings rooted (second letter). Performance in the pond (saturated
sand) was not factored in because of the extreme conditions. In general, the criteria for rating was applied
as follows:
Letter Rating Root Abundance Percent Rooted
Poor (P) 8-10 0-30
Fair (F) 5-8 30-50
Good (G) 2-5 50-90
Excellent (E) 1-2 90-100
