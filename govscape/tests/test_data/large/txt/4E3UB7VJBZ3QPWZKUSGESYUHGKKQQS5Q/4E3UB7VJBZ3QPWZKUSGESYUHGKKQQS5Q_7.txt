For all experiments, any consistent improvement in cutting performance from the use of Wood’s rooting
compound (WRC) was difficult to statistically detect for most species and data sets collected. However,
for both accessions of common snowberry, treatments always decreased the minimum caliper of cuttings
that successfully rooted and increased the number and abundance of roots, root length, and shoot length
by the end of the experiment (excluding pond data). Differences were not always statistically significant,
but the combined trends across all three experiments were consistent. When salmonberry was treated,
root abundance and shoot length were greater in the greenhouse and field, but root length was less in the
greenhouse. Red elderberry (in the field), coyote brush, and Indian plum (in the greenhouse)
demonstrated increased nodal rooting when treated with WRC, but not necessarily more roots.
Any detrimental effect from using WRC rooting compound is not obvious from the data except for
‘Plumas’ sitka willow in the greenhouse. Wherever the willow cuttings came in contact with the
solution their roots died, causing high mortality in the plots. In contrast, no similar negative response
occurred in the field or pond studies. Results for sitka willow in the nursery bed were mixed.
Red elderberry also demonstrated inconsistent tendencies. Treatments with WRC significantly
improved root abundance (and increased rooting percentage) in the field, but had no effect in the
greenhouse, and significantly reduced rooting percent at the 10:1 dilution level in the nursery bed. The
reasons for these discrepancies are unknown. Other research has shown the benefit of low concentrations
of IBA for this species (Table 4.).
The experiment using saturated (flooded) sandy substrate as a rooting medium in the pond provided very
different results. Sitka willow performed very well as expected and most other species did poorly or
completely failed to root and survive (Table 3.). However, common snowberry and black twinberry
were an exception, rooting at a rate of 50-54% and 96-100% respectively. This suggests that cuttings from
these two shrubs have greater tolerance to saturated conditions (at least for an initial two month period)
compared to other species. If so, they may be more appropriate than others for use as live stakes or
unrooted cuttings planted along the immediate shoreline of a stream or area with shallow ponding, but
further evaluation is needed.
Based on these studies, it appears that additional native shrubs (or at least certain clones or populations)
besides native willows, western redosier dogwood, and Douglas spirea have the potential to be planted
as hardwood cuttings directly on revegetation sites. This also suggests they may work as live stakes,
whips or other unrooted materials such as fascines and brush mattresses, but further testing is needed.
Those with the highest potential include black twinberry, common snowberry, Pacific ninebark, and
salmonberry. Species with fair potential are red elderberry and coyote brush. The utility of species
with variable results, like Indian plum, may improve with the use of vigorous shoots from healthy
cutting blocks or ecotype selection based on fast rooting clones.
Other species might be considered under limited, special, or ideal circumstances. For example, mock
orange remains a possibility for testing on stream sites as unrooted cuttings, live stakes, and fascines
because it rooted readily. Unfortunately, its roots did not penetrate a somewhat compacted silt loam soil.
It may be limited in use to moist or well watered, well drained, coarse textured soils. Despite fair
survival, red flowering currant appears marginal at best because it was relatively slow to root.
However, given its high ornamental and wildlife value, high density plantings of unrooted cuttings may
be worth the effort in benign environments with high quality, well drained soils and supplemental
irrigation.
Blue elderberry and thimbleberry rooted poorly (low root abundance and/or only poor to fair rooting
percentage) and slowly from hardwood cuttings, in contrast to good success in some reports (Leigh 1997).
Based on uncertain results, they are not recommended for direct sticking, live staking, or whips at this
