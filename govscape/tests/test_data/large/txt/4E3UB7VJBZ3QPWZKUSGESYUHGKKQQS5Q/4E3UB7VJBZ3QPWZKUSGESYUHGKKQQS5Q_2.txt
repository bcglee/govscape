Study Locations: Four study sites were chosen for the experiments to represent a variety of growing
conditions. They were an irrigated nursery bed (well drained sandy loam), a greenhouse mist bench
(perlite medium), an upland terrace (farm field, moderately well drained silt loam), and an artificial pond
(saturated sandy substrate). The nursery bed was located at the Lynn A. Brown (Bow) Plant Materials
Center (elevation 200 ft.) operated by the Washington State Association of Conservation Districts, and the
other three sites were at the NRCS Plant Materials Center, Corvallis, OR (elevation 225 ft.).
Processing: Stems were cut into 8 and 12 inch segments for the greenhouse and three outdoor studies
respectively. Branches were fully dormant except for early bud swell in red elderberry, Indian plum,
red flowering currant, and black twinberry. For consistency among species, apical buds were removed
(except for a portion of species at Bow, WA), previous year’s growth (1 year wood) was used unless
second year wood was required for adequate material, side branches, if any, were removed (except for
coyote brush), and stock quality was randomized among all plots. A further exception was made for blue
elderberry and red elderberry. For these species, the standardized lengths were occasionally exceeded
in order to insure two nodes per cutting.
Cuttings were left untreated (control) or dipped for five seconds with Wood’s rooting compound (WRC:
1.03% Indole-3-butyric acid, 0.51% 1 Naphthalene acetic acid, 78.46% Ethanol SD 3A, and 20%
Dimethyl formamide, by weight) diluted with water at a ratio of 5:1 or 10:1 (H 0:WRC). At Corvallis,

the two broadleaf evergreens, tall Oregon grape and coyote brush, were further divided into treatments
with and without foliage (leaves intact or clipped off).
Experimental Design and Planting: The design was a randomized complete block with four replications
and two, three, or four treatments depending on the species (control plus one or two dilutions of WRC,
and control plus foliage intact versus no foliage, with and without WRC at 5:1). For the greenhouse mist
bench study, 8 inch cuttings were inserted to a depth of 5 inches in moist perlite. Spacing was 2 inches
