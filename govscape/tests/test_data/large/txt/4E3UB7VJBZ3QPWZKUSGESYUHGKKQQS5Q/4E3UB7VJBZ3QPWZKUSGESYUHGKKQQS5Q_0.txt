Ability of Pacific Northwest Native Shrubs to Root from Hardwood
Cuttings (with Summary of Propagation Methods for 22 Species)

SUMMARY
There is a need for additional information on how well native shrubs root from hardwood cuttings. First,
nurseries are seeking to refine vegetative propagation techniques. Second, practitioners in the fields of
riparian/wetland restoration and streambank stabilization are looking for species that are easy to root from
unrooted dormant material that will provide cost competitive alternatives to native willows (Salix spp.)
and redosier dogwood (Cornus sericea) for direct sticking of cuttings and soil bioengineering practices.
The purpose of this work was to screen 15 shrubs indigenous to the Pacific Northwest USA for their
ability to root from hardwood cuttings with and without a rooting compound in a greenhouse mist bench,
well drained field, nursery bed, and saturated substrate (artificial pond).
If a species roots easily, it has greater potential for planting as dormant cuttings, live stakes, or whips
directly on a revegetation site, and may warrant further evaluation for fascines, brush mattresses, or other
soil bioengineering practices. Based on the rooting ability of hardwood cuttings made from 1 (or 2) year
old wood, those species with good potential include black twinberry (Lonicera involucrata),
salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), and Pacific ninebark
(Physocarpus capitatus). Coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis) and red elderberry (Sambucus racemosa)
have fair potential. Indian plum (Oemlaria cerasiformis), mock orange (Philadelphus lewisii), and red
flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum) may apply under limited circumstances, select uses, or ideal
conditions. Results from the outdoor field planting were generally similar to those from the greenhouse
mist bench study for all 15 species. When a rooting hormone (plant growth regulator) was applied, there
were seldom any statistically significant increases in rooting percentage, root abundance, root length, or
shoot length by dipping cuttings in a dilute solution of IBA/NAA. However, there were exceptions as
with snowberry, suggesting improvements may be possible for some species. Further refinements and
evaluations are needed.
Results for the rooting trial in the pond were substantially different. Under saturated soil conditions,
cuttings of Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis) rooted well, while those from most other species died or did
poorly. However, common snowberry and black twinberry rooted at 96-100% and 50-54%
respectively. Therefore, like many willows, these two species may have potential for direct sticking or
live staking along the immediate shoreline of streams or on temporarily ponded sites, in addition to moist,
well drained soils.
