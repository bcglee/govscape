days after seeding was 57 and 18% for the deep and shallow soil mulch
treatments. Seed zone moisture is very important for timely seeding and
emergence which fosters crop establishment, soil erosion control, and high
yields.
Models to predict heat and water fluxes for the critical points in the two-
year wheat-fallow sequence are beginning to be developed. A model to
predict winter wheat emergence was proposed by Lindstrom et al. (1976).
This model used soil temperature, water potential in the seed zone, and
planting depth. Wheat emergence predictions were reasonably good but
differences in varietal response to water potential were noted. Later, a
numerical model was developed to investigate the dynamic aspects of heat and
water flow in the upper soil layers with emphasis on the effects of
conventional and no-till fallow on these processes and ultimately on seed
zone water content (Hammel et al., 1981). This model should be further
developed for the many soil-climatic areas in the Inland Pacific Northwest
because adequate seed zone moisture in fallow is essential for good stand
establishment, erosion control, and profitable wheat production.
Evaporative water loss for chemical no-till fallow over a 90-day simulation
period using measured meteorological inputs was 70% greater than for
conventional tilled fallow. Resultant water content in the seed zone was
too low for successful stand establishment in the chemical fallow. Thus,
for southeastern Washington, some tillage appears necessary for retention of
adequate seed zone water for successful early winter wheat establishment.
A simulation model suitable for describing the dynamic aspects of water and
energy transfer in a surface residue-soil system was developed and used to
determine soil heat and water budgets and their effect on the decomposition
rates of surface and incorporated residues (Bristow, 1983). The residue
loading rate was 2700 pounds per acre which formed a layer 0.4 inch thick
and yielded an area index (projected area of residue per unit soil area) of
1. For Pullman, Washington conditions, surface residues decreased
evaporation roughly 30% when compared to bare soil. Monthly trends,
however, indicated that surface residues could enhance water loss during
long periods without rain. This is an agreement with Pikul et al. (1985)
who reported September and October evaporation rates of 0.006 inch per day
for northcentral Oregon when there were no late season rains to consolidate
the 2 inch thick residue-soil layer consisting of a dry mixture of straw
soil aggregates, and primary soil particles. Evaporation rates during a dry
year were generally one-third of the evaporation measured during a wet year.
Rains that consolidated- this residue soil layer caused the water
conservation benefits of soil mulch to disappear. Soil water evaporation
rates did not decline as potential evaporation declined during August
through November. Further detailed modeling of water exchanges as related
to soil heat flux are needed before we can accurately predict seed zone
water at seeding time. Improved grain drill openers could enhance use of
marginal seed zone water by placing the seed in the optimum moisture zone
for early germination, emergence and growth (Wilkins et al., 1983). Noori
et al. (1985) report that injection of small quantities of water with the
seed when seeding into seedbeds with marginal seedzone water increased plant
emergence and final yield that gave significant economic returns.
