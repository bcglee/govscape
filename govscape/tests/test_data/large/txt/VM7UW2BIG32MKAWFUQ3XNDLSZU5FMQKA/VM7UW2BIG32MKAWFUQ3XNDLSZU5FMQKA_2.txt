Table 1. Fall chiseling and antecedent water effects on overwinter runoff
and water storage at Albion, Idaho, during the winter of 1984-85;
a winter of above average precipitation, mostly as snow, and non-
frozen soils.

in the soil profile compared to the chiseled only treatment. The increase
in runoff (2.9 inches) was almost equivalent to the fall irrigation.
Absence of frozen soil beneath the snow cover resulted in similar runoff and
water storage when comparing the standing stubble and chiseled stubble
treatments. In most years the soil freezes and fall chiseling wheat stubble
increases soil water storage during the winter significantly. In this year
all three treatments had stored about equal quantities of water in the 8-
foot-soil profile by spring.
A similar antecedent water condition sometimes occurs where erosion has
depleted soil fertility so that associated reduction in crop growth fails to
deplete water stored in the soil profile (Massee and Waggoner, 1985). Where
six inches of topsoil was mechanically removed to simulate erosion, 1.2
inches less stored water was removed by the crop than on adjacent normal
soil. During the subsequent winter an identical 1.2 inches less water was
stored by the eroded soil so both soils finished the storage period with
equal amounts of stored water.
At Pendleton, Oregon, soil under standing wheat stubble stored 87% of
overwinter precipitation. Only 64% of precipitation was stored in soil
where stubble had been fall plowed (Ramig and Ekin, 1978). This amounted to
an additional 2.6 inches of water which increased green pea (Pisum sativum
L.) production 25% or 600 lbs/acre. The value of stubble on storage of
precipitation the first winter after harvest for fallow in three
precipitation zones in northcentral Oregon is presented in Table 2 (Ramig
and Ekin, 1984). Average weights of residue at the Ione, Moro, and
Pendleton locations were estimated at 4000, 6000, and 9000 lbs/acre,
respectively. Stubble increased soil water storage efficiency significantly
compared to burned stubble, but differences between flailed and standing
stubble were less than seven percent and insignificant.
