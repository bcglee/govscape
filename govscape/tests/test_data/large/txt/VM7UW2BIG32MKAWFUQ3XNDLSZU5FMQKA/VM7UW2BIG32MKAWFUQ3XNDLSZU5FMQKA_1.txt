DISCUSSION
Crop Residues impact snow trapping, soil freezing, and water evaporation.
We often do not recognize the importance of standing residues in catching
and maintaining uniform snow cover. The effects are several. First,
precipitation is more uniformly maintained over fields, by reducing snow
drift and providing increased uniformity of stored water for plant use.
Second, soil freezing is reduced significantly beneath a few inches of snow.
Freezing frequently reduces water infiltration and causes runoff, flooding,
and crop water loss. Third, recent evidence shows that freezing breaks
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) roots reducing root vigor and enhancing
susceptibility to disease entry.
Standing stubble also can help prevent freezing of the soil surface during
late winter diurnal freezing and thawing cycles after snow cover has melted.
Pikul and Allmaras (1985), at Pendleton, Oregon, found that frost penetrated
a bare soil surface 0.6 inch but did not form at the soil surface in
standing stubble. Upward water migration to this frost zone increased water
content in the bare soil surface where it was susceptible to loss by
evaporation during and after thawing. During one 24-hour period, water loss
from the top 4.3 inches of bare and stubble-covered soil was 0.09 and 0.01
inch respectively. Conservation tillage systems that leave standing stubble
which traps snow alter the plant microenvironment sufficiently that winter
wheat now is being grown successfully where only lower yielding spring wheat
has been traditionally grown in the Northern Plains. This change from
spring to fall planting along with increased soil moisture has increased
average yields significantly and even allowed annual cropping in some
instances where fallow is common practice. Residues also virtually
eliminated wind erosion (Hayes, 1985). Similar benefits can be expected in
the Pacific Northwest.
Residues alter the soil microenvironment throughout the year. They reduce
radiation and wind velocity at the soil surface. Less heat, therefore,
enters the soil and less water evaporates from cool, wind-protected soils.
The cool soils delay plant growth, but the additional stored water increase
crop productivity.
Untilled soils tend to reconsolidate and crust from precipitation and
traffic. Crusted, wet, or frozen soil surfaces often restrict infiltration.
Thus, no-till methods frequently have more runoff than conservation tillage
methods that have at least light surface tillage (Johnson et al., 1984).
Crusting problems tend to decrease after several years of conservation
tillage because surface organic matter and biological activity increases and
tilth improves.
Data presented in Table 1 from research near Albion, Idaho, in the Eastern
Idaho Plateau reveal the effect of antecedent water on overwinter runoff and
soil water storage (Massee, unpublished data). The silt loam soils in this
area have little structure, are low in organic matter, and usually freeze
every winter. Precipitation during the winter of 1984-85 was 13.4 inches;
150% of the longtime average. Much of the precipitation occurred as snow
that insulated the soil from freezing. Antecedent water in the chiseled and
irrigated (3.5 inches) treatment increased runoff and reduced water storage
