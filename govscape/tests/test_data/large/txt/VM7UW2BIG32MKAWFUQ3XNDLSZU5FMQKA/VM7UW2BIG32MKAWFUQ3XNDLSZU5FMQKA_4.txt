three residue treatments in eastern Washington (Saxton, unpublished data).
These data show that for the two years reported, winter water storage
increased where tillage (paraplow) improved infiltration and where residue
was left standing to trap snow and reduce evaporation. The paraplow loosens
consolidated soil surface layers yet leaves virtually all residues upright
on the surface. The soil surface is only slightly roughened and can readily
be direct seeded without intervening tillage. Flailed residues formed a mat
on the soil surface but were not erect to trap blowing snow. For
comparison, plots denuded of surface residues by burning stored the least
water. Burning is shown to be a poor practice for water conservation and in
addition causes a loss of organic matter and nutrients.
