Precipitation at La Crosse, WA, 10 miles south of Winona was:
Nov. 23, 1983 to April 4, 1984 - 7.6 inches
Oct. 2, 1984 to April 2, 1985 - 9.2 inches
Fall chiseling is practiced in areas where soil freezing is common or weed
growth occurs after wheat harvest (Papendick and Miller, 1977). Chiseling
is usually to a depth of 8 to 12 inches with narrow, pointed chisels spaced
12 to. 24 inches apart. Chiseling improves water infiltration in soils
having a compacted layer (Allmaras et al., 1977; Allmaras et al., 1982) and
unfrozen chisel grooves when the soil surface is frozen. In southeastern
Idaho, post-harvest chiseling increased overwinter water storage in 6 out of
10 years by 1.5 to 2.5 inches over no fall tillage (Massee and Siddoway,
1969; Massee and Siddoway, 1970). In eastern Washington, fall chiseling to
a depth of 9.8 inches increased overwinter water storage 3.4 inches compared
with no-tillage in a winter with frequent soil freezing (Lindstrom et al.,
1974). Water storage efficiency was 87% with chiseling and 50% with no-
tillage. In a mild winter with little soil freezing there was no difference
in water storage between the treatments. In north central Oregon, post-
harvest chiseling to a depth of 14 inches with narrow chisels spaced two
feet apart increased overwinter water storage 1.5 inches compared with no-
tillage only once in ten years (Ramig, unpublished data). Chiseling has
increasingly replaced moldboard plowing as the initial tillage in zones of
high precipitation or high frequency of frozen soil because of enhanced
water storage. Where annual precipitation is 12 inches or less and little
or no frozen soil occurs, fall chiseling has decreased storage when compared
with no-tillage.
Slot mulching is a new conservation tillage practice that gives evidence of
increased water confinement and infiltration. Slot-mulching involves
compacting part of the crop residues into a narrow continuous slot 2 to 4
inches wide by 8 to 10 inches deep. Ideally, the slots should be on the
contour and spaced 12 to 24 feet. Surface runoff is readily intercepted and
infiltrated by these open mulched slots. The remaining standing residues
pose little problem to subsequent tillage and provide good snow
