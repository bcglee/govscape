Data are the average of 4 years.
At Tetonia, Idaho, in the Eastern Idaho Plateau, Massee and McKay (1979),
reported that soil under standing stubble stored 4.6 inches more water than
where stubble had been burned in the fall. Tetonia is at an elevation of
6200 feet and much of the precipitation occurs as drifting snow. Winter
wheat yields were increased 5 bushels per acre for each foot of trapped
snow.
Conservation Tillage Systems uniquely affect the soil and residues. Tillage
implements that bury a minimum of residue and preferably leave the residue
standing to trap snow are recommended where residue-borne crop diseases are
not a problem. Residues on the soil surface are generally beneficial.
Table 3 shows example measurements of residues remaining following one pass
with specific tillage implements. The chisel plow, light field cultivator,
and paraplow leave the most residue on the surface.
Water conservation with selected tillage and residue management systems is
presented in Tables 4 and 5. The combined effects of snow trapping,
improved infiltration, and evaporation control are evident. The data in
Table 4 are from cropland in eastern Nebraska where the Great Plains type
annual precipitation averaged 27.6 inches and the 7 month winter
precipitation was 9.1 inches. Data in Table 5 are for two tillages and
