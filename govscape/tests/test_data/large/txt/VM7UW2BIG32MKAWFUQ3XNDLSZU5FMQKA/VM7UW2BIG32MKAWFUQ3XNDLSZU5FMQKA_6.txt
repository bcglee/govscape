trapping and evaporation reduction. During a snowmelt period in 1979, slot-
mulched treatments had 90% less runoff and 98% less soil erosion than no-
tilled plots or conventionally-tilled plots (Saxton et al., 1981). Detailed
measurements and calculations have confirmed a high infiltration potential
for mulched slots (Redinger et al., 1984).
Fallow. The water conservation period in a fallow-wheat rotation was
divided into three segments in a study in northcentral Oregon (Ramig and
Ekin, 1984). The fallow-winter segment was from August 1 after wheat
harvest through February 28 when water conservation ceased until the next
winter after seeding. When stubble was flailed or left standing after
harvest, over 70% of the fallow-winter precipitation was stored in the soil
profile at two locations in northcentral Oregon (Table 6). Only 60% was
stored where the stubble was burned.

rotation on water storage efficiency for three segments of the
fallow period in northcentral Oregon. Data are averaged for two
locations and four years.

The fallow-summer segment was the eight months from March 1 through October
31. All treatments were sprayed to control weeds in early March, tilled
with sweeps, and rodweeded as needed to control weeds during this period.
No additional water was stored during this period because of long, hot, dry
summers and stirring of soil by cultivation. An equivalent of all or 100%
of the summer rainfall, which project from 2 to 9 inches, was lost by
evaporation plus some water from the surface 8 inches of the tilled fallow.
Soil profiles that had the greatest amounts of stored water in the spring
lost the greatest amount during the summer. Lindstrom et al. (1974) have
reported similar over-summer losses of precipitation and water from fallow
in Washington. Wheat normally was seeded in late September or early
October.
After seeding, about 55% of the precipitation that occurred during the
November 1 through February 28 crop-winter segment was stored. Storage
