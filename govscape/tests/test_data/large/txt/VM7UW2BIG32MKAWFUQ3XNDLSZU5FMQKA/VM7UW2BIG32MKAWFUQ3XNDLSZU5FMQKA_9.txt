SUMMARY
Efficient water conservation during the first winter after harvest is
favored in the Pacific Northwest by dry soils and cool, wet winters.
Additional research with slot mulching and fall paraplow tillage may develop
water conservation systems that will replace fallow as a means for
profitable agriculture in many areas. In low precipitation zones, where
fallow is necessary, research is needed on systems that reduce summer
evaporation losses so some water may be stored during the summer. This will
be a difficult task in light of the physical laws controlling evaporation.
However, even slight progress would enhance water storage efficiency.
Probably the time for improved water conservation in wheat-fallow systems is
the winter after the crop is seeded. No-till (chemical fallow) needs
further research to determine whether good seed zone water can be maintained
until planting time. Injection of small quantities of water into seedzones
of marginal soil moisture content when seeding wheat has increased rate,
final stands and yields and warrants further testing to determine
feasibility on field scale. Standing residues could trap snow and reduce
evaporation to store more water, but may reduce tillering and resultant
production (Wilkins et al., 1984). If tillage is found necessary for
adequate seed zone water to establish cereal crops, research into
mechanically placed dams or dikes in deep furrow rows planted on the contour
may well increase present 50% water storage efficiencies and reduce erosion.
