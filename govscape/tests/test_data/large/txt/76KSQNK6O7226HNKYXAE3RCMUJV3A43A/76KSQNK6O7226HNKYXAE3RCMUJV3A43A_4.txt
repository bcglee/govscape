Project COPMC-S-0402-WL
Project Report 2006
By Steve Parr
Another disturbing result this year was the very low Pure Live Seed component in each of the
four harvests, (see included seed test results). The muttongrass, for example, had a purity
analysis of 93.63 percent, but only 20 percent germination.

CONCLUSION
UCEPC will continue to produce seed through 2007 of the fields established in 2004 if this is
agreeable with the Uncompahgre Technical Committee. At this time, it has not been determined
by the committee which, if any, of the materials will continue to be produced through time.
However, it is anticipated that other materials will be planted and the size of the established
fields may be expanded to increase the amount of seed produced and delivered to UP growers.
Verbally, it has been noted that a formal agreement between UCEPC and the PLP will be
drafted. In 2002, UCEPC received a $50,000 contribution from the UP committee for the
initiation of work on the project. After two years of collections and three years of production, a
new agreement is necessary to extend the project. In 2006, there was $2085 of the original
amount remaining from which UCEPC drew funds, with a balance of $9898. This was invoiced
in December 2006.
