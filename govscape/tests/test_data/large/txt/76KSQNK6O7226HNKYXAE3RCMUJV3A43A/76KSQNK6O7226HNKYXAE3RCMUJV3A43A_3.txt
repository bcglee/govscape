After harvest, the Senecio plants went dormant, which is not unusual for cool season materials.
However, with time, even the leaves dried up and became decadent. Upon further observation, it
was apparent that many of the plants were dead or dying. Bob Hammon, Colorado State
University Extension Agent and area entomologist, was summoned for assistance with diagnosis
of any insect or fungal pest problems that may have had an effect on plant mortality.
With further assistance from Laura Pottorff, three fungal pathogens were isolated from the
Senecio samples Bob provided and could be the cause of both root rot and crown rot. The two
species, Colletotrichum spp. and Pythium spp., were considered most suspect for causing harm to
the plants while the third isolated pathogen, Fusarium, was largely disregarded as being a
primary concern.
It appeared that over 70 percent of the field was dead from an observation made in September.
However, there were some “volunteer” plants showing up that may warrant further observation
before removing the field.
One reference indicated that the species may be a “short lived perennial, or a biennial or winter
annual”. This characteristic could further explain the behavior of the plant after seed harvest.
Although the plugs were planted in 2005, they did not produce flowers until 2006. In this regard,
the plants behaved at UCEPC much like a biennial. The identified pathogens may have infected
already weak or dying plants.
