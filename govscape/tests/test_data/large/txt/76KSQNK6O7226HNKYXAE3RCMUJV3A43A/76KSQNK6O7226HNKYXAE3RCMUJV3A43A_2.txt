Project COPMC-S-0402-WL
Project Report 2006

Plantings
The project plans had originally called for the use of seed from collections rather than
greenhouse grown stock. However, region wide drought conditions did not provide good
collectible populations of target materials. Steve Monsen, Native Plant Coordinator for the UP
Project, provided seed to greenhouses for container production. In 2004, three species were
provided to UCPEC for field increase as containerized stock. These materials were placed in
production fields with the use of two Holland Old Faithful model transplanters. On June 16,
2004, a crew of eight people planted six rows (0.2 acre) of yarrow plugs that were grown in cone
type containers. The crew started preparing the plugs for planting at 10:30 a.m. and by 3:30 p.m.
the yarrow transplanting was done. The following day, 0.27 acre of muttongrass was
transplanted by 12:30 p.m. and on June 18, 0.27 acre of Junegrass was done. A crew of seven
transplanted the muttongrass and six people transplanted the Junegrass.
Two transplanters were placed on a toolbar, each with seating for two. This allowed four people
to transplant into two rows, alternating the placement of plugs. Depth adjustments were made on
the planting shoe for the size of the rooted stock. As the shoe opened the furrow, the plugs were
placed at a slight angle in the furrow, held in place until the packer wheels approached the
planting spot, and then released as the packer wheels pressed the soil around the plug. The
second person would have the next plug in place while the first person closely observed and
adjusted the placement of the plug being planted. Alternating in this way with two people
planting per row provided excellent placement. Two people followed on foot, one for each row,
to adjust planting depths on the transplants as necessary. Hand move sprinklers were set
immediately after the plantings were completed each day. Survival and stand establishment were
excellent on all three products utilizing these methods. In 2005, an additional material was
planted in UCEPC Field 3A. Approximately 1800 “Conetainer” type transplants of Senecio
multilobatus were planted the first of July in the same manner the other materials were planted.
Harvests
Each product was harvested with the Hege plot combine in 2005 and 2006. In addition to direct
combining, a tarp was attached to the back of the combine such that the straw and chaff that
exited off the straw walkers would be captured. This material was then transported to a
straw/seed drying area for further seed recovery. After the material was dry, it was run through
the Hege combine repeatedly until no additional appreciable seed recovery was obtained.
RESULTS
On November 2, 2004, forty-three clean grams of UP yarrow were hand collected. This
represents the first field produced seed by UCEPC for this project. Each field established in
2004 produced seed in 2005 and 2006. The Senecio field, established in 2005, also produced
seed in 2006.
