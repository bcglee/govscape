Seed Increase for Uncompahgre Restoration Project
INTRODUCTION
Years of noticeable mule deer declines in areas that once held healthy populations prompted a
series of studies by Colorado Division of Wildlife to determine the cause(s) for these dramatic
population declines. What was discovered was not specific to mule deer, but rather was much
more widespread. It was apparent that many of the problems related to mule deer declines were
shared by other species, including plants. Because of the recognition of declining habitat on the
Uncompahgre Plateau, and the ramifications that unchecked decline would have on mule deer
and other species, a collaborative, community based effort was formulated to address the
concerns. As a result, the Public Lands Partnership was created. Upper Colorado Environmental
Plant Center (UCEPC) was contacted by Rick Sherman. A summary of this partnership and the
Uncompahgre Plateau Project is provided below.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Uncompahgre Plateau Project (UP) was formalized in a 2001 MOU by the Public Lands
Partnership (PLP), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Colorado Division of Wildlife
(CDOW), and U.S. Forest Service (USFS). These organizations formed a partnership to work
collaboratively to restore and sustain the ecological, social, cultural, and economic values of the
Uncompahgre Plateau. The UP area, located in southwest Colorado, comprises over 1.5 million
acres of private, state, and federal lands. Approximately 75 percent of the area is public land.
Native plant communities on the Plateau are maturing and becoming less diverse and productive.
As a result, water quality, wildlife habitat, and forage yields have declined while soil erosion and
noxious weed invasion have increased. Changes on the Plateau have resulted due to natural
processes and past management practices including fire suppression and historic overgrazing. A
decline in landscape health is particularly evident in the pinyon-juniper zone. A number of
agency management plans and studies document these concerns. UP is assisting in the
coordination of management across jurisdictional boundaries to address ecosystem needs.
The overarching goal of the project is to improve the ecosystem health and natural functions of
the Uncompahgre Plateau through active restoration projects. Sustaining social, cultural, and
economic values to the local communities are also important goals. The primary role of UP is to
help coordinate and facilitate restoration activities on the Plateau. UP does not supercede
management authority on any federal, state, or private lands.
