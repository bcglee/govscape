METHODS
Collections
No seed collections were conducted by UCEPC in 2005 or 2006. To date, UCEPC has collected
four grass species, three shrubs, and two forbs that can be utilized for seed increase or
containerized production. Table 1 outlines the clean seed quantities collected during the 2002,
2003, and 2004 field seasons. A total of five collection days were used to obtain the seed. The
six materials collected in 2002 were from two trips. The first trip on July 1 was conducted south
and east of Montrose and the second trip, July 19, was done on the Uncompahgre Plateau. In
2003, a collection was conducted June 23 on Sims Mesa and on July 30, the entire staff again
collected on the Plateau. A single trip, August 12, was taken to the Uncompahgre Plateau in
2004. All of these materials remain on inventory at the Plant Center.
