Soil Nutrient Cycling
The submodel for Organic Matter and Nitrogen cycling
(OMNI)islinkedtootherrelatedsubmodelsintheRZWQM
such as soil chemistry, solute transport, and plant growth.
Significant use of concepts and principles found in nutrient
models such as NTRM (Shaffer and Larson, 1987), Phoenix
(Juma and McGill, 1986), CENTURY (Parton et al., 1983),
andFrissel’sNmodel(FrisselandvanVeen,1981)werealso
used (Shaffer etal., 2000). Organic Matter andNitrogen cy-
cling(OMNI)accounts forallNandC processesandpools,
with a subset of these processes modeled independently by
rateequations.Theremainingprocessesaremodeledasfunc-
tions of specified zero-order and first-order rate equations.
