ontheTypeIsumofsquareseachcontributedtothemodel
sumofsquares(SASInstitute,2000).Basedonthisinforma-
tion, we identified the parameter or combination of param-
eters with the highest correlations and highest probabilities
for simulated and observed tile drainage. We determined at
thispoint whetherfurther testingwas neededwithin amore

For the analysis of simulated and observed values of tile
drainage and of nitrate leaching, we regressed the final ob-
servedvaluesonsimulatedvaluesusinglinearregressionanal-
ysis (SAS Institute, 2000), to compare r2 values, slopes, and
intercepts.Wecalculatedtherelativerootmeansquareerror
