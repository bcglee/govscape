AIR FORCE RELEASES RANCH HAND BASELINE MORTALITY STUDY
The U.S. Air Force today released the first mortality report of its Ranch
Hand (Agent Orange) study, an epidemiological investigation of the possible
adverse health effects from herbicide exposure of Air Force members who
conducted aerial spraying missions in Southeast Asia (Operation Ranch Hand).
The purpose of the study is to determine whether long-term adverse health
effects exist and whether they can be attributed to occupational exposure to
herbicides and their contaminants.
The mortality analyses described in the report have not revealed any
statistical excess in the deaths recorded in the herbicide/dioxin-exposed
group. At this time, there is no indication that Operation Ranch Hand
personnel have experienced any increased mortality or any unusual patterns of
death in time or by cause. They are not dying in increased numbers, at
earlier ages or by unexpected causes.
Twelve hundred sixty-nine individuals who were assigned to Air Force
units directly involved in Operation Ranch Hand were identified through
extensive searches of military historical and personnel records. Most of
these men were exposed to herbicides for up to 10-12 hours a day, five to six
days a week, for periods of at least one year. Thus, the Air Force considers
them to be the most heavily herbicide-exposed group of U.S. military personnel
in Southeast Asia.
For the purposes of statistical comparison, a group of other Air Force
personnel assigned to duty in Southeast Asia were matched to the Ranch Hand
group by race, job and date of birth. Five comparison subjects were selected
for each Ranch Hander to improve the ability of the study to detect a
difference in the death experience. The death experience of the
herbicide/dioxin-exposed group was contrasted with the death experience of the
matched group, as well as with three other groups external to the study: the
1978 U.S. white male, population, a Department of Defense(DOD) retired
population, and the 1956 graduating class of West Point.
