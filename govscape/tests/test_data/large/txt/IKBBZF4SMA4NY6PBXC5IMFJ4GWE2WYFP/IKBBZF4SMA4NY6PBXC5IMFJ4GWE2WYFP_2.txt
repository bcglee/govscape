Analyses showed that, to date, the mortality experience of the Ranch
Banders is identical to that of the matched comparison group. The overall
rates and causes of death are not significantly different between the groups.
However, it does appear that officers are living longer than enlisted
personnel in both groups.
The Ranch Handers did show a relative decrease in cancer, but an increase
in liver disorder deaths; however, both these findings are statistically
nonsignificant. There were no soft tissue sarcoma deaths diagnosed in either
group.
Analyses of both the Ranch Hand and comparison groups to the 1978 U.S.
white male mortality experience showed highly significant findings of lower
mortality rates among Air Force members. Most of these differences can be
attributed to the healthy worker effect (due to the fact that individuals must
be in good health upon entry into the military, while the general U.S.
population is not subject to this form of "selection").
The DOD retired and West Point data were used for further analyses in an
attempt to correct for the healthy worker effect. The contrast with the DOD
data again demonstrated significantly less mortality for Ranch Hand officers,
comparison officers and comparison enlisted men; however, there was not a
statistically significant favorable mortality rate for Ranch Hand enlisted
personnel. The West Point comparison had to be restricted to an analysis of
the officer groups since all West Point graduates become officers. This
analysis revealed no differences in mortality.
The fact that adverse effects have not yet been detected does not imply
that an effect may not become manifest in the future. For this reason,
further analyses are intended and mortality in the study population will be
ascertained annually up to the next 20 years.
The data from the Ranch Hand questionnaires and physical examinations
will be published in October 1983 when the morbidity report is completed.
