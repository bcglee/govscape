percent of the operations with nondiarrheic
calf samplestestedhad at least one positive.
Some of the test resultswere related to
calf age. Amongdiarrheic calves, those
positivefor Giardiatended to be older than
those that were negative, 47.1 days for
positiveand 35.3 days for negative
(Figure2).
Figures3 and 4 show the resultsof
testingfor both organismsby age group.
The percentageof diarrheic calves positive
for Giardiawas highest for those in the 31-
to 60-dayagegroup (37.1 percent, Figure
3). More than one-half of the nondiarrheic
calves from 61 to 90 days of age tested
Figure3
positivefor Giardia(Figure4).
Overall, there was a trendto decreasing
prevalence of positive samplesamong
nondiarrheic calves as the average age of the
calves increased.
In summary,Cryptosporidium and
Giardiaappearto be commonin beef calves
whethertheyhave diarrhea or not and are
commonin beef herds. Fecalsheddingof
both organisms is related to calf age with
oldestcalves being much less likely to shed
than youngcalves.
