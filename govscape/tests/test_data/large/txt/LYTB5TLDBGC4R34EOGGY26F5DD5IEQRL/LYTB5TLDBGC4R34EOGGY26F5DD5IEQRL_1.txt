the soil, the same nine parameters as
reported in the wastewater were
measured in the groundwater sam-
pled at about the 9 ft depth. The
removal of COD and plant nutrients
is essentially 100 percent. The residu-
al 30 mg of COD in the groundwater
is about the level present in such sam-
ples in that area, with or without
organic matter addition to the fields.
Loading rates for organic matter
and nutrients are as follows: Organic
matter additions to the field were
about 20,000 lb COD/acre each year.
Approximately 770 lb nitrogen, 140
lb phosphorus and 1,525 lb potassi-
um/acre were applied each year.
Most of the nitrogen can be utilized
by the growing crop. Phosphorus and
potassium are in excess of the needs
of the growing crop, but should not
pose pollution hazards. in this system
excess nitrogen is denitrified because
of the relatively shallow water table.
Groundwater quality is good, and in
most cases meets the minimum stan-
