Industrial Wastes Control charged from the plant to a pri-
mary clarifier system. The pri-
mary clarifier overflow (2,600 to
3,100 gpm) flows to a retention pond
and then to the field for irrigation.
Another source of wastewater (75
to 125 gpm) is the livestock feeding
operation, where a number of live-
stock are fed on a slotted corral.
Manure is worked into the slots and
water carries it into a manure recla-
mation unit where the solids are sepa-
rated from the liquid waste. These
liquid wastes then go into the same
retaining pond as the potato process-
ing effluent.
The clarifier underflow is com-
bined with the peeling waste in a pit
silo and later used for livestock feed.
The wastewater flow pattern is shown
in Fig. 1.
Wastewater Irrigation
The fields used for irrigation were
saline when the potato processing
plant was constructed. This condition
was caused by a high water table in
the area. The large volume of water
pumped from the aquifer for the
plant lowered the water table and

In preparing the land for waste-
