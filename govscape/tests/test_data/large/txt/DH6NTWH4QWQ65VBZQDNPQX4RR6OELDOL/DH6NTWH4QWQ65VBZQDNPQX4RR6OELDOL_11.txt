3. The U.S. Should Follow Europe in Banning Potentially Infectious
Cattle Parts from the Human Food Supply
Scientists believe that BSE can be transmitted to humans through beef
contaminated with BSE-infected tissue and cause vCJD. In perhaps the most definitive
example, an investigation of a cluster of vCJD cases in Leicestershire, England,
"demonstrated an association with beef consumption, purchased from butchers where
there was a risk of cross-contamination of beef carcass meat with bovine brain, and the
development of vCJD."~~
A 1997 WHO document listed the brain and spinal cord as the most infectious
tissues in scrapie-infected sheep and BSE-infected cattle. Subsequently, the European
Commission's Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) published a Listing of Specified Risk
Materials (SRM) that stated that the infectivity of the spinal cord is not in The
SSC also listed the bovine brain, eyes, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, dura matter,
pituitary, skull and vertebral column, and lungs as being high-risk material for the
transmission of BSE.
The SSC report discusses three issues relating to whether vertebral columns can
be used in the human and animal food chains: the potential contamination of the vertebral
columns by spinal cord during the course of its removal; the presence of coexisting
