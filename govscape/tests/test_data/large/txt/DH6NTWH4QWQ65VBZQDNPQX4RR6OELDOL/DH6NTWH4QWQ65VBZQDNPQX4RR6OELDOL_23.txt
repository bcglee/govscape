2. Meat Containing Spinal Cord is "Adulterated" Because it is Unsound,
Unhealthful, Unwholesome or Otherwise Unfit for Human Food
The definition of "adulteration" found in FMIA section (60 1)(m)(3) provides that
meat is adulterated if the Secretary finds that the meat is "for any other reason unsound,
unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food." This gives the Secretary
broad discretion to determine the safety and quality of meat as conditions change,
including conditions involving animal health. Indeed, the Secretary has used this
discretion in the past to address similar situations. In 1988, for example, FSIS issued a
new regulation for the disposition of the thyroid glands under the authority of section
601(m)(3) and based on "an outbre& ...associated with consumption of beef products
made from trimmings containing cattle thyroid glands."67
In light of recent science, bovine spinal cord and other potentially infectious
material must be considered unwholesome and unfit for human consumption. Until the
1980's, BSE was unknown. Until 1996, it was not known that BSE could be transmitted
through the food chain to humans. Therefore, regulations were adopted that allowed
MSM products to contain spinal cord materiaL6* Today, we know better. The science
and experience of the last 10 years have demonstrated that BSE is not just an animal-
health concern, but a significant human-health concern as well. Meat that contains spinal
cord is, in fact, unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, and unfit for human food. We urge
the Secretary not to wait for an outbreak of BSE before instituting precautions to protect
