should publish the regulations as an interim final rule and provide an explanation for its

rulemaking as contemplated under 2204e(b)(l) of the USDA Reorganization Act.
IV. Conclusion
While BSE has never been found in U.S. cattle herds, the recent discovery that
BSE is much more widespread in Europe than previously thought makes clear that
precautionary measures are needed to prevent meat products contaminated with infective
tissue from ever posing a serious health threat. Unfortunately, the existing regulatory
system does not minimize that threat.
USDA should act immediately to eliminate meat containing spinal cord and other
potentially infective material from the school lunch program and other federal feeding
programs. Second, USDA should develop and enforce regulations that ban potentially
infective tissues from the human food supply, including meat produced by the MSM and
AMR systems. CSPI and the co-signers to this petition urge the agency to take that step
without further delay, before the first "mad cow" is discovered in the U.S. Protecting the
human food supply after BSE is discovered would be like locking the barn door after the
cows have already left.
