Dear Secretary Veneman:
Enclosed is our petition for regulatory action to bar the use of spinal cord and columns and other
potentially infectious tissue fiom beef in the human food supply. We appreciate your prompt
response to our letter last week on beef intended for the school lunch program and I look forward
to working with you and your staff to resolve the concerns that we have outlined in this petition.
Very truly yours,
