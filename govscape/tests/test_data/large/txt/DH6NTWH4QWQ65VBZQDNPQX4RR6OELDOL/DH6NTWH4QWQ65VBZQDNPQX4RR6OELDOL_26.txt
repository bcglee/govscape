3. The Requested Regulations Present a Situation In Which
Regulatory Analysis is "Not Practicable Because of Compelling
Circumstances" Under the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Reorganization Act of 1994
Under fj 2204e of the USDA Reorganization Act of 1994, USDA must complete a
risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis for each proposed major regulation that relates
to human health, safety, or the en~ironment.T~h at section does provide an exception,
however: when a risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis is "not practicable because of
compelling circumstances," an explanation can be provided in lieu of a full analysis.73
USDA's Ofice of Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis, which has been in
operation for six years, has yet to exempt a proposed rule from the regulatory-analysis
requirement. Nevertheless, CSPI and other co-signers to this petition believe that the
rulemaking requested in this petition readily satisfies the exemption. The public-health
threat that would be posed by BSE-infected meat products presents the "compelling
circumstances" needed to justify the promulgation of regulations without undertaking a
full risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis. In addition, two elements of the risk
analysis are impossible to determine: First, the percent, if any, of infected livestock, and
second, the cost to the production system if BSE is found.
CSPI and the other co-signers contend that the potential for BSE to be found in
U.S. cattle constitutes the "compelling circumstances" necessary to permit FSIS to adopt
the requested regulation without first completing a full regulatory analysis. FSIS instead
