That important protection, if properly enforced, could help to prevent any undiscovered
cases of BSE from spreading through the U.S. cattle population.
However, sufficient protections are not given to human consumers of beef
products. A fire wall is needed to prevent any potentially BSE-infected tissue from
entering the human food supply. The USDA has already recognized the need for such
safeguards and issued a directive banning spinal cord tissue from the meat produced in
AMR systems. Unfortunately, due to weak enforcement mechanisms and the near-
impossibility of removing the dorsal root ganglia from spinal columns, that directive has
proven inadequate to prevent spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and other potentially
infective central nervous system tissue from entering the human food supply. Therefore,
we request that USDA regulations be amended to require that spinal columns and neck
bones of cattle do not enter AMR systems. In addition, USDA regulations and
purchasing requirements should ensure that spinal cord and other potentially infective
tissue is not allowed in processed beef product^.^
11. Scientific Justification
Both CJD and BSE belong to a family of neurologic diseases that are called
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) because they can be passed from one
organism to another and cause the brain to become riddled with holes. TSEs are caused
by "proteinaceous infectious particles" or "pri~ns."~P rions have the remarkable ability to
2The intent of the regulatory review should be to identlfy places where potentially infective spinal cord or CNS
material is entering the food supply in a hidden form, as in ground meat or other processed products. We are not
seeking, at this time, a ban on the sale of intact meat products where adhering spinal cord or other CNS material is
visible and avoidable, as with T-bone steaks.
