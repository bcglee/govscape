revised and expanded a number of times as new information became available.34 In
1995, the U.K. also banned the use of "the vertebral column of a bovine animal in the
recovery of meat by mechanical mean^."^'
The countries of Europe have recently instituted widespread precautions to protect
consumers. In February of this year, as a result of the SSC opinion, the European
Commission required the removal of the vertebral column from all carcasses fi-om cattle
over 12 months and also outlawed the production of all mechanically-recovered meat that
comes from cattle or sheep.36
To minimize the risk of BSE entering the human food supply, USDA should
adopt precautions similar to those adopted in Europe to keep spinal columns and neck
bones out of AMR and other systems that mechanically separate the meat fi-om the
bone.37 These precautions are essential to protect both public health and consumer
confidence in the event that BSE is present but undetected in U.S. cattle. In addition, the
USDA should ban the use in human food of all bovine specified risk materials, as
identified and updated by the World Health Organization. Such restrictions would
