Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, said that "the possibility of
a case of BSE in the U.S. could not be completely excluded.""
In July 2000, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European
Commission published a Geographical BSE Risk Assessment together with detailed
assessment reports for 23 countries, including the U.S.12 The risk assessment classified
countries into four levels, with countries at level one being unlikely to have BSE-infected
cattle to countries at level four having confirmed cases of BSE. The U.S. was ranked as
level two, meaning that the presence of BSE in this country is unlikely but not excluded.13
Therefore, it is appropriate to take precautionary measures to protect the human food
supply.
Recent developments demonstrate why such measures are appropriate. BSE was
recently discovered in several European countries that previously had no documented
BSE cases. Before October 2000, certain high-risk organs and tissues (called "specified
risk materials" or "SRM) were used in the human food chain in the European Union,14 a
fact that contributed to the loss in consumer confidence in the countries where BSE has
