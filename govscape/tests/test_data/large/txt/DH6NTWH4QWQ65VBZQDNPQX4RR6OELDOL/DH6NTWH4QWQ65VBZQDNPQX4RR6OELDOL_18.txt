product.52 Those 45 million pounds of AMR product may be mixed with hundreds of
millions of pounds of other meat.
FSIS's enforcement of its Directive banning spinal cords in AMR equipment has
been inadequate. In 1997, following a request by the Center for Science in the Public
Intere~tt,h~e~ USDA directed its employees to periodically check the spinal columns
going into the AMR systems to ensure that plant employees are "completely removing
spinal cord from neck andfor back bones before the bones enter the [AMR] system."54 In
addition, inspectors were instructed to send suspect product to a USDA lab for testing if
they thought plant employees were not adequately removing the spinal cord. However,
FSIS employees can take no other action to prevent this meat from being sold to the
public.
Evidence to date suggests that sampling of AMR meat under the Directive is
rarely performed, in part because the USDA has determined that the presence of spinal
cord in meat is not a food-safety violation. While food-safety inspection tasks are
assigned more frequently, the AMR checks are considered quality-control checks, which
are principally the responsibility of the industry. While CSPI has no evidence of how
frequently these checks are actually performed, plant enforcement information on the
number of samples analyzed since 1997 indicates that government inspection of the bones
going into AMR machines may be quite rare.
