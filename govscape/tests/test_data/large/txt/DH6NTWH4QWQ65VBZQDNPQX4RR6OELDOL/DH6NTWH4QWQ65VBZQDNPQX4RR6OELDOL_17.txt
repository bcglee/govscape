products marketed as meat do not include spinal cord are not intended as a response to
concerns that some have expressed about spongifom encephalopathies. Available data
indicate that the United States is bovine spongifom encephalopathy (BSE) free."49
However, in light of the recent discovery of BSE in several countries that were
previously thought to be BSE-free, and other evidence that suggests there is a risk of BSE
existing in or entering the United States, it is imperative that FSIS ensure that Americans
are not consuming the parts of cattle that are most likely to be infectious. As spinal cords
and dorsal root ganglia from infected cattle are highly infectious, AMR systems provide
the single best opportunity for BSE-infected material to enter the food supply today. And
this meat may be used in several staples of the American diet, like hot dogs, hamburgers
and sausages.
Meat produced by AMR systems enters a variety of products. According to a
report prepared on behalf of the meat industry, "a high proportion of the product (beef) is
blended with other meat while a smaller portion is sold as stand alone product for uses
such as jerky, taco meat or pizza toppings."50 In 1998, approximately 70% of the total
fed cattle and hogs and 60% of the dairy cows slaughtered in 1998 were processed
through the AMR system5' and AMR systems produced 45.3 million pounds of beef
