scientist from Colorado State University, to test meat at eight major AMR plants.
Although Schmidt did not give CSPI his test results, he told us that he is finding spinal
cord in some of his samples.58
This evidence demonstrates that FSIS's directive is not sufficient to protect
consumers if BSE is present in or spreads to U.S. cattle. The best way to ensure that
AMR meat is free of CNS tissue is to prohibit the use of the spinal columns and neck
bones in the AMR systems.
111. Legal Authority
In enacting the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA),59C ongress gave USDA
broad power to prevent the introduction of adulterated meat and poultry into commerce.
The FMIA is premised on a congressional finding, among other things, that "[ilt is
essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by
assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not
adulterated, and properly marked, labeled and pa~kaged."~T' he courts have agreed that
the purpose of this statute is to ensure high levels of cleanliness and safety of meat
products. See, e.g., Original Honey Baked Ham v. Glickman, 172 F.3d 885, 887 @.C.
Cir. 1991) (stating that the FMIA has a purpose of ensuring that "meat .. . products are
'wholesome [and] not adulterated,' all to the end of protecting the 'health and welfare of
consumers' and the market for wholesome and unadulterated products").
