significantly reduce the amount of potentially infectious spinal cord and dorsal root
ganglia that enter the human food supply.
4. FSIS Regulations Permit Mechanically Separated Beef To Contain
Spinal Cord
Currently, a product labeled as "mechanically separated beef7m ay contain spinal
cord as long as the product is not labeled as "meat."38 As spinal cord is a high-risk tissue
for the transmission of BSE, this regulation should be repealed or amended to explicitly
ban spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia from the human food supply.
Mechanically separated beef may legally constitute up to 20 percent of the meat
portion of a food product.39 Meat industry officials, however, have told CSPI that they
are not aware of any beef processors currently producing mechanically separated beef.
Regardless of whether anyone is currently producing mechanically separated beef, it is
inappropriate to have an existing regulation that allows spinal cord tissue of cattle to
legally enter the human food chain. USDA regulations must be changed in recognition of
the fact that the spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia of cattle could potentially contain the
infectious BSE agent and should be excluded from the food supply. For mechanically
separated beef, the best way to do this is by banning bovine spinal columns and neck
bones from entering those systems.
Mechanically separated beef is defined as "any finely comminuted product
