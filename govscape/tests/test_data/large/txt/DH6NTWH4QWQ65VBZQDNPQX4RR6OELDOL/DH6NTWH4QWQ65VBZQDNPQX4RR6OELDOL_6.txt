People diagnosed with vCJD may show a variety of symptoms. They may suffer
from leg pain and difficulty walking, hallucinations, and they may lose the ability to see,
speak, or feed themselves. Other symptoms include crying, screaming, memory loss, and
a general degradation of mental functioning. This new form of CJD is a devastating
disease that is invariably fatal.
Consumption of beef contaminated with BSE-infected tissue has been linked to
the development of vCJD in humans.' In 1996, vCJD killed ten people in Europe
(principally in the U.K.); last year it killed 27.9 In all, about 100 people have died from
the disease in Europe." No one knows how many more are already infected and will
develop and die from vCJD, which appears to take at least five to ten years to emerge.

the U.S.
a. USDA Can't Guarantee That U.S. Cattle Are BSE-free
Although no case of BSE has ever been identified in U.S. cattle, it is possible that
the disease could have escaped detection and be present currently somewhere in the
country or that it could in the future spread to the U.S. At a Senate hearing on April 4,
