enough safeguards to prevent high-risk materials, like brain and spinal cords, from
entering the human food supply shows that it is imperative to exclude those high risk
organs and tissues from the human food supply well before the first case of BSE is
discovered in this country to protect public health and consumer confidence.
Consumer confidence in this country has already been affected by BSE. A Porter
Novelli poll of 815 people living in the U.S. found that "14% said they had changed their
food purchasing or family dining habits based on news about mad cow disease and foot-
and-mouth disease."16 Consumer confidence in the safety of the U.S. meat supply could
plummet if it is disclosed that USDA-inspected beef and meat products may contain

Although the USDA has conducted BSE tests on approximately 14,000 cattle
suspected of having a central nervous system di~order,o'~ut of hundreds of millions of
