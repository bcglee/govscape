induce other proteins to become deformed. Prions are unusual disease-causing agents
because they are extremely dificult to destroy. Many cases of human TSEs, including
90% of CJD cases, are sporadic, which means that the disease can show up in an
individual with no apparent cause.4 TSEs are characterized by a long incubation period,
relatively short duration of clinical signs, and a 100% mortality rate.5
TSEs have been documented in a wide variety of species, including sheep
(scrapie), cattle (BSE), deer (chronic wasting disease or CWD), mink (transmissible mink
encephalopathy or TME), cats (feline spongiform encephalopathy or FSE), and others.
Scrapie, CWD, and TME have been reported in the U.S. The following prion diseases
have been recognized in humans: Kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler-ScheinkerSyndrome, Fatal
Familial Insomnia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD).~
1. The Human Disease, vCJD, is Devastating and Justifies Strong
Precautionary Public Health Measures
CJD is a sporadic disease that has been said to strike about one person in a million
ann~ally.I~n the 1990s, a new variant of CJD emerged in the United Kingdom. Unlike
the sporadic form of the disease, which seldom strikes those under age 50, vCJD occurs
primarily in young men and women.
