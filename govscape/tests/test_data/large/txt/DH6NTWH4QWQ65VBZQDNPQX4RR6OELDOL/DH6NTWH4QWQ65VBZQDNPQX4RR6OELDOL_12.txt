nervous system material (such as dorsal root ganglia) with the same infectivity as the
spinal cord; and any potential infectivity from bone marrow.29
The report states that contamination of the vertebral column by spinal cord "can
be expected under most practical slaughterhouse circumstances. ..the SSC advises the
removal of the vertebral columns from all older animals even when the presumed
infective spinal cord has been removed."30
The SSC report says, "new (unpublished) evidence shows that the dorsal root
ganglia -sited within the general structure of the vertebral column -should be
considered as having an infectivity for BSE equivalent to that of the spinal cord ....The
dorsal root ganglia cannot be removed without extreme difficulty. This therefore means
that a precautionary proposal relating to the removal of the whole vertebral column (other
than the coccyx) is now appr~priate."S~u~b sequently, this finding that dorsal root
ganglia are highly infectious has been published.32
Starting in the 1990s, public health officials all over Europe began to recognize
the need to prevent potentially infectious brain and spinal cord materials from entering
-
the human food supply. Great Britain banned some "specified bovine offal" from the
human food chain beginning in 1989.33 The list of banned bovine organs and tissues was
