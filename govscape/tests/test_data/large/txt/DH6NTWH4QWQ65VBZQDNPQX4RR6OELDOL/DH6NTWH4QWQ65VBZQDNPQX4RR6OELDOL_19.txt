FSIS data from the first six months after the directive took effect indicates that
inspectors submitted laboratory samples of AMR product less than three dozen times. Of
34 product samples taken from April-September 1997, only about 14 were samples of
beef, and the rest were samples of pork. Of the beef samples, three (21%) were found to
contain CNS tissue.55 Inspection reports from 1997 also indicate that even when
inspectors witness spinal cord entering the AMR system, it is not always detected in
laboratory testing. On three occasions, an inspector witnessed beef with attached spinal
cord entering the AMR system, but spinal cord couldn't be "definitively identified" in the
Between 1998 and August 200 1,99 samples were analyzed under this directive.
This is a pitifilly small number, considering that 45 million pounds of beef paste was
produced by AMR systems in just 19 98.57 Out of these 99 samples, nine were positive
for CNS tissue, and peripheral nerve tissue was found in other samples as well.
Independent testing also indicates that USDA's directive has not been filly
effective. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association hired Glenn Schmidt, a meat
