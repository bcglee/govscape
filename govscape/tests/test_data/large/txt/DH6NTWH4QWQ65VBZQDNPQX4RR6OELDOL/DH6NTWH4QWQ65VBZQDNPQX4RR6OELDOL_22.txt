to adequately assess the health effects of mechanically deboned meat. The case presents
issues that are highly analogous to the issues presented in this petition. First,
mechanically separated meat (MSM) is comparable to the meat produced from AMR
systems. In fact, AMR systems are just the next generation of the equipment. Second,
bone fragments, like spinal cord, are a constituent of cattle, but not of meat. Third, bone
fragments can --but do not always --pose a risk to human health. In the era of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, that is also the case with spinal cord.
In the court's own words:
As to the more health-related aspect of adulteration (J 601( m) (I)), however, it is
lihly that the Secretary's approval of the use of MDM (mechanically deboned
meat) in this regulation will be found clearly erroneous. . . . In order for the
Secretary to approve the use of MDM as he has done in this regulation, therefore,
he is required by law to have made a determination that there is no substantial
possibility that the presence of bone particles in a concentration of .45% in
processedproducts containing MDM could harm the health of those ingesting the
products. It is not at all clear that the Secretary has made such determinations
with the required thoro~ghness.~~
The same is true of USDA's regulations on spinal cord in the AMRMSM
systems: The agency has looked at only the quality aspects of meat or meat product
produced by those systems and has failed to consider whether spinal cord in the meat
could harm those ingesting it. It is clear that USDA has not made these determinations
with the "required thoroughness" the law demands.66
