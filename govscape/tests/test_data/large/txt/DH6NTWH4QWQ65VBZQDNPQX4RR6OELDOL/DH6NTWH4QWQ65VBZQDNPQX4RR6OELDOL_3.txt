need to institute all reasonable public health precautions to prevent vCJD in the event that
US. cattle are infected with BSE.
I. Action Requested
We request that FSIS issue a regulation banning beef slaughter and processing
operations from using spinal columns and neck bones in AMR or other systems that
mechanically separate meat from bones. In addition, USDA should fully evaluate its
regulations and buying specifications to determine what other food products might
contain brain tissue, spinal cord, or other potentially infectious materials from cattle.'
Meat products containing these ingredients should be banned or produced differently to
assure their safety. Those actions would help prevent contamination of the food supply
with the infective agent that causes BSE, if U.S. cattle have BSE.
BSE is a neurologic disease in cattle that has become a major public health
concern because it may cause a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), called variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), in humans. Both of those diseases are degenerative
neurological diseases that cause devastating symptoms and are always fatal. Many
governments, including the U.S. government, have implemented safeguards to prevent
BSE from infecting their cattle herds. Although BSE has never been documented in U.S.
cattle, the Food and Drug ~dkinistration(F DA) has prohibited the feeding of most types
of mammalian protein to ruminants to prevent the spread of BSE among the cattle
population as a precaution in case one or more cases of BSE are already in this country.
'As an example, CSPI recently wrote the Secretary concerning our discovery that USDA specifications for
many types of beef purchased for the Federal School Lunch Program and other Federal Food Assistance Programs
explicitly permit small bits of spinal cord in beef intended for those programs. By letter on August 8,2001, Secretary
Veneman told CSPI that "[tlhis particular purchase specification appears unnecessary and has no practical effect given
the FSIS requirements already in place, therefore, the reference is being eliminated."
