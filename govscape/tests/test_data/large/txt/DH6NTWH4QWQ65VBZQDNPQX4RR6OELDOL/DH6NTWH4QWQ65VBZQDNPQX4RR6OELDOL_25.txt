Because FSIS's directive on AMR was based on quality considerations, rather
than safety, its enforcement has been minimal. As discussed above in section II.S.a., both
government testing and private testing have shown that the Directive has not been not
fully effective in keeping spinal cord and other infective material out of the human food
supply. USDA must utilize a stronger public-health approach to ensure that AMR meat
does not provide a disease pathway for BSE.
The scientific evidence is much clearer now than when USDA's current standards
were adopted that spinal cord tissue, dorsal root ganglia, and other CNS tissue in the beef
supply raises food-safety concerns, as this tissue from infected cattle could spread a
transmissible spongifonn encephalopathy to humans. Therefore, it is time for FSIS to
implement meaningful and enforceable food-safety regulations to prevent BSE from
entering the U.S. food supply. Even though BSE has not been found in U.S. herds,
precautions are needed to protect the public's health and consumer confidence in the
event that the disease already exists undetected in our herds or in the future enters the
U.S. through imported cattle.
In addition to the foregoing provisions of the FMIA, the statute also contains a
general provision that supports the actions requested in this petition, granting the
Secretary broad authority to promulgate rules and regulations "necessary to carry out the
A~t[s]."~F"SIS relied upon those provisions when it promulgated its HACCPIPathogen
Reduction Rule,71a nd they are equally applicable here.
