different types of feed, as required by the feed ban.22A nd 85 feed plants out of over 400
surveyed did not label their feed with information about which animals it was and, more
importantly, was not intended for, as required by the 1997 feed ban.23
This gap in protection made headlines in January 2001, when a Texas feedlot
inadvertently fed meat-and-bone meal intended for pigs and poultry to more than 1,200
cattle.24A clerk at Purina Mills in St. Louis had mistakenly mixed the pig-and-poultry
supplement into the company's cattle feed. Although the meal was produced in the U.S.
from presumably BSE-free cattle, Purina Mills purchased the animals to keep their meat
out of the food supply.25 Clearly, that episode demonstrates that the feed ban is not
trustworthy enough to safeguard the public. According to Stephen Sundlof, head of FDA
Center for Veterinary Medicine, other breaches like this have occurred.26 Because the
FDA's feed rules aren't strict enough, if one cow in the U.S. has BSE, there is an
increased likelihood that it could spread to other cattle. Therefore, it is risky for
Americans to be consuming the central nervous system tissue of cattle.

meal in all types of animal feed.
