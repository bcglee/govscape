mechanically separated beef should be changed to exclude spinal cord, dorsal root
ganglia, and other central nervous system tissue.
5. The Products of Advanced Meat Recovery Systems Could Contain
Potentially Infectious Tissue
If undetected BSE exists in the U.S., or occurs here in the future, advanced meat
recovery systems could also produce meat capable of transmitting the disease to humans.
AMR machines take bones with attached muscles and nerves and put them through a
device that removes the soft tissue from the bone. According to FSIS regulations, those
machines are supposed to detach the meat without crushing, pulverizing or grinding the
bone itself.41 Bones must emerge from those machines essentially intact and in natural
conformation so that they are recognizable, i.e., comparable to those resulting from hand-
deb~ning.A~M~R systems produce a product that can be called "meat" under current
government requirement^.^^
AMR systems strip any soft tissue from the bones that enter the equipment. If bits
of spinal cord remain attached to the spinal column or neck bone that enters these
machines, that soft tissue may be incorporated into the meat that is produced.44 USDA
inspector reports provide clear evidence that spinal cords attached to spinal columns are
