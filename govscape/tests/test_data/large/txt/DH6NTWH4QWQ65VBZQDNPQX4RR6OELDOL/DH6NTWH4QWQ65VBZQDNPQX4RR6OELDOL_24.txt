the human food supply. It is time for the Department to amend its regulations and buying
specifications to address the human-health implications of BSE.
Recent scientific disclosures about BSE support the notion that the presence of
bovine brain, spinal cord and other potentially infective materials in the human food
supply would make the meat unwholesome and adulterated. Therefore, USDA is
compelled under the FMIA to prevent these agents from entering the human food supply.
Under comparable facts, the FDA has found that bovine material should be
banned from animal feed. The FDA determined that this material is no longer generally
recognized as safe, and therefore must be regulated under their food additive approval
provisions. FDA said in that rulemaking, that: "the act as a whole and the 1958 Food
Additive Amendment in particular were intended to give FDA the tools to prevent harm
to the public health before it occurred."69 While USDA has never adequately addressed
the question of whether bovine SRM materials are adulterants, the agency has exercised
its authority to exclude it from certain meat food products. In 1997, FSIS recognized that
spinal cord in the meat product of AMR systems raised a quality issue and required the
industry to remove the spinal cord from the bony spinal columns before they entered
AMR systems. In fact, FSIS based the Directive 7160.2 on its finding that product
containing spinal cord does "not come within the definition of "meat" in 30 1.2(rr)(2) of
the regulations." This finding constitutes a labeling determination, as FSIS has attempted
to avoid the safety questions surrounding spinal cord in the human food supply. Now
these safety questions are placed squarely before the Secretary.
