What Plant Growth Regulators Affect Leafy Spurge Bud Growth?
Leafy spurge is a deep rooted perennial weed that paclobutrazol (a gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor)
propagates vegetatively from an abundance of under- cause repression of root bud growth. In contrast,
ground adventitious buds located on the roots and gibberellic acid promotes root bud growth; in addition,
