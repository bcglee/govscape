to not spray if you want to keep clean land, clean.
• No patch of leafy spurge is too small to spray.
• It is never too late to start a leafy spurge control
program.
• It is only too late to start to control leafy spurge if you
don’t start now.
• Leafy spurge is here to stay — learn to manage it so
you can live with it.
