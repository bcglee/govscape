Fig. 1. Mean germination percentages of two switchgrass ecotypes after 14 d in the germinator
as affected by storage environment and duration with germination testing beginning in
December 1996 and ending in October 1997. Storage environments used were C, seed cooler
with controlled atmosphere of 7 °C, dehumidified to 55-60% RH; R, laboratory with
temperatures approximately 21 °C and ambient humidity levels; W, unheated warehouse with
temperatures ranging from approximately -1 to 38 °C and ambient humidity levels. Ecotype 746
is NRCS accession 9062746 collected in Grenada County, MS.

Fig. 2. Mean germination percentages of two switchgrass ecotypes after 14 d in the germinator
as affected by storage environment and pre-germination seed treatment with germination
testing beginning in December 1996 and ending in October 1997. Storage environments used
were C, seed cooler with controlled atmosphere of 7 °C, dehumidified to 55-60% RH; R,
laboratory with temperatures approximately 21 °C and ambient humidity levels; W, unheated
warehouse with temperatures ranging from approximately -1 to 38 °C and ambient humidity
levels. Ecotype 746 is NRCS accession 9062746 collected in Grenada County, MS. Pre-
germination seed treatments used were prechilling (PC) seeds at 7 °C for 14 d prior to placement
in the germinator and no prechilling (NC).
