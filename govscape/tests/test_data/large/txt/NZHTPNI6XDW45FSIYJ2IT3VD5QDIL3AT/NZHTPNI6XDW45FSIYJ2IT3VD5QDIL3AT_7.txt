potential pitfall to utilizing this storage method. Once dormancy is broken, viability of some
seed lots has been shown to decline with further storage at high temperatures (Zarnstorff et al.,
1994). Although in this study, neither 746 nor Alamo appeared to exhibit marked germination
declines at the longest storage duration in the R environment, because only two years of seed
production were used, it would be premature to assume that all seed lots of these two ecotypes
would respond in a similar manner. Zarnstorff et al. (1994) recommended a 90-d storage period
at 23 °C and, according to this study, this would appear to be an acceptable period for seeds
stored at room temperature (approximately 21 °C). Seeds could then either be planted or placed
in cool, dry conditions for longer-term storage.
Seeds could also be prechilled before planting. It has been demonstrated that
switchgrass seeds can be prechilled, then dried and stored prior to planting without negating the
effect of the prechilling treatment (Ellmore et al., 1986). The ability to dry seeds after treatment
would simplify handling for both the seed producer as well as the eventual grower; however,
prechilling may not improve field establishment to the same degree as it improves germination
under laboratory conditions (Shaidaee et al., 1969; Zarnstorff et al., 1994). An alternative
solution for planting seed lots exhibiting a higher degree of dormancy would be to provide for a
natural prechilling treatment by planting early in the spring, when soil temperatures are low
and moisture levels are high (Panciera et al., 1987; Sanderson et al., 1996). Planting at this time
might also allow the seedlings to become established before weed pressure intensifies later in the
season (Panciera et al., 1987). However, early planting may be difficult for a majority of growers
in the southeastern USA, because field activities are often hampered by extremely wet soils.
CONCLUSIONS
It may not be possible to develop a single blanket recommendation on seed handling and
storage conditions that would ensure optimum performance of all switchgrass ecotypes and seed
lots. One approach might be to develop different recommendations based upon whether an
individual seed lot exhibits a high degree of innate dormancy. Further testing using additional
seed lots may be required to confirm that the results of this study apply to other ecotypes and
production locations, but it appears that relative dormancy levels can be determined simply by
conducting a germination test using fresh seeds. More fully dormant lots can be handled using
the most acceptable of the treatment methods listed above (i.e. high temperature storage or
prechilling). Seed lots with low innate dormancy will not benefit and viability could potentially
be harmed by such treatments and these are therefore best stored cool and dry. Although
separately treating seed lots with various dormancy levels in this manner may go far in ensuring
better germination, it may not completely remedy the switchgrass establishment problem.
Assuming that dormancy in a particular seed has been overcome prior to planting,
environmental conditions after planting, weed pressure, and a myriad of other factors are major
determinants of whether that seedling can successfully become established.
