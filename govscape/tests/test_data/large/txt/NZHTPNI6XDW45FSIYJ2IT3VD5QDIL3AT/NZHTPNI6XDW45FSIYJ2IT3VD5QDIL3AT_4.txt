for seeds stored in C. Dormancy of several native grass species has been shown to be retained
longer in low temperature, low humidity storage (Coukos, 1944), such as in the C and the first 4
or 5 mo in the W environment and it has been widely reported that dormancy in switchgrass
seeds is overcome more quickly at higher storage temperatures (Aho et al., 1989; Jensen and
Boe, 1991; Zarnstorff et al., 1994). The lack of response to storage temperatures exhibited by
Alamo is a function of the reduced dormancy of this ecotype, which is similar to the response
Zarnstorff et al. (1994) found for ‘Blackwell’ seed lots with low levels of innate dormancy. The
increased germination of the NC 746 seeds after 5 mo in the R environment indicated that this
combination of storage time and conditions was sufficient to overcome much of the innate
dormancy of this seed lot (Table 2).
Accession 746 responded positively to PC, whereas improvement in Alamo germination
was none to slight from this treatment (Table 2). Other researchers have shown that
switchgrass seeds with high levels of innate dormancy respond favorably to PC (Panciera et al.,
1987; Zarnstorff et al., 1994). The response of 746 to PC decreased with increasing storage
duration in the R and W storage environments. This pattern has been exhibited by seeds of
other switchgrass cultivars (Aho et al., 1989; Haynes et al., 1997; Jensen and Boe, 1991;
Zarnstorff et al., 1994), and indiangrass [Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash] (Emal and Conard,
1973). According to Zhang and Maun (1989), germination inhibitors in the embryo decay during
storage, releasing seeds from dormancy; however, the rate of decay is temperature dependent.
In this study, the increased temperatures in the R and during the summer in the W storage
environments would result in an increased rate of decay. Seeds of 746 stored for 11 mo in all
environments responded significantly to PC, indicating that dormancy was still present,
however, the level was higher for seeds stored in the C environment.
In 1997, there were significant ecotype X storage environment X storage duration (Fig.
1), ecotype X storage environment X pre-germination seed treatment (Fig. 2), and ecotype X
storage duration X pre-germination seed treatment interactions (Fig. 3). The underlying causes
of these interactions are similar to those discussed for the four-way interaction in 1996. Alamo
again exhibited higher germination percentages than 746; however, seed quality was better in
this year. There was <1% obviously ergot-infected seeds for both ecotypes, fewer immature
seeds, and germination of both ecotypes at most testing dates was higher than in 1996.
Germination of 746 was higher after storage in R and W (later storage periods), but the
magnitude decreased with increasing storage duration (Fig. 1). The fairly high germination
percentage of 3-mo 746 seeds in the R environment appears to indicate that this storage period,
which was excluded from the 1996 analysis, was sufficient to overcome a significant amount of
seed dormancy. Alamo exhibited little response to storage environment or duration due to its
reduced innate dormancy levels. The PC treatment increased germination of 746 seeds, but the
effect was not as pronounced in the R environment (Fig. 2) or at later storage durations (Fig. 3).
The PC treatment did not appear to be beneficial for Alamo seeds, again due to their lack of
dormancy.
