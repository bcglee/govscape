† No data presented because final test was placed in the germinator on 30 Sept. 1997.
Germination percentages of 746 were lower than Alamo for most storage periods in 1996
(Table 2), indicating that it has a higher level of innate dormancy. The high germination
percentage of Alamo at the shortest storage duration is noteworthy. Germination of freshly
harvested seeds was only 24%; however, when averaged over all storage conditions, germination
of 1-mo NC Alamo seeds was 59%, more than a two-fold increase. Germination of similarly aged
NC 746 seeds averaged only 6.

† 3 mo storage duration not reported because of germinator failure.
‡ Cooler, seed cooler with controlled atmosphere of 7 °C, dehumidified to 55-60% RH; Room, laboratory with
temperatures approximately 21 °C and ambient humidity levels; Warehouse, unheated warehouse with
temperatures ranging from approximately -1 to 38 °C and ambient humidity levels.
§ PC, moist prechill at 7 °C for 14 d prior to placement in the germinator; NC, no prechilling prior to
placement in the germinator.

There was a significant ecotype X storage environment X storage duration X pre-
germination seed treatment interaction in 1996 (Table 2). Germination of both ecotypes was
higher for seeds stored in the R environment and for later storage periods in W (summer) than
