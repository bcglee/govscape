Conservation Service (NRCS) James E. “Bud” Smith Plant Materials Center (PMC) at Knox
City, Texas in 1978, has been tested at numerous sites in the south central and southeastern
USA.
These evaluations have shown Alamo to be the most widely adapted commercial cultivar
throughout this region (Sanderson et al., 1996). Under favorable conditions, Alamo grows too
tallfor some potential uses, which has led personnel at the USDA-NRCS Jamie L. Whitten PMC
at Coffeeville, Mississippi to examine numerous switchgrass accessions collected from
Mississippi and Arkansas to search for shorter growing, upland ecotypes more suitable for forage
production. Preliminary observations indicate that seeds of many of these ecotypes do not
germinate as readily as Alamo.
Freshly harvested seeds of switchgrass have varying levels of dormancy that can
adversely affect establishment (Jensen and Boe, 1991; Panciera et al., 1987; Sanderson et al.,
1996; Zarnstorff et al., 1994). This dormancy has been attributed to physical restriction by the
lemma and palea, because seeds can be induced to germinate by scarification that removes or
weakens these structures (Haynes et al., 1997; Jensen and Boe, 1991; Sautter, 1962; Shaidaee et
al., 1969); however, there is also evidence that germination inhibitors in the embryo are involved
in the maintenance of dormancy (Zhang and Maun, 1989). High storage temperatures,
prolonged storage, and moist prechilling have all been shown to reduce dormancy and improve
germination of switchgrass seeds (Aho et al., 1989; Zarnstorff et al., 1994; Zhang and Maun,
1989).
Because of the growing interest in using switchgrass for forage, erosion control, and
other conservation uses, there is a need for increased understanding of the seed germination
characteristics of this grass. Objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the relative levels of
seed dormancy of Alamo and 746, a Mississippi-collected accession of switchgrass; and 2) the
effect of storage environment, storage duration, and prechilling on germination of these two
switchgrass ecotypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seeds were collected (multiple harvests) in late Sept to early Oct. 1995 and 1996 from
two germplasm sources, NRCS accession 9062746 (746) and Alamo, growing at the Jamie L.
Whitten PMC. Accession 746 was collected as crown pieces in Grenada County, Mississippi in
1992, and the plants appear to conform to the morphological characteristics of an upland ecotype
(Eberhart and Newell, 1959; Sanderson et al., 1996); however, no genetic testing was done to
verify this (Hultquist et al., 1996; Sanderson et al., 1996). In 1996, 746 plants were previously
cut for a forage harvest and seeds were produced on regrowth from the plant crowns. Florets
(seeds) were released from the spikelets by use of a brush machine (Westrup a/s, Slagelse,
Denmark), and a South Dakota Seed Blower (Seedburo Equipment Co., Chicago, IL) was used to
remove chaff and under-developed seeds. After cleaning (<30 days after harvest), initial
germination percentages for each seed lot were determined using five replications of 50 seeds
that were given no pre-treatment prior to testing. Each lot was divided into thirds and placed in
manila seed envelopes for storage. Envelopes of each ecotype were placed in the following
storage environments: 1) Cooler (C) – a seed cooler with a controlled atmosphere of 7 °C with 55
to 60% relative humidity; 2) Room temperature (R) – a laboratory maintained at approximately
21 °C with ambient humidity levels; and 3) Warehouse (W) – an unheated storage facility with
temperatures ranging from approximately -1 to 38 °C with ambient humidity levels. Pre-
germination seed treatments consisted of prechilling (PC) at 7 °C for 14 d prior to germination
testing and no prechilling (NC).
Germination tests were conducted every 2 mo from Dec. to Oct., with the target date
being the first day of the month; however, actual planting dates often varied by several days
from the target date due to scheduling realities. Tests extended over two calendar years, but for
simplicity study years are referred to as 1996 and 1997. Due to multiple seed harvests and the
length of time required for prechilling, storage durations cited are generalizations and do not
