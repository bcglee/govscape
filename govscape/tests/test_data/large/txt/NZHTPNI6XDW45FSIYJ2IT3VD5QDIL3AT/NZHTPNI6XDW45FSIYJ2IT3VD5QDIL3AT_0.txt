Response of Two Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) Ecotypes to Seed
Storage Environment, Storage Duration, and Prechilling1

ABSTRACT
Inconsistent success in establishing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) from seed is a
major factor limiting its use. Freshly harvested seeds exhibit widely varying levels of innate seed
dormancy. Studies were conducted to determine the response of 1995 and 1996 seed lots of
‘Alamo’ and a native collection (746) to storage environment, storage duration, and prechilling
treatments. Initial mean germination of freshly harvested Alamo seeds averaged 24% and 76%
for the 2 yr, whereas germination of 746 seeds were only 1% and <1%. The increased
germination of the 1996 Alamo lot is mainly a factor of reduced innate dormancy levels;
however, there was also an improvement in seed quality. Seeds of 746 responded positively to
both a 14-d cold, moist prechill at 7 °C and higher storage temperatures, experienced in both the
room temperature storage environment (approximately 21 °C) and during the spring and
summer months in the warehouse environment (up to 38 °C). The response decreased with
increased storage duration. Alamo showed little response to either storage environment or
prechilling due to its reduced initial dormancy levels. Some dormancy was retained in 746 seeds
throughout the 11-mo storage period in all environments; however, levels were higher in the
seed cooler environment at 7 °C. Seed lots with an increased level of innate dormancy, such as
746, may require higher storage temperatures or prechilling before planting to ensure
germination. Whereas, seed lots with a lower level of innate dormancy, such as the 1996 Alamo
seed lot, will not benefit from such treatments.
INTRODUCTION
Switchgrass, a warm-season perennial grass native throughout much of the United
States, is an important forage for both cattle and wildlife in the southern states (Grelen and
Hughes, 1984), with significant potential for use as a bioenergy crop (Sanderson et al., 1996).
Switchgrass exhibits a high degree of morphological variability, with two major recognized
categories of ecotypes, upland and lowland, based largely on habitat preferences and some
anatomical and genetic features (Eberhart and Newell, 1959; Hultquist et al., 1996; Sanderson
et al., 1996). ‘Alamo’, a large, robust lowland cultivar, released by the USDA-Natural Resources
