refer to specific time periods. For example, seeds for the Dec. tests were placed in the cooler for
prechilling during Nov., and storage duration for this test date is therefore referred to as 1 mo,
although seeds were actually harvested 1 1/2 to 2 mo prior to the germination test. Treatments
were arranged as a split-split-split plot, with storage environment as a whole plot, ecotype as a
subplot, storage duration as a sub-subplot, and pre-germination seed treatment as a sub-sub-
subplot. Five replications were used, with each consisting of 50 seeds from a single storage/pre-
treatment combination, placed between two layers of moistened filter paper in a petri dish. The
petri dishes were placed in a germinator (Hoffman Manufacturing Co., Albany, OR) for 14 d with
alternating day/night temperature (30/15 °C) and (8 h/16 h) (AOSA,1993). Filter paper was
moistened as needed with distilled water to ensure adequate moisture for germination.
Germinated seeds were counted and discarded at 7 and 14 d (AOSA, 1993). Bewley and Black
(1994) defined germination as emergence of the radicle, signaling the end of the germination
process and the initiation of growth. Similar criteria were used in this study, where an
individual seed was considered germinated when the radicle had protruded through the seed
coat. No attempt was made to determine whether non-germinated seeds were viable. Data were
subjected to an analysis of variance using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) statistical
package (SAS Institute, 1996). Means were separated using Fisher’s protected least significant
difference (LSD) (P=0.05). Because none of the error terms in the model differed significantly
(P<0.05), they were pooled for analyses.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Due to significant interactions between study years and other factors, data from each
year were analyzed separately. Data presented are the total mean germination percentages
after 14 d in the germinator. In 1996, an ice storm during the February testing period (3 mo)
caused a power outage resulting in excessive drying of filter paper in the petri dishes;
consequently this date was excluded from analysis.
Initial germination percentages for 746 were 1% and <1% for the 1995 and 1996 seed
lots, respectively. The forage harvest during 1996 did not appear to affect dormancy levels in
this ecotype. Aho et al. (1989) found that dormancy of ‘Cave-in-Rock’ seeds was not affected by
cutting the plants for an early-season hay crop. Initial germination percentages for Alamo were
24% and 76% for 1995 and 1996 lots, respectively; however, in 1996, seeds in one of the petri
dishes appeared to be adversely affected by an unidentified pathogen; if this replication were
disregarded, initial germination increased to 83%. Sanderson et al. (1996) reported that
recurrent selection for reduced dormancy within Alamo has led to germination rates for freshly
harvested seeds approaching 50%. The initial germination percentage of 76% for the 1996 seed
lot greatly exceeded this value. Location of seed production has been shown to affect dormancy
levels of seeds from individual switchgrass cultivars (Panciera, 1983; Panciera et al., 1987).
Alamo seeds produced in a warm, temperate climate, such as Mississippi, would likely possess
reduced dormancy compared to seeds produced in cooler climates. Also, the seed cleaning
process that removed lighter weight seeds has been shown to have a beneficial effect on
germination percentage (Haynes et al., 1997).
Seed quality of both ecotypes harvested in 1995 was affected by ergot (Claviceps sp.)
infection, and uneven ripening, which increased the number of immature, non-viable seeds. The
South Dakota seed blower was not capable of removing seeds containing ergot and did not
remove all immature seeds. After cleaning, the 746 seed lot contained >37% ergot-infected
seeds. Alamo seeds were less affected by the disease; the seed lot contained only about 3% seeds
with visible ergot. The number of non-viable seeds could not easily be determined, but appeared
to be comparable between the two ecotypes. Both problems may be a function of high
temperatures and low rainfall during the critical seed-ripening period in September 1995 (Table
1). Seeds that were obviously infected with ergot or of poor quality were replaced in the petri
dishes before testing.
