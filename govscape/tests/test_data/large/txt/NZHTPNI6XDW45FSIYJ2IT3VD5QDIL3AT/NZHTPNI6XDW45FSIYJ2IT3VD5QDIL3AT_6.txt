Fig. 3. Mean germination percentages of two switchgrass ecotypes after 14 d in the germinator
as affected by storage duration and pre-germination seed treatment with germination testing
beginning in December 1996 and ending in October 1997. Ecotype 746 is NRCS accession
9062746 collected in Grenada County, MS. Pre-germination seed treatments used were
prechilling (PC) seeds at 7 Â°C for 14 d prior to placement in the germinator and no prechilling
(NC).
It appears that much of the inconsistent germination of switchgrass seeds noted in this
and other studies (Aho et al., 1989; Panciera et al., 1987; Zarnstorff et al., 1994) can be
attributed to switchgrass ecotypes possessing different levels of innate dormancy. Variability
has also been noted between seed lots of a single ecotype produced under different
environmental conditions (Panciera et al., 1987; Zarnstorff et al., 1994). In this study, both seed
sources, although located in PMC fields that were spatially separated to provide required
isolation distance, would have been exposed to virtually identical environmental conditions
during the seed maturation period of each harvest year. However, environmental conditions
varied between seed production years and, for Alamo, dormancy differences were reflected in the
increased initial germination percentage of seeds harvested in 1996, when adequate rainfall and
moderate temperatures occurred prior to harvest (Table 1). No such environmental influence
was shown for the more highly dormant 746 ecotype.
Environmental conditions during storage had a substantial effect on germination of 746
but not Alamo, due to its reduced levels of innate dormancy and the relative rapidity at which
dormancy was overcome. Seeds of 746 harvested in the fall and stored, according to standard
agronomic practice, dry in either a cooler or an unheated warehouse would be expected to retain
a high level of dormancy that would affect establishment if they were to be planted the following
spring. Zhang and Maun (1989) found that germination of dormant switchgrass seeds did not
begin to increase until >26 wk in dry storage. In this study, NC 746 seeds in low-temperature
storage retained much of their dormancy throughout the entire 11-mo study period. Haynes et
al. (1997) found that dormancy was not broken until after 32 mo of dry storage. Producers who
store seeds under cool, dry conditions might find that long storage periods required to relieve
dormancy of seed lots with a high level of innate dormancy could seriously reduce profits that
could be realized from sale of these seeds.
Alternative methods may be required to improve germinability of highly dormant
switchgrass seed lots. Seeds could be stored in a heated building to increase the rate at which
dormancy is overcome; however, this would increase production costs, and there might be a
