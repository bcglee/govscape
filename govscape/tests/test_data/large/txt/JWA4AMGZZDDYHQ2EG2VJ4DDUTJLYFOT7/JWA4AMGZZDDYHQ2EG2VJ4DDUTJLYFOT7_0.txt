Alkali Bulrush (Scirpus maritimus)
Alkali Bulrush is a perennial, heavily rhizomatous wetland plant that is found at low to
mid elevations in marshes, transient wet spots, pond margins, and backwater areas. It
forms large dense stands in alkaline or saline sites. Alkali bulrush can grow in soils with
a pH of up to 9.0, and soil textures from fine clays to silt loams to sands. It can survive
periods of total inundation of up to 1 m deep. It tends to spread and reproduce when the
water table is within 10 cm of the surface. Alkali bulrush can occur on freshwater sites,
but is usually a pioneering species that will be replaced over time with more permanent
species. It is spread by seed and rhizome growth. This species is fairly resistant to fire
which will increase its production and protein content. Currently accepted name is
Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla.
