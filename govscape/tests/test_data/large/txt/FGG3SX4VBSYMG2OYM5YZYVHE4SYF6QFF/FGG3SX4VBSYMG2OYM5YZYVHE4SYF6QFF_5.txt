usda sustainable landscape partnership design charrette final report . 1. 25. 2008
Sustainability Guidance
Inspiration for the charrette came from ASLA staff and
the Sustainable Sites Initiative and included:
Consciousness raising - Think beyond “green roofs.”
Understand the larger concept of the regenerative
quality of the site.
Accessibility and Connection - Implies more than com-
pliance with accessibility standards in all aspects of the
project. It involves a deeper understanding about the
site and communicating this sense of the space - the
logic - to users. (Often by communicating how the site
works and its history). With this deeper understand-
ing, or logic, the user’s comfort level and connection
increases which adds dimension to the whole experi-
ence of the place.
Aim for the goal that nothing should leave the site –
water, soils, materials, or vegetation either during con-
struction or with the on-going use and maintenance of
the site. (e.g. compost gardens to compliment the al-
ready existing cafeteria recycling program.)
Materials - Use local resources or what you find on
site.
Stewardship - Is an interactive process with different
methods of engagement from how the site is used to
teaching. The goal is to instill caring and knowledge to
go forward.
Sense of Place - Capture the history and identity of
USDA in the redesign.
Think bioregional - Think linkage beyond the project
site in order to connect (for example pollinator and
migration pathways) as well as biodiversity. This
also applies to stormwater management since water
sheds are beyond the scope of individual sites.
