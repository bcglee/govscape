INTRODUCTION
The November 30, 2007 Whitten Sustainable Landscape Design
Charrette brought together technical experts in the fields of
landscape architecture, horticulture, forestry, hydrology and
engineering to inspire a vision for the USDA Whitten Building
headquarters on the National Mall in Washington DC - one that
demonstrates environmentally responsible practices, educates
and engages the public via accessible exhibits, provides social
benefits for employees, and serves as a model for other public
institutions in the region.
The November 30, 2007charrette, sponsored by USDA Depart-
mental Administration, was a first effort by the USDA Sustainable
Landscape Partnership to motivate a network around this project
and move closer to realizing its goals to improve USDA National
Capital Region facilities:
• Reduce the environmental impacts of stormwater runoff and
provide wildlife habitat by using environmentally beneficial
landscaping.
• Use the landscape as a demonstration area site for tourists,
visitors, and employees. These living and accessible
educational exhibits will provide an opportunity for the public
to learn about environmental issues, about USDA programs
and initiatives, and what citizens can do in their own
backyards to help the environment.
• Maintain the project as a learning lab for our landscape
contractors by enlisting them to participate as partners and
using that knowledge at other facilities.
• Improve the appearance of the USDA grounds by using
plants and features that will add visual interest to the site.
• Highlight this partnership as a model and the landscape as a
showcase for sustainable site practices in the region.
