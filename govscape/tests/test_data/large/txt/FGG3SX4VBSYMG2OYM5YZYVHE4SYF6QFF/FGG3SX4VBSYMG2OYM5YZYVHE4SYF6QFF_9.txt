usda sustainable landscape partnership design charrette final report . 1. 25. 2008
NORTH GROUP
Facilitator: Glenn Smith, Morgan State
Mike Hill, Virginia Tech
The North Zone includes the area of the
front entrance to the Whitten building and
is the highly visible face of USDA from
the Mall. The entrance is on-axis with the
American History Museum across the
Mall and is also the architectural center of
the building’s symmetrical façade.
The North Zone group was surprised at
the beauty of the “Grand” entrance yet
surprised to find a parking lot directly in
front. The formal plantings are a valid
design complementing the building archi-
tecture, however, intense maintenance
practices are compromising the land-
scape design intent. The group felt that
the entrance and signage for the USDA
visitor center could be improved. They
also wanted to investigate reducing or
moving parking.
Goals for the concept plan:
• Restore historic front entrance
• Remove or relocate front parking to
perimeter
• Reduce stormwater runoff
