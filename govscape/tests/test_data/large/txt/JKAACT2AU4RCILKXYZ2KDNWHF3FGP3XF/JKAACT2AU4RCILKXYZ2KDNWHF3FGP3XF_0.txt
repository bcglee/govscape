Abstract. The traditional trophic cascades model is based on consumer–resource
interactions at each link in a food chain. However, trophic-level interactions, such as

cascades.FromSeptember2001toAugust2004,weusedspatialandseasonalheterogeneityin

interspecific interactions between the two species facilitated the difference in fawn survival.

the abundance of transient coyotes was significantly lower in areas used by wolves. Thus,
differential effects of wolves on solitary coyotes may be an important mechanism by which

coyotes contributes to high rates of coyote predation on pronghorn fawns, and demonstrate
the importance of alternative food web pathways in structuring the dynamics of terrestrial
systems.
