an increasing trend (Berger 2007). Still, for increases in
summer survival of pronghorn fawns to result in an
actual increase in the pronghorn population in GTNP,
several conditions must be met. First, mortality from
coyote predation must be additive and not compensa-
tory (Boyce et al. 1999). We found no evidence of any
compensatory predation-related mortality in radio-
collared fawns (Berger 2007), and prospects for com-
pensatory density-dependent mortality appear unlikely

winter to be recruited into the population as yearlings.
Whereas prospects for density-dependent population
regulation appear unlikely on the summer range,
conditions on the winter range, located on lands
managed by the Bureau of Land Management some
190 km beyond Park borders, strongly differ. Habitat
designated ‘‘crucial winter range’’ for pronghorn
(Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Cheyenne,
Wyoming, USA) is currently undergoing rapid conver-
sion due to development of natural gas wells. As
overwinter survival rates of juvenile ungulates are
typically lower than those of adults (Gaillard et al.
1998), this age class is likely to be differentially
susceptible to any reductions in carrying capacity
stemming from habitat loss. Thus, increases in summer
survival of fawns may be offset by increases in
overwinter mortality, resulting in no net change, or
even a decrease, in the pronghorn population. Third,
fawns surviving their first winter must complete the
return migration the following spring to be recruited
into the Park population. Telemetry data indicate that
approximately80–85%offawnsreturntotheParkeach
year, with the remainder dispersing to other summer
ranges (K. M. Berger, unpublished data). Although
competition for forage could alter the proportion of
fawns showing philopatry to their natal range, this
possibility appears unlikely given the low population
density.
