The first documented occurrences of this disease in

Carolina in 1995. WSSV also has been found in
White Spot Disease wild shrimp and crabs offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico and near shore in Texas, Mississippi,

(U.S.). This is the first occurrence of WSD in
Louisiana and the source of the outbreak is
undetermined. Louisiana is the nation’s largest
producer of crawfish with farmed and wild-caught
crawfish production totaling 95% of the total U.S.
harvest. While there is no export market for Figure 1. Location of WSD Outbreak
Louisiana-produced crawfish, other crustacean
exports from this state were valued at $7 million in
2005. This represented 1.3% of the value of all
U.S. crustacean exports for that year. The U.S. Arkansas
produced approximately 324.8 thousand metric
tons of crustacean products from wild fisheries and
aquaculture sources in 2005, representing 3.26% of
world production. WSD is an OIE-notifiable

freshwater farmed crawfish (Procambarus clarkii)
from St. Martin Parish, Louisiana (see Figure 1).
