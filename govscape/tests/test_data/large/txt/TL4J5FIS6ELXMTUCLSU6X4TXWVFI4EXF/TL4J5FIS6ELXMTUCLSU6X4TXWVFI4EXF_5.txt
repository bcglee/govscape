Males have light tan to brown wings marked with dark,
wavy bands, and a 1.5-inch wingspread. Female moths
are larger than males and generally white, with a wing-
spread of about 2.5 inches. Despite having larger wings,
the female moths cannot fly.

Population Growth and Decline
A number of factors, such as available food sources,
predators, parasites, and disease, affect the size of the
gypsy moth population each year. Depending on the
pest’s population cycle, homeowners may experience
severe gypsy moth infestations for a year or two and then
go several years without noticing any obvious signs of
infestation. Just because the gypsy moth appears to have
disappeared, however, does not mean it’s gone. It may
be present in small numbers 1 year, but before long, the
population cycle will resurge. In the absence of monitoring
and appropriate suppression, the gypsy moth will again
destroy trees and shrubs in infested areas.
