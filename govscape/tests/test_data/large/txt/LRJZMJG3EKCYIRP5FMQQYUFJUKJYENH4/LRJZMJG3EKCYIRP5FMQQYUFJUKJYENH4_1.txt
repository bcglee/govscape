The larvae of Culex mosquitoes prefer to live in
nutrient-rich, organic (often polluted) sites, such
as leakage from septic tanks, abandoned swim-
ming pools, clogged gutters, and similar enriched-
water containers. Culex are generally weak fliers
and do not move far from home, although they
have been known to fly up to two miles. Culex
pipiens are most active during dawn and dusk.
WNV is spread to people by the bite of an infected
mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire WNV when feed-
ing on infected birds that have high levels of WNV
in their blood. The virus replicates and is then
stored in the mosquito's salivary glands before
being transmitted to humans or other animals dur-
ing the mosquito bite.
