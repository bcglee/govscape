Wetlands, Mosquitoes, and West Nile Virus
The purpose of this document is to:
• Provide an understanding of the interaction
between wetlands, mosquitoes, and West Nile
virus (WNV).
• Reduce the fear that wetlands are a primary
breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying
WNV.
• List ways to reduce mosquito-breeding areas
around your home and to prevent mosquito
bites.
