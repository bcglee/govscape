lands are among the most biologically productive
habitats in the world. Wetlands warm quickly in
the spring and produce abundant quantities of
food for amphibians, reptiles, shorebirds, migrat-
ing birds, and waterfowl. Even small sites, much
less than an acre, can produce hundreds of frogs,
toads, and salamanders. Wetlands also provide
critical links to other habitat types and wildlife
populations.
