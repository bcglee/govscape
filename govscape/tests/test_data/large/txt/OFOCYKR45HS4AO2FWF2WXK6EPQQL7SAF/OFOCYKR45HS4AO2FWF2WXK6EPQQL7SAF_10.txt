pests may also increase in corn-to-corn rotations as this system may provide a continual host
environment for some insects and diseases. However, in a corn-soybean rotation, continuously
growing corn for multiple growing seasons can decrease populations of soybean pests, such as
soybean cyst nematode. Thus, corn-to-corn rotations may be used in situations outside of
growing corn for ethanol production, and corn-to-corn rotation has been used prior to the
relatively higher increase in corn for ethanol (Erickson and Lowenberg-DeBoer 2005).
Pesticides Use
Agronomic practices for conventional or GE corn used in food/feed production and ethanol
production for fuel are similar. Corn production typically involves the extensive use of inputs
and technology (Rooney and Serna-Saldivar 1987, Shaw 1988, Pollak and White 1995, White
and Pollak 1995), and the main emphasis is placed on obtaining the best yield (Thomas 2007).
Weed control methods differ depending on a number of factors including locality, grower
resources, and crop trait; the techniques may be direct (e.g. mechanical3 and chemical4) or
indirect (e.g. cultural5) (Olson and Sander 1988). Pest control (weeds and insects) in corn
production is essential in order to obtain good crop yield. Generally, growers will manage a
range of pests simultaneously. Therefore, growers will likely chose from a number of techniques
to effectively and efficiently manage pests in their fields. In 2005, the most prevalent pest
management practice was pesticide use (USDA-ERS 2005). Ultimately, the management
practices utilized by a grower will depend on the types of pests in their field, the level of
infestation, the cropping system, the type of soil, cost, weather, time, and labor. Practices to
cope with pests, nutrient needs, and moisture and temperature requirements vary regionally.
Organic Farming
For this EA, only corn produced using production systems that fall under the USDA National
Organic Program definition of organic farming and are certified organic production systems will
be considered. In organic systems, the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and genetically
engineered crops is strictly limited. Event 3272 corn is not approved for use in organic systems
because it is genetically engineered. Practices growers may use to exclude genetically
engineered products include planting only organic seed, planting earlier or later than neighboring
farmers who may be using GE crops so that the crops will flower at different times, and
employing adequate isolation distances between the organic field and the fields of neighbors to
minimize the chance that pollen will be carried between the fields. Organic growers must also
maintain records to show that production and handling procedures comply with USDA organic
standards.
Certified organic corn acreage is a small percentage of overall corn production. Extrapolating
from the most recent certified organic corn acreage data published in 2005 (USDA-ERS 2008a);
the estimated acreage for certified organic corn in 2007 may be over 220,000 acres, potentially
representing 0.26% of the corn acreage in the US. This calculation assumes the 30% increase in
organic corn acreage between 2004 and 2005 was sustained to 2007. Corn may be produced
using organic practices for ethanol, but on a small scale as a solvent in herbal medicine
manufacturing, and not on large scale biofuel production.
