both animal performance and animal health”.82 The effect of reducing sulfuric acid
use in dry grind ethanol production through the use of Event 3272 corn will enable
feedlot operators to more effectively manage sulfur concentrations and avoid
potential toxicity issues associated with conventional distillers grains.
• Event 3272 provides an additional benefit to the ethanol production process by
increasing solids content in the starch-to-sugar phase. An increased solids/liquid ratio
decreases water use which may also reduce the amount of drying required to
evaporate the water in the stillage to produce a marketable distillers grains product.
Reduced drying requirements may both improve consistency and quality of distillers
grains. One of the most commonly cited problems with DDGS is scorching or
burning that result in darkening of the distillers grains, creating an offensive odor, and
a potential degradation of nutritional properties.83 The use of Event 3272 corn may
enable ethanol producers to avoid these problems.
