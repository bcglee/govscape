Modern U.S. Grain System: Identity Preservation and Co-Existence
A. Factors Enabling Identity Preservation and Co-Existence
The modern U.S. grain system is characterized by identity preservation, product
differentiation, and market segmentation.23 This system has evolved in response to the
development of a variety of specialty grain crops that require some form of segregation from
conventional grain commodities in order to maintain their value to the end users. Examples
include popcorn, waxy (high amylopectin) corn, high oil corn, high protein and modified
protein corn, sweet corn, white corn, blue corn, Indian corn, higher fermentable corn and
high amylose corn.24 As a result, robust identity preservation systems with separate
marketing channels prevent inadvertent commingling of specialty crops.
A number of factors have helped create this segmented market, including
biotechnology, consumer preferences and demand, global concerns for safety and quality,
and the increasing demand for food products originating from diverse sources.25 For
example, the corn wet-milling industry produces starches and sweeteners or syrups tailored
to specific food and industrial uses. This has led to an increased demand for trait-specific
corn types such as high-amylose corn.26
Innovations in transportation, logistics, and information technologies and changes in
the international regulatory environment have also facilitated the marketing of differentiated
grains. Web-based monitoring software can remotely assess the quantity and quality of grain
