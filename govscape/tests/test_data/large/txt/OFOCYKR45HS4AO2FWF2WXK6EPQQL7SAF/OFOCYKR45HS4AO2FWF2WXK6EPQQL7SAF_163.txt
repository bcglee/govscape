Appendix J. Glossary
A
Abiotic Stress Stress due to non-living, environmental factors such as cold, heat,
drought, flooding, salinity, toxic substances, and ultraviolet light.
Agrobacterium A bacterium that causes crown gall disease in some plants. The
tumefaciens bacterium characteristically infects a wound and incorporates a piece
of its own DNA into the host plant genome, causing the host cell to
grow into a tumor-like structure. This DNA-transfer mechanism is
commonly exploited in the genetic engineering of plants.
Agrobacterium The process of DNA transfer from Agrobacterium tumefaciens to
Tumefaciens- plants, which occurs naturally during crown gall disease and can be
mediated used as a method of transformation.
Transformation
Allergen Any substance that causes an allergic reaction.
Alpha-amylase The major form of amylase found in humans and other mammals.
Amylase is the name given to glycoside hydrolase enzymes that break
down starch into glucose molecules.
Anthesis Time at which the corn sheds pollen.
Antibiotic Genes (usually of bacterial origin) used as selection markers in
Resistance Marker transformation because their presence allows cell survival in the
Gene presence of normally toxic antibiotic agents.
Antinutritional or A compound in food or animal feed that has a negative impact on
Antinutritive nutrition or the absorption of nutrients.
Compound
APHIS Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
Archael order In taxonomy, the Thermococcales are an order of the Thermococci, in
Thermococcales the Archaea domain. Archaea are a major division of
microorganisms. Like bacteria, archaea are single-celled organisms
lacking nuclei and are therefore prokaryotes, classified as belonging to
kingdom Monera in the traditional five-kingdom taxonomy. Although
there is still uncertainty in the approximate phylogeny of the groups,
Archaea, Eukaryota and Bacteria are the fundamental classifications in
what is called the three-domain system. Despite being prokaryotes,
archaea are more closely related to eukaryotes than to bacteria.
B
Barren plants Corn plants that do not develop an ear.
Benefical Any organism directly or indirectly advantageous to commodities,
organisms including biological control agents [ISPM No. 3, 2005].
Biotechnology Making specific modifications to the genome of an organism using
techniques based on molecular biology, such as gene manipulation,
gene transfer, DNA typing, and cloning of plants and animals.
Breeding The process of sexual reproduction and production of offspring. Plant
breeding is an applied science for the development of plants suited for
the use of humans, rather than their ability to survive in the wild.
