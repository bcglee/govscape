prevent process disruptions, and ensure industry standards for finished products are
maintained. The use of dedicated supply contracts limits the total supply of food-
quality yellow corn from the open market used in masa production to 4%.63
Commercial hybrid seed companies have specifically developed corn hybrids with
improved alkaline-cooking properties such as hard endosperm corn that have good
yield and are adapted across regions of the U.S. corn belt. These hybrids are
specified by buyers and end-users of corn for masa production and premiums are paid
for growing, delivering, and meeting and maintaining the purity and quality standards
of this corn. In addition to grain sourcing, a number of additional measures are
employed throughout the process including grading, inspection of the corn, cooking
the corn, handling the masa, formulation, and testing of the final food product. These
commonly employed quality control measures ensure that masa products and finished
food products meet industry standards.64 These market controls in the masa industry
make the likelihood of Event 3272 corn being mistakenly delivered directly to a masa
plant by a grower from their farm extremely remote.
Even if corn is somehow diverted to a masa facility, other checks reduce the
possibility of an effect. Syngenta will make available prior to commercialization a
reliable detection method or test that enables crop identity verification for intended
use by corn food processors capable of detecting Event 3272 in any yellow corn
purchased from the open-market, the only possible source of Event 3272 in the corn
supply. Finally, dilution rates would further minimize the possible effect. In the
unlikely event that corn were directly delivered from the farm to a masa facility, it
would be co-mingled in a masa storage bin, and depending on the actual size of the
bin and fullness at the time of delivery, the dilution rate would be a conservative
estimate of 5x. Corn entering a masa facility through a local elevator would be drawn
through two bins and one truck before being used by the facility. The dilution rate
would be approximately 50x, 10x at the local elevator (due to larger bins) and 5x at
the masa storage bin (10x times 5x = 50x).65
63 Approximately 80% of the corn used in masa production is food-quality white corn, while food-quality
yellow corn constitutes only 20% of the total used to produce masa. Both types of corn are typically grown by
producers under contract with major buyers or end-users. In fact, of the 20% drawn from the yellow corn
market, 80% is grown under dedicated supply contracts with the masa plant, leaving only 20% as sourced from
the open market. This means that only 4% of the total supply of corn used in masa production is food-quality
yellow corn from the open market.

65 These dilution factors were calculated based on Syngenta’s interviews with grain merchandisers to
understand the movement of corn and the commingling with other corn that occurs during transport and storage.
This information was further supplemented with Syngenta’s internal analysis of grain dilution patterns.
