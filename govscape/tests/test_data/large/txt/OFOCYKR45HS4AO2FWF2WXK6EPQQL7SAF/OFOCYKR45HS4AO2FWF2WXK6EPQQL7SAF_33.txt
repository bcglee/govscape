of Event 3272 corn grain, containing a thermostable alpha-amylase, for microbial alpha-amylase
in the liquefaction stage of ethanol production. Appendix C contains a report submitted on
behalf of Syngenta, and reviewed by APHIS, that outlines these changes in detail. A brief
summary of the potential changes discussed in the report are identified as issues associated with
Public Health, Animal Feed and DDGS, and Water Use, which are discussed below.
In particular, cooking temperatures may be lowered during the liquefaction stage with Event
3272 corn ethanol production, which potentially may result in decreases in energy usage, and has
the added benefit of increasing ethanol yields. Ultimately, Syngenta believes that the changes
associated with using Event 3272 corn in ethanol processing, instead of adding microbial alpha-
amylase during the process, will result in a 2% or greater increase in ethanol efficiency per
bushel of corn. However, if the efficiency projected by Syngenta is not met, then ethanol
production would likely remain at 2.7 gallons/bushel of corn, as in the “no action” alternative.
Cumulative Effects: Ethanol Production
There are no other petitions submitted for nonregulated status for GE organisms related to
ethanol production. If granted nonregulated status, Event 3272 corn could be the only GE
variety available for ethanol production.
Public Heath
Human Health
Under FFDCA, it is the responsibility of food and feed manufacturers to ensure that the products
they market are safe and properly labeled. Food and feed derived from Event 3272 corn must be
in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. GE organisms for food and
feed may undergo a voluntary consultation process with the FDA prior to release onto the
market.
No Action: Human Health
Syngenta has successfully completed the consultation process with the FDA for Event 3272 corn
(Appendix H). The status of the consultation will not change under the “no action” alternative.
Preferred Alternative: Human Health
Event 3272 corn is genetically engineered to produce a thermostable alpha-amylase. Alpha-
amylases are ubiquitous in the environment, being naturally present in microorganisms, plants
and animals (Janeček et al. 1999). Many types of commercial food processing, feed ingredient
applications, and industrial applications also utilize alpha-amylase enzymes, including the
production of fuel and potable alcohol (brewing, distillation processes), and corn syrups (Janeček
et al. 1999, Lévêque et al. 2000, Pariza and Johnson 2001, Olempska-Beer et al. 2006).
Syngenta provided the FDA with information on identity, function, and characterization of the
genes, as well the expression levels of the gene products. They also provided information on the
potential allergenicity and toxicity of the expressed proteins. The FDA considers Syngenta's
consultation on alpha-amylase Event 3272 corn to be complete (Appendix H). Syngenta also
submitted information on identity, function, characterization of genes, expression levels of gene
products, as well as information on the potential allergenicity and toxicity of the expressed
proteins to APHIS. APHIS’ assessment of the safety of this product for humans and animals
focuses on plant pest risk (USDA-APHIS 2008) and effects on wildlife and threatened and
