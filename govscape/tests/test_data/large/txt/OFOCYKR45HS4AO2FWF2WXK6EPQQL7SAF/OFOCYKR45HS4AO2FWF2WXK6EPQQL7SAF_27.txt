Corn Production
GE and non-GE corn varieties are continually under development. Currently, 80% of the total
corn acres planted in 2008 are GE corn varieties (USDA-NASS 2008a), and over 20% of the
total corn production in 2007 was used for ethanol production (Trostle 2008, USDA-ERS
2008b). In 2008, growers expect to harvest 78.9 million acres for grain, down 9 percent from
2007.

Acreage and Areas of Corn Production
No Action: Acreage and Areas of Corn Production
The amount of GE corn planted in conventional systems in the U.S. is increasing. Of the total
corn acres planted in 2008, 80% were GE corn varieties (USDA-NASS 2008a) up from 73% in
2007 (USDA-NASS 2007a), and 61% in 2006 (USDA-NASS 2006). Conventional production
practices that use GE varieties will continue to increase without granting nonregulated status to
Event 3272 under the “no action” alternative, based on current acreage trends. Currently
available seed for conventional and GE varieties will remain the same under the “no action”
alternative, except Event 3272 corn variety will be unavailable. Corn is currently produced in 49
states (all states but Alaska according to the 2002 Census of Agriculture), and under the “no
action” alternative, this range of production will be unchanged.
Preferred Alternative: Acreage and Areas of Corn Production
In 2008, GE corn production is planted on 80% of all corn acres currently in production in the
US, and the use of GE corn has been steadily increasing over the last 3 years (USDA-NASS
2006, 2007a, 2008a). Conventional and GE corn production occurs on land that is dedicated to
crop production. Most corn is planted in fields that have been in crop production for years.
Granting nonregulated status of Event 3272 corn under the “preferred” alternative is not
expected to significantly alter the range of corn cultivation as the new GE trait (alpha-amylase)
does not change the growth habits compared to conventional varieties (USDA-APHIS 2008).
Additionally, because Event 3272 corn will be marketed for use in ethanol production, this corn
variety will be limited to production areas that surround ethanol production facilities. Currently,
there are 26 states that have corn-based ethanol production facilities, including states with
facilities under construction (see Table 3). This corn variety will likely be introduced to areas
where corn is currently grown for ethanol production as a replacement product to other varieties
(conventional and GE) already available in the market today and used for ethanol production.
Event 3272 corn has the potential to decrease overall corn acreage needed to meet the biofuel
amounts specified in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007. APHIS has analyzed the projections made for ethanol production efficiency
submitted by Syngenta (Appendix C). Due to the changes in ethanol processing when using
Event 3272 corn, Syngenta projects a 2% or greater increase in efficiency, resulting in more
ethanol generated per unit grain than current ethanol processes using microbial alpha-amylase. If
Event 3272 corn does result in greater efficiency during ethanol production, fewer acres of corn
production may be required to meet the biofuel levels mandated by Congress.
