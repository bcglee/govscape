There is one scientific study typically used by critics of GE crops to refute the use of distance as
an isolation strategy. The study found cross-fertilization rates higher at comparable distances
than other studies (Jones and Brooks 1950). For example, Jones and Brooks (1950) found cross-
fertilization to be as high as 2.5 % at 660ft, which is the isolation distance used by AOSCA to
isolate corn fields for seed production (AOSCA 2004). One potential reason for the discrepancy
between this study and almost all other gene flow studies in corn may be due to the type of corn
used in the Jones and Brooks study. Jones and Brooks (1950) investigated the appropriate
isolation distance for seed production in open-pollinated varieties, and not for hybrid varieties.
Due the biology of open-pollinated varieties, these types of plants may be more receptive to
pollen over a longer period of time than hybrid corn plants (Sanvido et al. 2008), allowing for a
greater chance of pollination events. Thus the results from Jones and Brooks (1950) may be an
overestimation of cross-fertilization potential for hybrid corn plants.
WATER USE
Corn plants use a significant amount of water during growth. About 4,000 gallons of water are
needed to produce 1 bushel of corn (NCGA 2007), and in 2007, 13.3 million bushels of corn
were harvested in the U.S (USDA-NASS 2008a). About 20% of corn acres are irrigated, and the
rest of corn acreage only receive the ambient rainfall in a given area (NCGA 2007). Water use is
the same for across agricultural production systems.
Water is also used during ethanol production; about 4.7 gallons of water are needed to produce a
gallon of ethanol (Shapouri and Gallagher 2005). Water is used during the production of
microbial alpha-amylase, as well as during its transport by tanker truck to ethanol plants
(Appendix C).
ANIMAL AND PLANT COMMUNITIES
Animals
Corn fields have been known to be visited by birds, deer and small mammals (e.g. deer mice),
and other types of wildlife species. Although many birds visit row-crop fields such as corn,
numbers are low and few nest there (Patterson and Best 1996). The red-winged blackbird
(Agelaius phoeniceus) is the most abundant bird in North America; they are often initially
attracted to corn fields to feed on insect pests but then feed on the corn. Annually, this bird
destroys over 360,000 tons of field corn and substantial amounts of sweet corn (Dolbeer 1990);
other abundant species of birds that forage and/or nest on and around corn include the horned
lark (Eremophila alpestris), the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), and the vesper sparrow
(Pooecetes gramineus) (Patterson and Best 1996). Deer, such as the white-tailed (Odocoileus
virginianus), find field corn attractive because it functions both as food and cover throughout the
latter half of the growing season (Vercauteren and Hygnstrom 1993). Deer can significantly
damage or completely destroy small corn fields that are surrounded by woody or brushy areas;
however, deer damage to large corn fields is often limited to a few rows closest to the wooded
areas (Neilsen 2005) (Nielsen, 2005). The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is the most
common small mammal in almost any agricultural field (Stallman and Best 1996, Sterner et al.
2003). The deer mouse feeds on a wide variety of plant and animal matter depending on
availability, but primarily feeds on seeds and insects. The deer mouse has been considered
beneficial in agroecosystems because it consumes both weed and pest insect species. The
meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) feeds primarily on fresh grass, sedges, and herbs, but
also on seeds and grains. The meadow vole may also be considered beneficial for its role in the
consumption of weeds, but can be a significant agricultural pest where abundant as they rely on
