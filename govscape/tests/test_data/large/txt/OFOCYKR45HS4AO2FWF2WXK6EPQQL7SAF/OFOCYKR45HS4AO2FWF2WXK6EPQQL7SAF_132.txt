dealers, and transporters (truckers, railroads, and barge lines) are required to establish and
maintain records containing information to help identify the grain product’s immediate
previous sources and the immediate subsequent recipients.47 Guidance from the FDA and
grain industry provides useful, practical guidance on how to deal with commingling, lot code
or numbers, and an adequate description of product to ensure that the recordkeeping
requirements are lawfully met.48
As more fully outlined in the companion white paper detailing these recordkeeping
requirements, the Bioterrorism Act further bolsters identity preservation in the U.S. value-added
grain industry.49
3. American Institute of Baking Quality Systems Management
Program Guide (AIB)
The American Institute of Baking (AIB) is a non-profit corporation, founded in
1919 by the North American wholesale and retail baking industries as a technology center for
bakers and food processors.50 The AIB has introduced to the grain handling industry its
Quality Systems Evaluation (QSE), a comprehensive audit that thoroughly evaluates a
supplier’s quality system.51 The QSE covers such elements as raw materials, process control,
process verification, finished product acceptability, storage and shipping, training, plant
programs, and quality policies. Each grain facility is expected to pass an AIB Food Safety
audit. In 2000, Farmland Grain Division first adopted QSE as its quality management system.
