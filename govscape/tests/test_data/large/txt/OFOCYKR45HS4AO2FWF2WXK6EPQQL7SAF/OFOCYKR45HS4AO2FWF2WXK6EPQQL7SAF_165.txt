GE See Genetically Engineered.
Gene The basic unit of heredity transmitted from generation to generation
during sexual or asexual reproduction; an ordered sequence of
nucleotide bases, comprising of a segment of DNA. A gene contains
the sequence of DNA that encodes an individual RNA or protein.
Gene Expression The process by which a gene produces mRNA and protein and
ultimately exerts its effect on the phenotype of an organism.
Gene Flow The spread of genes from one population to another by the movement
of individuals, gametes, seeds, or spores.
Gene See Introgression.
Introgression
Genetic Genetic engineering refers to the process in which one or more genes
Engineering and other genetic elements from one or more organism(s) are inserted
into the genetic material of a second organism using recombinant DNA
techniques.
Genetically Modified in genotype and, hence, phenotype using recombinant DNA
Engineered (GE) techniques.
GE Organism Genetically engineered organisms. (See Genetically Engineered.)
GE Plant Genetically engineered plant. (See Genetically Engineered.)
Genetic Marker
A gene that is a reliable indicator that a particular organism possesses a
specific trait of interest. Markers may be used to select certain
individual organisms, e.g., cells that have inherited resistance to an
antibiotic will be the only ones in a population that survive an
antibiotic treatment.
Genetic See Transformation.
Transformation
Genome All of the hereditary material in a cell including DNA present in the
cell nucleus, as well as in other locations such as plant chloroplasts and
mitochondria.
Genotype The total genetic makeup that an individual receives from its parents.
Germination The initial stages in the growth of a seed to form a seedling (FAO).
