constant level in all cells of an organism without regard to cell
environmental conditions.
Counterpart A plant variety (or varieties) that represents the closest appropriate
genotype to the transgenic plant in question and is a suitable
control taking into account the breeding history of the transgenic
plant. In some instances, it may be appropriate to use a transgenic
progenitor plant as a counterpart in addition to, or as a substitute
for, a non-transgenic counterpart. (NAPPO, RSPM No. 14, Transgenic
Materials).

DNA See Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
Deoxyribonucleic A nucleic acid that carries the genetic information of a cell. The
Acid structure of DNA is two long chains, consisting of chemical building
blocks called ‘nucleotides,’ twisted into a double helix. The order of
nucleotides determines hereditary characteristics.
Diploid The status of having two complete sets of chromosomes, most
commonly one set of paternal origin and the other of maternal origin.
Somatic tissues of higher plants and animals are ordinarily diploid in
chromosome constitution, in contrast with the haploid gametes (FAO).
Donor An organism that provides a gene or gene fragment used in the genetic
transformation of another organism, called the “recipient.”
Dry-grind ethanol In dry milling, the entire corn kernel or other starchy grain is first
process ground into flour, which is referred to in the industry as "meal" and
processed without separating out the various component parts of the
grain. In contrast, wet-milling involves soaking or steeping the grain
in water and dilute sulfurous acid for 24 to 48 hours. (RFA website
