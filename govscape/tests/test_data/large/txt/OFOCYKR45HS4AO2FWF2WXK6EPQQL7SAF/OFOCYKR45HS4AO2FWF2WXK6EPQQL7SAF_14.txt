GE organisms for food and feed may undergo a voluntary consultation process with the FDA
prior to release onto the market. Although a voluntary process, applicants who wish to
commercialize a GE variety that will be included in the food supply complete a consultation with
the FDA. In a consultation, a developer who intends to commercialize a bioengineered food
meets with the agency to identify and discuss relevant safety, nutritional, or other regulatory
issues regarding the bioengineered food and then submits to FDA a summary of its scientific and
regulatory assessment of the food; FDA evaluates the submission and responds to the developer
by letter. For a list of completed consultations on GE organisms, see
http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/biocon.html (access September 7, 2008).
Another potential concern is worker safety, both on the farm and at the ethanol plant. Farmers
use an array of chemicals, including insecticides and herbicides, which may have toxic properties
during application. Ethanol plant workers deal with hazardous chemicals such as sulfuric acid
and liquid ammonia during the processing of corn grain to ethanol and DDGS.
GENE MOVEMENT
Gene movement to other corn plants
Corn plants are pollinated through wind movement of pollen to other receptive corn plants. In
the U.S., there are no other species that can be pollinated by corn pollen without human
intervention (e.g., manually forcing reproduction in the laboratory) (USDA-APHIS 2008). Thus,
the public concern surrounding gene movement for GE corn is between GE and non-GE corn
plants. Currently, 80% of the conventionally grown corn in the U.S. is GE corn (USDA-NASS
2008a). Specialty corn, those with traits of particular interest to various markets such as blue
corn, waxy corn or organic corn, are typically grown with various management practices that
intend to limit corn pollen from reaching the specialty corn crop during the period of time that
the specialty corn crop is receptive to pollen. For example, the NOP has requirements for
organic plans to address pollen flow from GE crops (Kuepper 2002, Krueger 2007, Kuepper et
al. 2007). The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA) also has information
for specialty corn crops, and a protocol for growing non-GE corn (AOSCA 2008). There is a
price premium associated with growing these types of specialty crops in conjunction with the
extra regimens in place to maximize the purity of these specialty crops. For example, in 2007,
conventional corn averaged $4.00/bushel (USDA-NASS 2008b), whereas organic corn averaged
$10.00/bushel (Alexander 2007).
A recent paper reviewed studies investigating gene flow and cross-fertilization studies in corn
grain production fields, and using the data from these studies recommended 50m (approx. 164ft)
as the distance needed to isolate GE corn and non-GE corn (Sanvido et al. 2008). The authors
limited their analysis to studies that confirmed fertilization in the non-GE corn plants, and
excluded studies on pollen dispersal (e.g., (Raynor et al. 1972, Di Giovanni et al. 1995, Aylor et
al. 2003) that only measured pollen flow, because pollen flow does not necessarily result in
fertilization. Successful cross-fertilization requires many different biological and physical
factors, such as synchrony of flowering between corn fields, viability of pollen, and presence of
physical barriers, and thus pollen dispersal is not equivalent to cross fertilization. Sandivo et al.
(2008) analysis of the existing studies found that the cross-fertilization rate in non-GE corn
typically remained below 0.5% at this distance, and this result was validated when analyzing
cross-fertilization events in large scale studies (e.g. (Henry et al. 2003, Weber et al. 2007).
