Gene Movement section below for further discussion and Appendix D). If corn growers using
Event 3272 corn follow the mandatory measures, APHIS has determined that these additional
measures to minimize pollen flow would decrease the likelihood of GE pollen movement into
those corn fields that are growing non-GE corn (see Gene Movement section below for further
discussion and Appendix D). However, even if growers of Event 3272 corn failed to use the
mandated isolation techniques in the Stewardship Agreement, there is no indication that any
current pollen flow from GE corn to non-GE corn has dampened the organic production of corn.
Currently, the use of GE corn varieties and the use of organic corn production systems are both
increasing due to market demands, and these markets will likely continue to increase under the
“preferred” alternative.
Cumulative Effects: Coexistence
Under the “no action” alternative and under the “preferred” alternative, granting nonregulated
status to Event 3272 corn will not change the market demands for GE corn or corn produced
using organic methods. Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn will add another GE
corn variety to the market. However, adding GE varieties to the market is not related to the
ability of organic production systems to maintain their market share. Between 2001 and 2005,
although 5 GE corn varieties were granted nonregulated status, the acreage associated with the
organic production of corn rose 35% (USGC 2006).
Specialty Corn
Specialty corn, such as waxy corn, white corn, blue corn, and organic corn, comprises 8% of the
U.S. market (USGC 2006). These specialty corn products intensively use systems to maintain
the purity of the corn product, based on the demands of the end-user (e.g., food processing
plant). Systems used by specialty corn growers and end-users include to maintain identity of the
production include contracts, tracking and traceability systems, quality assurance processes,
closed-loop systems, and identity preservation systems.
No Action: Specialty Corn
The availability of methods used to separate specialty corn products from corn used as grain
would be the same as currently used in corn production systems under the “no action”
alternative.
Preferred Alternative: Specialty Corn
Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn under the “preferred” alternative would not
change the availability of using closed-loop systems for specialty corn production. For Event
3272 corn, as a specialty corn variety, the closed-loop system will be used extensively to
maintain the identity and value of the product for the grower, who is obtaining a price premium
from the ethanol producer, and the ethanol producer, who is paying the premium. There is no
benefit to either party if Event 3272 corn is mistakenly routed to a non-ethanol facility.
However, there is the potential for misdirection of Event 3272 corn in the transportation stream.
Because Event 3272 corn has successfully completed the food and feed consultation process with
FDA (Appendix H), there are no human health concerns if Event 3272 corn enters the food
supply (see section on Public Health below for more discussion). However, because of the
thermostable properties of the alpha-amylase, Event 3272 corn may have undesirable effects in
certain types of processed food products, similar to what may happen if other types of specialty
