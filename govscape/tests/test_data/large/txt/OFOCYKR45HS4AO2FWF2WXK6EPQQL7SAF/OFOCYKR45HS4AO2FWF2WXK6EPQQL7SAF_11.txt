Agricultural production systems may effect the surrounding environment, and corn production is
no different. Depending on the region and practices used, corn production includes inputs such
as fertilizer (e.g., synthetic fertilizers, manure, and compost containing nitrogen and phosphorus)
and pesticides (synthetic or NOP-approved insecticides, herbicides and fungicides), as well as
irrigation. Each of these inputs can effect the environment including, but not limited to,
increasing nutrient pollution in waterways, alterations in biodiversity due to pesticide inputs, and
depletion of the water table or increased salinity in the fields due to irrigation.
SPECIALTY CORN SYSTEMS
The vast majority of corn grown in the U.S. is grown as grain for animal feed. However,
approximately 8% of corn grown is specialty corn produced for a specific market or use (USGC
2006). Examples of specialty corn include white corn, waxy corn, hard endosperm, high oil,
non-GE, and organic corn (USGC 2006). The uses of these corn varieties include human
consumption, food processing (waxy corn) or specialty product (white corn, blue corn). These
corn varieties are specified by buyers and end-users of corn for production, and premiums are
paid for delivering a product that meets purity and quality standards for the corn variety. Product
differentiation and market segmentation in the specialty corn industry includes mechanisms to
keep track of the grain (traceability), methods for identity preservation (IP, including closed-loop
systems), and quality assurance processes (e.g., ISO9001-2000 certification), as well as contracts
between growers and buyers that specify delivery agreements.
ETHANOL PRODUCTION
Ethanol, also known as grain alcohol or ethyl alcohol, is the type of alcohol produced by
fermenting and distilling simple sugars from biological sources. It is the same kind of alcohol
found in all alcoholic beverages, although commercial ethanol plants add a poison (two to five
percent) to make it unfit for human consumption (Morris and Hill 2006). More than 90 % of
U.S. ethanol is made from corn (Morris and Hill 2006).
Over 20% of the 2007 corn production was used for ethanol production (Trostle 2008, USDA-
ERS 2008b). Commercial ethanol production uses conventional or GE corn; organic corn
production for ethanol is typically small scale production for herbal medicinal use. The amount
of GE corn currently used for ethanol production is not tracked by the USDA National
Agricultural Statistics Survey. However, biotechnology-derived varieties make up 80% of corn
acreage in the U.S. (USDA-NASS 2008a), suggesting that GE corn is currently used in ethanol
production.
The Federal Energy Act of 2005 includes a nationwide renewable fuels standard (RFS) that will
result in the use of more than 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel by 2012 (42 USC
15801, page 1069). The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 passed in December,
2007, includes a provision to expand consumption of alternative fuels, including but not limited
to ethanol, to 36 billion gallons in 2022. As of July 8, 2008, there were currently 161 operational
ethanol plants with a capacity of 9.3 billion gallons per year (bgy) (www.ethanolrfa.org, Figure
1). Another 42 plants are under construction, and 7 are under expansion (Figure 1). The
completion of these projects would bring the total ethanol capacity to 13.6 bgy
(www.ethanolrfa.org).
