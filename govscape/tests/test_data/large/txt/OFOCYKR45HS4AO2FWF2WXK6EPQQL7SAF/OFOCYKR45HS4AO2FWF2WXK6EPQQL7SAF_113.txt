By blending the border rows with the harvested CA corn, >99.9% of all CA is captured. For
example, assume 100 acres of CA is planted and 170 acres of NCA is planted adjacent to the
CA corn to achieve the 200 meters distance cited by Ma (Figure 1).
With yields of 180 bushels per acre (bpa), the total production of CA would be:
100 CA acres x 180 bpa = 18,000 CA bushels
170 NCA acres x 180 bpa = 30,600 NCA bushels x 0.19% adventitious CA = 58 bushels
Total CA bushels from 100 acre CA field and 170 acre NCA field = 18,058 bushels
With 12 border rows the CA production beyond the 12 border rows is 1.5 bushels (170 acres
x 180 bpa x 0.005% adventitious CA). Therefore, the total CA capture is 18,058 bushels less
the 1.5 bushels divided by 18,058 = 99.99%.
