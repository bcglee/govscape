that 80% of corn production is GE, the DDGS produced and used as animal feed are likely
produced with some GE corn varieties.
Because of the near complete fermentation of starch during the ethanol process, the remaining
amino acids, fat, minerals and vitamins in DDGS increase approximately three-fold in
concentration compared to levels found in corn (Rausch and Belyea 2006). This can result in
concerns regarding phosphorous and animal waste dispose, sulfur diet content, and mycotoxin
concentrations in DDGS.
No Action: Animal Feed - DDGS
Under the “no action” alternative, DDGS will still be produced during ethanol production.
Concerns will still surround DDGS nutritional content in terms of increased phosphorus
concentration and the disposal of the resulting animal waste, high sulfur diet content, and
increased mycotoxin concentrations as discussed in Section II. The successful completion of the
consultation with FDA for Event 3272 corn (Appendix H) is not changed under the “no action”
alternative.
Preferred Alternative: Animal Feed - DDGS
DDGS are currently made with GE corn, so the use of a new GE corn variety in ethanol
production will not change the availability of GE DDGS as an animal feed. Syngenta has
completed the consultation process on Event 3272 corn with FDA (Appendix H), and Event
3272 corn is considered safe for use in food and feed.
Overall, the use of Event 3272 corn is not anticipated to change the composition of DDGS.
Ethanol production experiments at a laboratory scale conducted with Event 3272 corn found no
difference in DDGS produced with conventional corn and with Event 3272 corn (Singh et al.
2006). However, the experiments were run using only 3% of Event 3272 corn during the ethanol
processing, and no comparisons of DDGS composition were conducted using 100% Event 3272
corn.
The use of Event 3272 corn in ethanol production is not anticipated to change the phosphorous or
mycotoxin concerns surrounding the use of DDGS as animal feed, as discussed in Section II.
However, if the use of Event 3272 corn in ethanol production decreased the use of sulfuric acid,
the resultant DDGS may have a reduced sulfur content. This reduction in sulfur content in
DDGS is a potential benefit as DDGS produced using the current ethanol production process
could have a sulfur content that results in toxicity to animals (Rausch and Belyea 2006).
Under the “preferred” alternative, Event 3272 corn would be available for ethanol processing,
and has the potential to alleviate the concerns surrounding sulfur content in DDGS, an ethanol
by-product used for animal feed. If the reductions in sulfuric acid during ethanol processing due
to Event 3272 corn are not realized, the use of Event 3272 corn is still safe for food and feed use,
including DDGS (Appendix H).
Cumulative Effects: Animal Feed - DDGS
DDGS are currently made with GE corn, so the use of a new GE corn variety in ethanol
production will not change the availability of GE DDGS as an animal feed. Syngenta has
completed the consultation process on Event 3272 corn with FDA (Appendix H), and Event
