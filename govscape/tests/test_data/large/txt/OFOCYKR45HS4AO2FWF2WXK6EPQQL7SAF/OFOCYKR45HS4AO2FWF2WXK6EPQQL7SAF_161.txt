Impact of Event 3272 on Distillers grains
While efficiencies from Event 3272 are gained throughout the ethanol production process,
the greatest benefits are realized within the starch-to-sugar conversion phase. The most
apparent of these benefits is the elimination of microbial alpha-amylase as a raw material
input. Alpha-amylase is used to break down the starch component of the corn into short
chain dextrins, or complex sugars. Glucoamylase is then added during saccharification to
further break down dextrins into simple sugars that can be fermented into ethanol. Because
the alpha-amylase enzyme is already present in the corn kernel of Event 3272, this input is
eliminated from the process.
The alpha-amylase enzyme produced by Event 3272 catalyzes the same reaction as other
microbial alpha-amylases. The enzyme, whether exogenously introduced in microbial form
or provided by the corn via Event 3272, only directly affects the conversion of starch to
sugar, which eventually becomes ethanol. Use of Event 3272 corn is unlikely to have any
adverse impact on the composition or quality of the coarse grain (distillers grains) or solubles
left after distillation that, when added to distillers grains, become DDGS.
However, the use of Event 3272 corn will provide important efficiencies to the ethanol
production process that may result in direct benefits to the distillers grains produced from
Event 3272 corn.
• The first of these is a reduction by half in sulfuric acid used to maintain pH levels.
When conventional yellow corn is used in a dry grind plant, pH must be adjusted at
several stages to create optimal conditions for chemical reactions to take place. With
Event 3272 corn, pH is maintained at a constant level of approximately 4.8
throughout the production process. This reduces the use of sulfuric acid by half.
Sulfuric acid ultimately becomes a sulfur salt in the DDGS product. According to
research conducted at the University of Minnesota the sulfur content of distillers
grains can be both very high and highly variable. “If not managed properly, high S
concentrations in the diet, coupled with S from drinking water, may negatively affect
