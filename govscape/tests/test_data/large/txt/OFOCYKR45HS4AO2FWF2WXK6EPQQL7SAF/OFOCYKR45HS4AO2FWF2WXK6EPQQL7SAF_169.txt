flower pollinating itself. (See Outcrossing.)
Senescence A late stage in the development of multicellular organisms, during
which irreversible loss of function and degradation of biological
components occur. The physiological ageing process in which cells
and tissues deteriorate and finally die (FAO).
Southern analyses
Southern corn leaf Corn disease caused by the fungus Bipolaris maydis
blight
Stably integrated
Stratification Chilling or warming seeds, for a period of time, to improve
germination.
Sympatric
Species undergoing sympatric speciation are not geographically
populations
isolated by, for example, a mountain or a river. The diverging
populations generally share the same territory. (wiki)
Synergy
The interaction of two or more factors so that their combined effect is
greater than the sum of their individual effects.
T
TES Threatened and Endangered Species.
Tetraploid An organism, or a tissue whose cells contain four haploid sets of
chromosomes (FAO)
Thermostable A molecule which retains its biological activity at some specified
higher temperature (FAO)
Trait A characteristic of an organism that manifests itself in the phenotype.
Traits may be the result of a single gene or may be polygenic, resulting
from the simultaneous expression of more than one gene.
Transformant A cell or organism that has been genetically altered through the
integration of a transgene(s). A “primary” transformant is the first
generation following the transformation event.
Transformation The uptake and integration of DNA in a cell’s genome, in which the
introduced DNA is intended to change the phenotype of the recipient
organism in a predictable manner.
Transformation A single successful integration of a gene or gene fragment into a cell or
Event a successful deletion of a gene or gene fragment from a cell.
Transgene A foreign gene that is inserted into the genome of a cell via
recombinant DNA techniques.
Transgenic An organism whose genome has been modified via the stable
Organism incorporation of a piece of foreign DNA (a transgene).
U
V
Vector
The agent, such as a plasmid, used by researchers to carry new genes
into cells.
Vigor A measure of plant growth, health and robustness during the vegetative
growth stage
