derived hybrids and controls for protein and manganese, which were higher in event 3272-
derived hybrids than near-isogenic control hybrids. Syngenta also reported statistically
significant differences in the mean values of carbohydrates, total dietary fiber, neutral
detergent fiber, vitamin B , Î²-carotene, inositol, and ferulic acid, which were lower in event
6
3272-derived
hybrids. Event 3272-derived hybrids had significantly higher levels of almost all amino
acids compared to the near-isogenic control lines, with the exception of arginine, cysteine,
and lysine which were not different. Syngenta has compared all mean values to published
literature ranges and concludes differences between event 3272-derived and near-isogenic
control hybrids are not biologically meaningful.
7. Wholesomeness Study
Syngenta reports results from a 42-day broiler chicken feeding study comparing birds fed
event3272 grain versus the near-isogenic control and commercially-available corn. Syngenta
indicates that all of the diets derived from treatment and control diets supported rapid growth
9
with low mortality rates and excellent feed conversion ratios. Syngenta also reports no
evidence of biologically-significant differences in growth or feed conversion in chickens fed
event-3272 grain compared to near-isogenic control or commercially available corn.
Furthermore, Syngenta notes the absence of any adverse nutritional or toxic effects in
chickens fed these diets.
8. Conclusions
Syngenta has concluded that AMY797E alpha-amylase corn event 3272 is not materially
different in composition, safety, or any other relevant parameter from corn now grown,
marketed, and consumed. At this time, based on Syngenta's data and information, the
agency
considers Syngenta's consultation on AMY797E alpha-amylase corn event 3272 to be
complete.

The term genotype is used by Syngenta to refer only to the presence or absence of
Event 3272.

Syngenta defines hybrid pairs as the result of an initial cross-breeding of event 3272 and a
non-transgenic line followed by self-crossing or cross-breeding of the resulting progeny one
or more times and the selection of homozygous trait positive and negative segregants.
