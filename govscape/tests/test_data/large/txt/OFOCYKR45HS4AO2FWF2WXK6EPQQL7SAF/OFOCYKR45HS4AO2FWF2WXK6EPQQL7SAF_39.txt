taken by farmers who use organic production practices. No acreage data for corn production
under organic methods is available since 2005, thus no further trend comparisons were
conducted.
Based on the 2005 information, if growers of Event 3272 corn fail to use the separation
techniques mandated in their contract with Syngenta, there is no indication that any pollen flow
from GE corn to non-GE corn would dampened the organic production of corn. Acreage using
GE varieties has increased by 40% since 2005, and there is no corresponding data for acres of
corn production under organic methods.
Cumulative Effect: Gene Movement
Event 3272 corn would be an additional GE corn variety that may be available to the farming
community. The production area for Event 3272 corn is likely limited to areas in 26 states that
have ethanol production facilities because this GE corn variety has been specifically developed
for that purpose. The majority of ethanol plants are in the ‘corn belt’ of the U.S., where the most
of the U.S. field corn is grown. There is available GE acreage data (in parentheses) for the
following corn belt states that also have ethanol facilities: Indiana (78%), Iowa (84%), Illinois
(80%), Ohio (66%), South Dakota (95%), Nebraska (86%), Kansas (90%), Minnesota (88%),
Wisconsin (75%), Michigan (72%), and Missouri (70%). GE corn is currently being grown for
use in ethanol plants, although data is unavailable as to the percent of GE compared to non-GE
corn used in ethanol facilities.
Water Use in Ethanol Production
Ethanol production is an integral part of meeting the renewable fuels standard (RFS) in the U.S.
More than 90 % of U.S. ethanol is made from corn (Morris and Hill 2006). Ethanol production
typically uses 4.7 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of ethanol (Shapouri and Gallagher 2005).
Water is also used during the manufacturing and transport of microbial alpha-amylase for
conventional ethanol production.
No Action: Water Use in Ethanol Production
Under the “no action” alternative, there is no change in the conventional processes used for
ethanol production. Water would still be used during the manufacturing and transport of
microbial alpha-amylase for conventional ethanol production, and approximately 4.7 gallons of
water would be used to produce 1 gallon of ethanol.
Preferred Alternative: Water Use in Ethanol Production
The use of Event 3272 corn could result in the water conservation in two ways. There is a
potential for a decrease in water usage during ethanol production during the saccharification
phase due to the properties of Event 3272 corn (Appendix C). However, large-scale ethanol
plant research and development have not verified this potential savings. Thus, the use of Event
3272 corn may result in the same water use in ethanol production as now [4.7 gallons of water
for 1 gallon of ethanol, (Shapouri and Gallagher 2005)].
Currently, water is intensively used during the production of microbial alpha-amylase and
microbial alpha-amylase is also transported to the ethanol facility in a water solution. If Event
3272 corn was used in ethanol production, water usage could be reduced because microbial
