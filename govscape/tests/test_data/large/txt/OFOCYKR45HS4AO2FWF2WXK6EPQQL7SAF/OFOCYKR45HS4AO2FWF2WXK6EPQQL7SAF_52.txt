COMPLIANCE WITH CLEAN WATER ACT AND CLEAN AIR ACT
This Environmental Assessment evaluated the changes in corn production due to the unrestricted
use of Event 3272 corn. Event 3272 corn will not lead to the increased production of corn in
U.S. agriculture. There is no expected change in water use due to the production of Event 3272
corn, nor is it expected that air quality will change to do the production of Event 3272 corn. If
APHIS grants nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn, APHIS will be fully compliant with the
Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.
