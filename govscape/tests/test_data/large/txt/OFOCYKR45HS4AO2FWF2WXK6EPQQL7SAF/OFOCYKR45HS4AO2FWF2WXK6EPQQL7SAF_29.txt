such as alfalfa or soybean) (Sawyer 2007). Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn will
not change the cumulative effects found under the “no action” alternative, because the use of
corn-to-corn rotation is based on economic decisions by the farmer and is not dependent on the
corn varieties (GE or conventional) available on the market.
Tillage
No Action: Tillage
The use of tillage and the removal of soil residue are considered agriculture practices that
accentuate loss of soil organic carbon (Lal and Bruce 1999). As described in Section II, this loss
has negative impacts on the atmosphere and increases soil erosion, among others. Under the “no
action” alternative, the use of tillage methods in U.S. agricultural production of corn will remain
unchanged.
Preferred Alternative: Tillage
Event 3272 corn does not change cultivation practices, including tillage, for corn production.
Agronomic practices used during the production of corn for ethanol use is the same as the
production of corn for grain. Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn will not change
the loss of soil organic carbon due to tillage in corn production systems.
Cumulative Effects: Tillage
The cumulative effects of tillage include removal of soil residues over time (Lal and Bruce 1999,
Triplett and Dick 2008). This cumulative effect of tillage will continue, independent of the
status of Event 3272 corn. Event 3272 corn will not change the amount of corn acreage tilled,
because it will not effect corn acreage in the U.S., or change the management of corn fields
because it will require the same agronomic practices as other conventional corn varieties.
Pesticide Use
No Action: Pesticide Use
Under the “no action” alternative, corn production, and pesticide use in corn, will remain as it is
practiced today by the farming community. Growers make choices to use certain pesticides
based on weed and disease pressures, cost of seed and other inputs, technology fees, human
safety, potential for crop injury, and ease and flexibility of the system (Olson and Sander 1988,
Giannessi 2005). Therefore, when taking into account these factors, growers will ultimately base
their choice on individual wants and needs. As an example of the pesticides used during the
production of field corn, the Pesticide Action Network has an online database, including a
detailed description of all the pesticides used in corn agriculture in California (Kegley et al.
2008). It lists the top 50 pesticides (e.g., herbicides, insecticides, fungicides) using in California
corn production. Any effects due to pesticide use in the agricultural production of corn will
remain the same under the “no action” alternative.
Preferred Alternative: Pesticide Use
Event 3272 corn production uses the same agricultural inputs (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers) as corn
currently grown for the ethanol production market. Event 3272 corn, and the alpha-amylase
produced by Event 3272 corn has no effect on the types of pesticides that will be used in corn
production. Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn will not have any effect on the
pesticides used in the production of corn in the U.S., compared to the “no action” alternative.
Cumulative Effects: Pesticide Use
