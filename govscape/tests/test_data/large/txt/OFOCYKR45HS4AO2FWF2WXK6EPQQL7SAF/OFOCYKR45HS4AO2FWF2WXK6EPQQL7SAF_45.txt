contains 1627 µg/g fresh weight of alpha-amylase in the dough stage (Table 3-3, page 44 of
Petition). According to Wolt and Karaman (2007), approximately 1% of grain is lost during
harvest, which falls to the ground in the field. These grain residues will need to degrade prior to
the release of AMY797E into soil. Thus, grain left in the field does not immediately result in the
increased amounts of alpha-amylase in soil. The study does also not test the activity of
AMY797E in soil, or if AMY797E is likely to be active in agricultural soils. AMY797E, like
other enzymes, have specific requirements as to substrate availability, inducers, availability of
other nutrients, physical and chemical parameters such as moisture, temperature, and pH. These
characteristics vary in time and space and from one microenvironment to another. Additionally,
according to Syngenta, AMY797E is constructed for maximum activity at 176ºF (80ºC), and
only has 10% of its maximal activity under 86ºF (30ºC). None of these factors were considered
in the estimations and conjecture of potential contributes of AMY797E to alpha-amylase levels
in the soil by Wolt and Karaman (2007).
Conservation Reserve Program
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), administered by the USDA, is the largest private-
lands conservation program in the U.S. According to the Farm Service Agency,
“CRP plantings and practices offer our nation vast environmental benefits, including
reducing soil erosion, improving surface and ground water quality, creating wildlife
habitat, restoring wetlands, sequestering carbon, preserving soil productivity, and
reducing offsite wind erosion damages. Some of CRP’s substantial 2007
accomplishments include:
• Reducing runoff of sediment (207 million tons), nitrogen (480 million pounds),
and phosphorus (108 million pounds) from agricultural soils.
• Restoring and protecting 2.1 million acres of wetlands and adjacent buffers.
• Establishing 1.9 million acres of grass and forested buffers along the nation’s
rivers and streams.
• Improving populations of Prairie Pothole ducks, ring-necked pheasants, sage
grouse, bobwhite quail, and other grassland birds.
• Sequestering over 50 million tons of carbon.” (USDA-FSA 2007)
There is public concern that the demand for ethanol production, and subsequent corn prices, are a
catalyst resulting in removing acreage from the Conservation Reserve Program to place into corn
production (Hart 2006).
No Action: Conservation Reserve Program
Acres removed or maintained in the Conservation Reserve Program will not be affected under
the “no action” alternative. Demands for ethanol production and corn prices may still result in
growers removing acres from the CRP and placing them into corn production, under the “no
action” alternative.
Preferred Alternative: Conservation Reserve Program
As stated in Section II, the demands for ethanol production and increased corn prices may still
result in growers removing acres from the CRP and place them into corn production,
independent of granting Event 3272 nonregulated status. Because Event 3272 corn may provide
a potential increase in ethanol production efficiency (Appendix C), fewer acres of corn
production may be needed to meet ethanol demands if Event 3272 corn is an available variety. If
ethanol demands could be met with fewer acres of corn production, this may translate into less
