inventories in a supplier’s storage facilities. Communication networks and increased reliance
on the Internet are cutting the costs of differentiation.27 The implementation of the European
Union food traceability and labeling directives28 and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety29
have compelled agribusinesses, particularly grain elevators and grain warehouses at the front
of the supply chain, to track closely shipments and supplies.30
B. Identity Preservation Tools
Identity preservation or product differentiation relies on source verification –
traceability, product tracking, and process verification. Traceability then is an important tool
that “helps facilitate the identification of product(s) and/or batches.”31 Agricultural
traceability has been defined as the
collection, documentation, maintenance, and application of
information related to all processes in the supply chain in a
manner that provides guarantees to the consumer and other
stakeholders on the origin, location, and life history of a
product as well as assisting in crises management in the event
of a safety and quality breach.32

Crops, Food, and Feed in the European Union , 1 J. OF FOOD L. & POL'Y 43 (2005) (discussing

29 The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety was adopted on January 29, 2000, signed by 107 parties, and by
September 2003 was ratified by 50 countries, the minimum required for the Protocol to enter into force.
Countries that ratified the Protocol became Parties to the Protocol and are required to comply with and
implement all of its provisions. Countries that have not signed but that export Living Modified Organisms
(LMOs) to member countries are encouraged to comply with the Protocol’s provisions implemented in the
importing country.
