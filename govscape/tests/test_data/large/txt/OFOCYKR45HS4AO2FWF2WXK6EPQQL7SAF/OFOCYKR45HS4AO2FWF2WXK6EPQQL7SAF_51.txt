the U.S., its territories, and possessions that result from actions being taken. APHIS has given
this due consideration and does not expect a significant environmental impact outside the U.S.
should nonregulated status be granted to Event 3272 corn. It should be noted that all the
considerable, existing national and international regulatory authorities and phytosanitary regimes
that currently apply to introductions of new corn cultivars internationally, apply equally to those
covered by an APHIS determination of nonregulated status under 7 CFR part 340. Any
international traffic of Event 3272 corn subsequent to a determination of nonregulated status for
the product would be fully subject to national phytosanitary requirements and be in accordance
with phytosanitary standards developed under the International Plant Protection Convention
(IPPC).
The purpose of the IPPC “is to secure a common and effective action to prevent the spread and
introduction of pests of plants and plant products and to promote appropriate measures for their
control” (IPP 2008); the protection it affords extends to natural flora and plant products and
includes both direct and indirect damage by pests, including weeds. The IPPC set a standard for
the reciprocal acceptance of phytosanitary certification among the nations that have signed or
acceded to the Convention (169 countries as of September 2008). In April 2004, a standard for
pest risk analysis (PRA) of living modified organisms (LMOs) was adopted at a meeting of the
governing body of the IPPC as a supplement to an existing standard, International Standard for
Phytosanitary Measure No. 11 (ISPM-11, Pest Risk Analysis for Quarantine Pests). The standard
acknowledges that all LMOs will not present a pest risk and that a determination needs to be
made early in the PRA for importation as to whether the LMO poses a potential pest risk
resulting from the genetic modification. APHIS pest risk assessment procedures for genetically
engineered organisms are consistent with the guidance developed under the IPPC. In addition,
issues that may relate to commercialization and transboundary movement of particular
agricultural commodities produced through biotechnology are being addressed in other
international forums and through national regulations.
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is a treaty under the United Nations Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD) that established a framework for the safe transboundary movement,
with respect to the environment and biodiversity, of LMOs, which includes those modified
through biotechnology. The Protocol came into force on September 11, 2003, and 147 countries
are Parties to it as of September 1, 2008 (CBD 2008) . Although the U.S. is not a party to the
CBD, and thus not a party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, U.S. exporters will still need
to comply with domestic regulations that importing countries that are Parties to the Protocol have
put in place to comply with their obligations. The first intentional transboundary movement of
LMOs intended for environmental release (field trials or commercial planting) will require
consent from the importing country under an advanced informed agreement (AIA) provision,
which includes a requirement for a risk assessment consistent with Annex III of the Protocol, and
the required documentation.
LMOs imported for food, feed, or processing (FFP) are exempt from the AIA procedure, and are
covered under Article 11 and Annex II of the Protocol. Under Article 11 Parties must post
decisions to the Biosafety Clearinghouse database on domestic use of LMOs for FFP that may be
subject to transboundary movement. To facilitate compliance with obligations to this protocol,
the U.S. Government has developed a website that provides the status of all regulatory reviews
completed for different uses of bioengineered products (NBII 2008). These data will be
available to the Biosafety Clearinghouse. APHIS continues to work toward harmonization of
