amylase corn a rodent might consume daily (page 94 of petition). Other mammals, such as deer,
would have even lower exposure to AMY797E because of feeding habits; for example, deer
nibble on tips of corn ears as opposed to kernels (Steffey et al. 1999). APHIS has reviewed this
information and has determined that there would be no negative effects to mammals that forage
in Event 3272 corn.
The applicant also evaluated the effects of AMY797E on birds by feeding broiler chickens diets
that contained up to 65% of Event 3272 grain for 49 days (page 94 of petition and page 6 of
response letter). The applicant reported no harmful effects to chickens from a diet extremely
high in AMY797E. Moreover, given that diets high in AMY797E do not result in harmful
effects, the diets of wild birds that occasionally forage in corn fields are unlikely to contain high
amounts of AMY797E for 49 consecutive days as corn availability is limited by seed
germination and harvest. APHIS has reviewed this information and has determined that there
would be no negative effects to birds that forage in Event 3272 corn.
Additionally, animals have been previously exposed to alpha-amylases in the environment, as
they are ubiquitous enzymes found in microorganisms, plants, and animals (Janeček et al. 1999).
AMY797E also does not have any significant sequence identity to any known toxins (page 7 of
response letter). As stated earlier, AMY797E is functionally similar to thermostable alpha-
amylases already safely used in food and feed processing (Janeček et al. 1999, Lévêque et al.
2000, Pariza and Johnson 2001, Olempska-Beer et al. 2006), indicating that Event 3272 corn is
unlikely to produce toxins that would negatively effect animals that may eat corn kernels or
plants containing AMY797E.
Organisms exposed to the AMY797E protein in Event 3272 corn will also be exposed to PMI, a
protein used by the applicant to select genetically engineered plants during breeding. Additional
species, such as leaf-feeding animals, butterflies and bees, may not be exposed to AMY797E but
will be exposed to PMI because of its expression in vegetative tissue and pollen (Table 3-4 of
petition). The pmi (manA) gene comes from E. coli and encodes the enzyme phosphomannose
isomerase (PMI). Pmi serves as a marker gene that enables selection of lines that are genetically
engineered, providing the plant with the ability to utilize mannose as a sole carbon source. Table
3-4 of the petition gives the PMI expression data for Event 3272 corn. PMI expression was
examined during 5 developmental stages of Event 3272 corn (whorl, anthesis, kernel dough,
kernel maturity, and senescence). In Event 3272 corn, PMI is expressed in leaves during all
stages except senescence, with maximum expression during the kernel dough stage (5.7 µg/g
fresh weight). Expression of PMI in the roots occurs during all developmental stages with the
highest expression of 1.0 µg/g fresh weight during the whorl stage. The highest PMI expression
for kernels occurred during the kernel dough stage (0.8 µg/g fresh weight), and 8.5 µg/g fresh
weight of PMI was expressed in the pollen. The expression of PMI protein in corn plants is not
expected to have deleterious effects or significant impacts on non-target organisms or TES
organisms, based on the data provided in the petition. Dietary calculations to determine the daily
dietary dose of PMI (page 93 of petition) and data from the mouse and bird toxicity studies (page
94 of petition) indicate that PMI levels in Event 3272 corn do not cause harm in wildlife
populations, including threatened and endangered species.
Additionally, the EPA has granted an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for the PMI
protein as an inert ingredient in all plants (69 FR 26770-26775). The DNA encoding the PMI
protein is not toxic. At the 80-amino acid peptide level, the PMI protein shares no significant
