expected to have deleterious effects or significant impacts on TES organisms, based on the data
provided in the petition. Dietary calculations to determine the daily dietary dose of PMI (page
93 of petition) and data from the mouse and bird toxicity studies (page 94 of petition) indicate
that PMI levels in Event 3272 corn do not cause harm for threatened and endangered species.
Additionally, the EPA has granted an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for the PMI
protein as an inert ingredient in all plants (69 FR 26770-26775). The DNA encoding the PMI
protein is not toxic. At the 80-amino acid peptide level, the PMI protein shares no significant
homology with proteins known to be toxic or allergenic. Within one of the 80-amino acid
windows, there was one region of sequence homology of eight contiguous amino-acids between
PMI and a known allergen, α-parvalbumin from a Rana (frog) species. Further testing found no
cross-reactivity between PMI and the human serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA), indicating that the low degree of sequence identity between the PMI used in
Event 3272 corn and α-parvalbumin from Rana sp. is not biologically relevant.
Corn itself is not sexually compatible with any TES plant species; therefore there is no potential
for a direct effect of Event 3272 corn on TES plants. Indirect effects of Event 3272 corn on TES
plant species were also evaluated. As stated above, Event 3272 corn has no negative effect on
animals, including animals such as insects or bats, which may be pollinators for TES plants.
Thus there are no indirect effects of Event 3272 corn on TES plant species.
Cultivation of Event 3272 corn is not expected to differ from typical corn cultivation. Event 3272
corn is not genetically engineered to produce a toxin or pesticide, and is not genetically
engineered to be tolerant to a herbicide. Although the extent to which Event 3272 corn will be
grown is ultimately unknown, this product is expected to replace other GE and non-GE corn
varieties currently grown for the ethanol market. After reviewing the possible effects of granting
nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn, APHIS has not identified any stressor caused directly by
this product that could affect the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of a listed TES or species
proposed for listing. The potential environmental impacts on TES of this product are those
associated with typical corn agriculture. Growers planting Event 3272 corn, as with any other
corn variety, genetically engineered or not, should consider the environmental impacts of
agronomic practices on those TES found in and around their corn field.
After reviewing possible effects of granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn, APHIS has
not identified any stressor that could affect the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of a listed
TES or species proposed for listing. Consequently, an exposure analysis for individual species is
not necessary. APHIS has considered the effect of Event 3272 corn production on designated
critical habitat or habitat proposed for designation and could identify no difference from affects
that would occur from the production of other corn varieties. APHIS has reached a conclusion
that the release of Event 3272 corn, following a determination of nonregulated status, would
have no effect on federally listed threatened or endangered species or species proposed for
listing, nor is it expected to adversely modify designated critical habitat or habitat proposed for
designation, compared to current agricultural practices. Consequently, a written concurrence or
formal consultation with the USFWS is not required for this action. Based on this analysis, there
is no apparent potential for significant impact on threatened or endangered species if APHIS
were to grant the petition for nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn.
