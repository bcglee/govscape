Syngenta reports that AMY797E alpha-amylase expression levels were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in several tissues at various stages of
development. Syngenta notes that expression of AMY797E is directed primarily to the kernel
by the maize gamma-zein promoter, and as expected, the highest concentration of AMY797E
alpha-amylase is in the kernel. Mean concentration measured in mature or senescent kernels
ranged from 838 ± 268 μg/g fresh weight (fw) (1004 ± 322 μg/g dry weight (dw)) to 955 ±
225 μg/g fw (1335 ± 358 μg/g dw). Mean concentration in younger "dough" stage (R4)
kernels ranged from 874 ± 160 μg/g fw (1994 ± 228 μg/g dw) to 1627 ± 338 μg/g fw (3365 ±
780 μg/g dw). Concentration of AMY797E alpha-amylase varied in whole plant samples, at
various growth stages, from < 12 μg/g fw (< 37 μg/g dw) to 281 ± 108 μg/g fw (668 ± 248
μg/g dw).
4.2.2 PMI
PMI protein concentrations were also measured in various tissues and developmental stages.
PMI was detected in most tissues tested and concentrations were similar regardless of the
developmental stage tested. The highest levels were detected in pollen, with concentrations
ranging from 8.0 to 8.5 μg/g fw (17.0 - 18.2 μg/g dw). Mean concentrations of PMI in
kernels over all growth stages ranged from < 0.4 μg/g fw (< 0.5 μg/g dw) to 0.8 ± 0.1 μg/g
fw (1.8 ± 0.4 μg/g dw). Concentrations of PMI in whole plant samples from all
developmental stages ranged from < 0.3 μg/g fw (< 0.6 μg/dw) to 1.5 ± 0.3 μg/g fw (3.6 ±
0.9 μg/g dw).
4.3. Assessment of Potential Allergenicity
Syngenta states that the potential allergenicity of the AMY797E alpha-amylase and PMI
proteins were assessed by searching for amino acid homology between these proteins and
known allergen protein sequences. These searches were conducted using a database
comprised of identified or putative allergen sequences from publicly available databases
(GenPept, PIR, SWISS-PROT, FAARP and IUIS) and additional putative allergen sequences
from the scientific literature. Syngenta also assessed the stability of the AMY797E and PMI
proteins using in vitro digestibility assays.
4.3.1 AMY797E Alpha-Amylase
Syngenta reports that the donor organisms (Thermococcus/Pyrococcus) used to
develop AMY797E alpha-amylase protein are not known to be allergenic.
Syngenta reports that for AMY797E, there were no amino acid sequence identities of
greater than 35% in segments of 80 amino acids with any entries in the database. Syngenta
does note that there was a single segment of 8 contiguous amino acids in AMY797E that
matched a known allergenic sequence derived from an insect. However, Syngenta notes
that the allergenic epitopes are known for this allergen (American cockroach, Per a 3) and
there is no overlap between these binding epitopes and the eight amino acid region of
sequence identity with AMY797E alpha-amylase. Therefore, Syngenta maintains that this
sequence identity is not biologically relevant and has no implication for the allergenic
