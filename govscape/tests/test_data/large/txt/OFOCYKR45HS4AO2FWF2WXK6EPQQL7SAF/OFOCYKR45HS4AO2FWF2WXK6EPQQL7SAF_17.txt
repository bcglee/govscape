The soil environment in and around corn fields is complex, rich in microorganisms and
arthropods. The corn root system acts as a soil modifier due to its association with several
microbial groups such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and mites. Bacteria typically represent the
most abundant microbes in the soil followed by fungi. These microbial groups play an important
and particular role in the ecology of the soil, including nutrimental cycling and the availability of
nutrients for plant growth. In addition, certain microbial organisms may contribute to the
protection of the root system against soil pathogens (OECD 2003).
Research shows that crop soils are prone to degradation due to the disturbance and exposure of
the top surface layer by certain agronomic practices. Two environmental impacts of soil
degradation are the decline in water quality and the contribution to the greenhouse effect (Lal
and Bruce 1999). It has been shown that a decline in soil quality and soil resilience6 enhances the
greenhouse effect through emissions of radiatively-active gases7 (CO , N O) and depletion of the
2 2
soil carbon pool (Lal 2003, US-EPA 2008) . In turn, a decrease in carbon aggregation and
sequestration in the soil leads to increase runoff and soil erosion.
CONSERVATION ACREAGE
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is America's largest and most effective private-lands
conservation program, with more than 36 million acres enrolled. Under CRP, farmers and
ranchers plant grasses and trees in crop fields and along streams. The plantings stop soil and
nutrients from washing into regional waterways and provide habitat for wildlife (USDA-FSA
2007).
CRP had 36.8 million enrolled acres as of 2007 (USDA-FSA 2007), and enrollment is limited to
39.2 million acres. CRP participants are required by the program to re-enroll or extend their
contracts, most of which are set to expire between 2007 and 2010. With the increased demand
for cropland due to market demands for agricultural crops over the last few years, CRP
enrollment acreage is expected to decrease. For example, of 15.7 million acres of CRP contracts
that expired in 2007, only 85% were re-enrolled or extended, resulting in 2.3 million acres of
cropland removed from the CRP program (USDA-FSA 2007). An estimated 4.9 million acres in
CRP contracts will exit CRP between 2007 and 2010 (USDA-FSA 2007). Of the 4.9 million
acres, approximately 1.4 million acres are located in major corn producing states. The change
from conservation program land to agricultural systems may alter the biodiversity on these acres.
ANIMAL FEED: DISTILLERS GRAINS WITH SOLUBLES
A bushel of corn going into an ethanol plant yields about 2.7 gallons of ethanol and 16-18
pounds of DDGS. As a result of increased ethanol production, the quantity of distillers grains
marketed for use in animal feed has increased from 1.89 million metric tons in 1999 to 8.35
million metric tons in 2005 (a 340 percent increase), and is expected to continue to increase in
the future. As biofuel production grows to the 7.5 billion gallons mandated in the Energy Policy
Act of 2005, DDGS production is expected to grow to more than 15 million tons (EIA 2007).
Approximately 90% of the distillers grains produced in U.S. facilities are used in domestic
animal feed. In North America, over 80% of DDGS are used in ruminant diets, but DDGS are
also used for hog, swine, broiler, and turkey feed. Currently, ethanol plants do not discriminate
