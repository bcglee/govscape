Dilution of Corn in Masa Supply Chain
To estimate the dilution effect of Corn amylase (CA) corn in non-CA (NCA) corn that could
potentially reach a masa production facility, Syngenta conducted interviews with grain
merchandisers to understand the movement of corn and the commingling with other corn that
occurs during transport and storage. This information was further supplemented with
Syngenta internal analysis of grain dilution patterns.
Masa facilities typically source their grains from within 50 miles of the plant (C. Morley,
Global Risk Management, Eden Prairie, MN,). White corn comprises approximately 80% of
the grain used for masa and is typically contracted because it is higher in density, protein and
oil and lower in moisture, thins and starch basis in comparison to yellow corn (Sparks 2003;
U.S. Grains Council 2007). Yellow corn may also be contracted and is used for color and
texture (Sparks 2003). While both white and yellow corn varieties are often contracted (up
to 80%; C. Morley), if bought on the open market , the grain would either be obtained
directly from a grower, local elevator or other local third party supplier. These same
distribution channels would also apply to CA grain that is mistakenly delivered to a masa
plant. Considering these likely distribution paths, Syngenta analyzed the grain dilution that
occurs for each.
The first case assumes a CA grower delivers a truck load of CA grain directly from a
production field or on-farm silo to a masa plant. In this case the truck contains only CA corn
was and is unloaded into a holding bin of non-CA corn at the plant. Drawing corn through a
bin will commingle the grain 3x to 16x depending on bin size and fullness at the time of
delivery (Syngenta unpubl. data). To be conservative, Syngenta estimates a dilution rate of
5x for direct delivery. If, however, the grain first went to a local elevator and then later
delivered to a masa facility it would have be drawn through two bins and one truck before
being used by the facility. This dilution factor is estimated at approximately 50x, i.e.,
approximately 10x at the local elevator (larger bins) and 5x at the masa storage bin (10x time
5x = 50x).
It is important to note that there is no food safety issue associated with the possible presence
of the alpha-amylase enzyme in foods as demonstrated by Syngentaâ€™s concluded consultation
with the FDA (BNF 0095). Furthermore, the likelihood of grain being mistakenly delivered
directly to a masa plant by a grower from their farm is very remote. Growers will be
contracted and paid a premium for producing CA grain and consequently, will have both
contractual and financial incentives to deliver this grain to the ethanol plant. In addition, a
large percentage of both white and yellow grain (up to 80%) is contracted and yellow
represents just 20% of the total used to produce masa. Nonetheless, if a masa plant or other
