Compliance with Statutes, Executive Orders and Regulations
Executive Order (EO) 12898 (US-NARA 2008), “Federal Actions to Address Environmental
Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations”, requires Federal agencies to
conduct their programs, policies, and activities that substantially affect human health or the
environment in a manner so as not to exclude persons and populations from participation in or
benefiting from such programs. It also enforces existing statutes to prevent minority or low-
income communities from being subjected to disproportionately high and adverse human health
or environmental effects. EO 13045 (US-NARA 2008), “Protection of Children from
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks”, acknowledges that children may suffer
disproportionately from environmental health and safety risks because of their developmental
stage, greater metabolic activity levels, and behavior patterns, as compared to adults. The EO (to
the extent permitted by law and consistent with the agency’s mission) required each Federal
agency to identify, assess, and address environmental health risks and safety risks that may
disproportionately affect children. Each alternative was analyzed with respect to EO 12898 and
13045. Based on the information submitted by the applicant and assessed by APHIS, Event 3272
corn is not significantly different than conventional corn and has successfully completed FDA
consultation for food and feed use. Therefore, Event 3272 corn is not expected to have a
disproportionate adverse effect on minorities, low-income populations, or children.
EO 13112 (US-NARA 2008), “Invasive Species”, states that Federal agencies take action to
prevent the introduction of invasive species, to provide for their control, and to minimize the
economic, ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause. Both non-GE and
GE corn varieties that have been granted nonregulated status are widely grown in the U.S. Based
on historical experience with corn and the data submitted by the applicant and assessed by
APHIS, Event 3272 corn plants are very similar in fitness characteristics to other corn varieties
currently grown and are not expected to become weedy or invasive [see (USDA-APHIS 2008)
for the plant pest risk assessment of Event 3272 corn].
EO 13186 (US-NARA 2008), “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds”,
states that Federal agencies taking actions that have, or are likely to have, a measurable negative
effect on migratory bird populations are directed to develop and implement, within 2 years, a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Fish and Wildlife Service that shall promote
the conservation of migratory bird populations. Data submitted by the applicant has shown no
difference in compositional and nutritional quality of Event 3272 corn compared to conventional
corn, apart from the presence of AMY797E and PMI. Syngenta also conducted feeding
experiments on broiler chickens to evaluate the effects of AMY797E on birds (page 94 of
petition and page 6 of response letter). The applicant reported no harmful effects to chickens
from a diet extremely high in AMY797E. Moreover, given that diets high in AMY797E do not
result in harmful effects, the diets of migratory birds that occasionally forage in corn fields are
unlikely to contain high amounts of AMY797E as corn availability is limited by seed
germination and harvest. Based on APHIS’ assessment of Event 3272 corn it is unlikely that
granting nonregulated status to this corn variety will have a negative effect on migratory bird
populations.
