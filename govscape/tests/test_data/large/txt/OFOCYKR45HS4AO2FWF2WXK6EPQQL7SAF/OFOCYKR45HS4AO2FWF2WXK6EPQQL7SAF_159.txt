Syngenta Biotechnology Inc. has developed a novel transgenic corn variety, designated as
Event 3272 that contains a genetically inserted thermostable alpha-amylase enzyme. Event
3272 is agronomically equivalent to No. 2 Yellow Corn and has been shown to be as safe for
human and animal consumption as conventional yellow corn; its unique properties make it
especially suited for use as a feedstock for ethanol produced by the dry grind process.
Dry Grind Ethanol Production
Ethanol is produced from corn and other grains using one of two production processes: wet
milling and dry milling. The main difference between the two is the initial treatment of the
grain. Most new ethanol facilities built in the U.S. in recent years have been dry grind plants.
According to the Renewable Fuels Association dry mill facilities account for 82 percent of
ethanol production and wet mills 18 percent.
In the typical dry grind process, the entire corn kernel is ground into a meal or flour and is
processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. Water is added to
form a mash to which enzymes are added to convert the starch to dextrose, a simple sugar.
Ammonia is added for pH control and as a nutrient for the yeast. The mash is processed in a
high-temperature cooker to reduce bacteria levels ahead of fermentation. The mash is cooled
and transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol and
carbon dioxide (CO ) begins.
