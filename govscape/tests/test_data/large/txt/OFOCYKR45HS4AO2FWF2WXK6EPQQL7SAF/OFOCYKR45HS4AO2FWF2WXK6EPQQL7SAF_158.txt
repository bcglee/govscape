Syngenta reported fat levels below the 0.1% limit of quantification in forage from both
event 3272-derived hybrids and their respective near-isogenic control lines at a single field
site. Excluding data from this site, reported mean values for fat were within published
literature ranges.
(4)
Values were within the ranges found in the International Life Sciences Institute Crop
Composition Database (version 3.0, released April 10, 2006, available at:
www.cropcomposition.org). Excluding phosphorous, means for all analytes also fell within
values cited by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
"Consensus Document on Compositional Considerations for New Varieties of Maize (Zea
Mays): Key Food and Feed Nutrients, Anti-Nutrients and Secondary Plant Metabolites."
(Series on the Safety of Novel Foods and Feeds, No. 6, 2002).

Syngenta limited forage analytes in the combined statistical analysis to those suggested by
the OECD (2002). Fat was excluded from the combined statistical analysis due to levels
below the limit of detection.
(6)
The following 9 grain analytes had one or more observations below the limit of quantitation
of the assay: sodium, selenium, raffinose, phytic acid, furfural, tocopherols (α-, β- and γ-),
and vitamin C. An observation represents the mean of 3 replicate plots per location, with
grain from 15 plants pooled from each plot.
(7)
Values were within the ranges found in the International Life Sciences Institute
Crop Composition Database (version 3.0, released April 10, 2006, available at:
www.cropcomposition.org). Fatty acids mean values were within ranges cited by
OECD (2002).

For several of the analytes, Syngenta reported that the treatment (genotype) effect differed
by location. However, based on the statistical model used, the interpretation of the data was
not affected.

Syngenta notes that the non-transgenic control grain appeared to contain
low levels
(approximately 1.6-2.6%) of event-3272 corn.
