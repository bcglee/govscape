No Action: Biological Diversity
Under the “no action” alternative, environmental releases of Event 3272 corn would be under
regulation. Animal and plant species that typically inhabit corn production systems will be
managed as in conventional corn production, likely with the use of mechanical, cultural, and
chemical control methods.
Preferred Alternative: Biological Diversity
Under the “preferred” alternative, environmental releases of Event 3272 corn not require
authorization by APHIS. Cultivation of Event 3272 corn requires the same agronomic practices
as conventional corn production. Animal and plant species that typically inhabit corn production
systems will be managed as in conventional corn production, likely with the use of mechanical,
cultural, and chemical control methods.
Cumulative Effects: Animals, Plants, Biodiversity
Event 3272 corn is a new GE corn variety that would be allowed for environmental release
without the need for a permit or notification, if granted nonregulated status under the “preferred”
alternative. Event 3272 corn has not been genetically engineered to produce a toxin orpesticide,
and has not been genetically engineered to be tolerant to an herbicide. Although some studies
have found both increases and decreases in animal and plant diversity and abundance in the agro-
ecosystem due to the use of GE crops (Hansen Jesse and Obrycki 2000, Ponsard et al. 2002,
Brooks et al. 2003, Haughton et al. 2003, Hawes et al. 2003, Marshall et al. 2003, Roy et al.
2003, Romeis et al. 2004, Sisterson et al. 2004, Bitzer et al. 2005, Pilcher et al. 2005, Torres and
Ruberson 2005, Romeis et al. 2006, Marvier et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008, Wolfenbarger et al.
2008), Event 3272 corn is unlikely to affect the animal or plant communities found in
conventional corn production systems because of the lack of toxicity and allergencity, and
because there is no change to agronomic practices due to the cultivation of Event 3272 corn.
Soil Biology
The soil environment in and around corn fields is complex, rich in microorganisms and
arthropods. The corn root system acts as a soil modifier due to its association with several
microbial groups such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and mites. Bacteria typically represent the
most abundant microbes in the soil followed by fungi. These microbial groups play an important
and particular role in the ecology of the soil, including nutrimental cycling and the availability of
nutrients for plant growth.
Research shows that crop soils are prone to degradation due to the disturbance and exposure of
the top surface layer by certain agronomic practices. Two environmental impacts of soil
degradation are the decline in water quality and the contribution to the greenhouse effect (Lal
and Bruce 1999).
No Action: Soil Biology
Under the “no action” alternative, environmental releases of Event 3272 corn would be under
regulation. Interactions with the soil would be limited to the areas that were approved for
regulated releases. Cultivation practices associated with regulated releases of Event 3272 corn
would be the same as conventional corn production. The soil environment would be modified by
