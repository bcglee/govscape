• license the use of Event 3272 corn product to growers;
• sell Event 3272 corn hybrids only to licensed growers with a valid contract
with an ethanol plant or approved third party grain company that supplies corn
amylase to the ethanol plant;
● ensure that grain contract includes stewardship agreement;
• provide incentive to grower for producing and delivery of Event 3272 corn
product;
• provide stewardship guide to producers and handlers on the cultivation and
handling of the Event 3272 corn product;
• provide specific procedures for the handling of any excess grain;
• ensure the domestic consumption of DDGS prior to export market approvals;
• make available appropriate detection methods; and,
• develop and implement a communication program.
Grower (stewardship roles and responsibilities):
• execute delivery contract with ethanol plant;
• execute stewardship contract with Syngenta;
• follow Syngenta stewardship guide on cultivation; and,
• follow Syngenta requirement to divert excess grain to appropriate use.
Ethanol Plant (stewardship roles and responsibilities):
• contract with growers to supply Event 3272 corn product; and,
• ensure domestic consumption of DDGS prior to export market approvals;
These stewardship roles and responsibilities in concert with the contract relationships
between the entities in the closed-loop system and the backstop mechanisms minimize the
risk of inadvertent delivery of Event 3272 corn and commingling.
