Minimization of Pollen-Mediated Gene Flow from Corn Amylase Corn through
Planting Border Rows
Over the past several years a number of studies have been published on the distribution of
corn pollen and the potential transgenes to fertilize other corn. The USDA APHIS BRS
reviewed this topic in their Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on the
Introduction of Genetically Engineered Organisms (USDA 2007). Syngenta’s analysis of
pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) from corn amylase corn (CA) to non-corn amylase corn
(NCA) is built upon several published studies, i.e., Jarosz et al. (2003), Jemison and Veyda
(2001), Ma (2005), Ma et al. (2004) and Westgate et al. (2003). However, emphasis was
placed upon the work of Dr. Ma, Eastern Cereal and Oilseed Research Center, Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada (http://www.isb.vt.edu/articles/feb0502.htm ). Dr. Ma’s findings
were consistent with or more conservative than the other studies, i.e., the potential for pollen
movement over a longer distance and a greater probability for PMGF at the same distance.
Furthermore, Dr. Ma’s exponential decline model indicates essentially a zero probability of
detecting PMGF beyond six hundred and sixty-six feet (200 meters) (Table 1).
Using Dr. Ma’s model, Syngenta calculated the probability of PMGF from a 75-acre field of
100% CA corn to NCA corn planted on all four sides. The analysis was performed with and
without 12 NCA corn border rows surrounding the CA field. The NCA corn was planted
th
immediately adjacent to the CA corn (Scenario 1, Figure 1) or the 12 border row (Scenario
2, Figure 2). As previously communicated to APHIS BRS on September 6, 2007, Syngenta,
post-commercialization, will instruct growers to plant 12 border rows around each CA field.
The following assumptions were made in calculating PMGF in these two scenarios:
1. CA corn pollen will flow to the NCA corn bordering all four sides and corners of
the CA field.
th
2. The probability of CA corn PMGF beyond the edge of the CA field or 12 border
to 200 meters in the NCA corn fields was calculated using Dr. Ma’s exponential
decline model (Ma 2005).
3. 100% of the corn in the CA field contains the corn amylase trait.
Based on these assumptions, and the Ma exponential decline model, under Scenario 1,
Syngenta calculates that 0.19% of the NCA corn planted adjacent to the CA corn to 200
meters will contain the CA gene (Table 1, Row 1). Under Scenario 2, 0.005% of the NCA
th
corn planted adjacent to the 12 border row to 200 meters will contain the CA gene (Table 1,
Row 12). Consequently, the 12 border rows surrounding the CA corn field capture 97.2% of
all CA pollen (0.190% - 0.005%) / (0.190%) = 97.2%.
