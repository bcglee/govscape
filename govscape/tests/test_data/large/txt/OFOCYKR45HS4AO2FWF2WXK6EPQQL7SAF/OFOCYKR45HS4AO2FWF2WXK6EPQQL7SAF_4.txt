I. Purpose & Need
REGULATORY AUTHORITY
"Protecting American agriculture" is the basic charge of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
(USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). APHIS provides leadership in
ensuring the health and care of plants and animals. The agency improves agricultural
productivity and competitiveness, and contributes to the national economy and the public health.
USDA asserts that all methods of agricultural production (conventional, organic, or the use of
genetically engineered varieties) can provide benefits to the environment, consumers, and farm
income.
In 1986, the Federal Government’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published a
policy document known as the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology.
This document specifies three Federal agencies that are responsible for regulating biotechnology
in the U.S.: USDA’s APHIS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). APHIS regulates
genetically engineered (GE) organisms under the Plant Protection Act of 2000. FDA regulates
under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA policy statement
concerning regulation of products derived from new plant varieties, including those genetically
engineered, was published in the Federal Register on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22984-23005).
Under this policy, FDA uses what is termed a consultation process to ensure that human food
and animal feed safety issues or other regulatory issues (e.g., labeling) are resolved prior to
commercial distribution of bioengineered food. Products are regulated according to their
intended use and some products are regulated by more than one agency. The EPA regulates
plant-incorporated protectants under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA) and certain biological control organisms under the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA). Together, these agencies ensure that the products of modern biotechnology are safe to
grow, safe to eat, and safe for the environment. USDA, EPA, and FDA enforce agency-specific
regulations to products of biotechnology that are based on the specific nature of each GE
organism.
WHAT IS A REGULATED ORGANISM?
The APHIS Biotechnology Research Service’s (BRS) mission is to protect America’s agriculture
and environment using a dynamic and science-based regulatory framework that allows for the
safe development and use of genetically engineered organisms. APHIS regulations at 7 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) part 340, which were promulgated pursuant to authority granted by
the Plant Protection Act, as amended (7 United States Code (U.S.C.) 7701–7772), regulate the
introduction (importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of certain
genetically engineered (GE) organisms and products. An organism is no longer subject to the
regulatory requirements of 7 CFR part 340 when APHIS determines that it is unlikely to pose a
plant pest risk. A GE organism is considered a regulated article if the donor organism, recipient
organism, vector, or vector agent used in engineering the organism belongs to one of the taxa
listed in the regulation (7 CFR § 340.2) and is also considered a plant pest.
A person may petition the agency to evaluate submitted data and determine that a particular
regulated article is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk, and, therefore, should no longer be
regulated under 7 CFR § 340.6 “Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status.” The
petitioner is required to provide information (§ 340.6(c)(4)) related to plant pest risk that the
