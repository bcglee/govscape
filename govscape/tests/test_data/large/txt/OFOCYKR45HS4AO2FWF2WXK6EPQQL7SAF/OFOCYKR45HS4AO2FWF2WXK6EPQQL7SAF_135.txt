B. Utilization of Event 3272 Corn
Notwithstanding its safety as food, Event 3272 will be commercialized for the value it
brings to ethanol production. In order to capture the highest value of Event 3272 corn, it will be
branded, marketed, and sold for that use â€“ i.e., with an indication of its unique characteristic
relating to the expression of an alpha-amylase. This commercial approach is comparable to the
marketing of many other specialty corns.
It is expected that Event 3272 corn may be unsuitable for some processing
applications for which it will not be branded, marketed or sold. Specialty corns, such as
waxy corn, are developed for a specific purpose and generally are unsuitable for use in other
applications. The AMY797E alpha-amylase enzyme in Event 3272 corn is not able to act on
the starch in the intact kernel and neither the starch itself nor any other nutritional or
functional component of Event 3272 corn has been altered by the genetic modification.61
However, during or after processing, enzyme activity could result in the conversion of some
starch to dextrins and sugars. It is this potential for alpha-amylase starch hydrolyzing
activity, during or after processing, that may make it unsuitable for some applications. For
example, Event 3272 could have an effect in alkaline cooking, the process used to produce
masa. Masa flour and dough are used to make tortillas and chips. The effect decreases the
handling characteristics of the masa dough and the acceptability of the appearance of the
finished product produced from that dough.62
The strict grain sourcing procedures in the masa industry make it highly
unlikely that Event 3272 corn would be diverted to a masa facility. The masa
industry has developed quality control measures to meet production requirements,
61 As presented in the Syngenta Petition for deregulation of Event 3272 corn, compositional analysis
demonstrated it is not materially different from commercial corn hybrids. This is in contrast to the specialty
corns in which the starch, oil, protein, or color content itself is intentionally modified. See Syngenta Petition for
