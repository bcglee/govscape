• license the use of Event 3272 corn product to growers;
• sell Event 3272 corn hybrids only to licensed growers with a valid contract with
an ethanol plant or approved third party grain company that supplies corn amylase
to the ethanol plant;
● ensure that grain contract includes stewardship agreement;
• provide incentive to grower for producing and delivery of Event 3272 corn
product;
• provide stewardship guide to producers and handlers on the cultivation and
handling of the Event 3272 corn product;
• provide specific procedures for the handling of any excess grain;
• ensure the domestic consumption of DDGS prior to export market approvals;
• make available appropriate detection methods; and,
• develop and implement a communication program.
Grower (stewardship roles and responsibilities):
• execute delivery contract with ethanol plant;
• execute stewardship contract with Syngenta;
• follow Syngenta stewardship guide on cultivation; and,
• follow Syngenta requirement to divert excess grain to appropriate use.
Ethanol Plant (stewardship roles and responsibilities):
• contract with growers to supply Event 3272 corn product; and,
• ensure domestic consumption of DDGS prior to export market approvals;
These stewardship roles and responsibilities in concert with the contract relationships
between the entities in the closed-loop system and the backstop mechanisms minimize
the risk of inadvertent delivery of Event 3272 corn and commingling. ”
According to Syngenta (see Appendix G), the system for Event 3272 corn will include contracts
for Event 3272 corn grown only within the geographic footprint of an ethanol plant. The ethanol
plant will contract with growers for Event 3272 corn either directly with growers in their
geographic region or indirectly through grain suppliers. The contracts for growers will dictate
the delivery location (ethanol plant or storage site) within a specified radius of the field, a
delivery date, and amount to be delivered. Syngenta has stated that hybrids with Event 3272 will
only be available to growers with a valid contract, and who agree to the Syngenta Stewardship
Agreement (see Appendix G).
Part of the Stewardship Agreement is the requirement that growers include 12 rows of non-Event
3272 corn as a pollen trap to reduce the amount of Event 3272 pollen that may leave the corn
field. Syngenta has provided an analysis (Appendix D) that analyzes the effect of using border
rows on the minimizing corn pollen leaving an Event 3272 corn field. Syngenta’s analysis
suggests that more than 99.9% of all corn pollen is captured when 12 border rows of non-Event
3272 corn plants are used and flowers are in synchrony with the Event 3272 corn field.
