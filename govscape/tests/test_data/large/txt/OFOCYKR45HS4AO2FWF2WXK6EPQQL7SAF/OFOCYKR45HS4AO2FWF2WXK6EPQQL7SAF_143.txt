non-target users. There are three scenarios under which the dedicated grain supply system
between the seed supplier, the contracted grower and the ethanol plant for Event 3272 could
be breached, creating the possibility for Event 3272 to enter the yellow corn commodity
market. First, adventitious pollination could result in Event 3272 growing in neighboring
fields. Second, a contracted grower could inadvertently deliver Event 3272 corn directly to a
masa production facility. Third, the contracted grower could inadvertently deliver Event
3272 to a local elevator that is an open-market supplier to a masa production facility.
As discussed above, the probability of the first scenario is remote. First, less than
10% of corn fields supporting ethanol plants (the geographic area in which Event 3272 will
be grown) are in the vicinity of masa plants. The twelve border row requirement for harvest
assures that 99.9% of the grown corn amylase will be accounted for in the Event 3272
dedicated grain supply system. This level, even before the certain dilution with other yellow-
dent corn bound for the masa facility, is below the level which would impact masa
production.
The likelihood of the second and third scenarios is effectively reduced by the series of
supply-chain control points between the field and the masa facility. These control points
include those in the masa industry and those in the closed-loop system for Event 3272 corn.
The controls in the masa industry make it highly unlikely that Event 3272 corn would be
diverted to a masa facility. Even if a diversion occurs, testing and dilution rates further
minimize the risk. The controls in the closed-loop system build stewardship responsibilities
for the farm, the transporters, and the ethanol plants that substantially reduce this risk even
more. Whatever risk there is even further reduced by the mechanisms, standards, and
recordkeeping requirements in the modern grain system that promote product segregation
and identity preservation.
It is important to note that the context and intensity effects as analyzed in this hard-
look analysis do not differ from those associated with other specialty corns in commerce
today. Many of these specialty corn products are unsuitable for some generic corn uses. For
example, waxy corn starch has a unique starch matrix of more than 98% amylopectin starch.
It delivers a unique functionality that differs from normal yellow dent corn starch, which is a
blend of 70% amylopectin and 30% amylose. Should waxy corn be introduced into a wet
mill that produces starch products from standard yellow dent corn, the products will not meet
commercial specifications.
Based on the hard-look analysis of the context of introduction of Event 3272 as a
specialty grain and the intensity of its impact, the effect is not significant. The Syngenta
Stewardship Program, the sophisticated ability of the U.S. grain supply system to manage
and distribute differentiated specialty corn grain, and the traceability record-keeping
provisions of the Bioterrorism Act all support a determination that the deregulation of Event
3272 will not significantly affect the human environment.
