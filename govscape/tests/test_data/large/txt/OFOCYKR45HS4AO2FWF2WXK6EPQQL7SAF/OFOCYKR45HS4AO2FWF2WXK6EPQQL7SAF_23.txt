IV. Environmental Consequences
Potential environmental impacts from the “no action” alternative and the “preferred” alternative
for Event 3272 corn are described in detail throughout this section. A cumulative effects analysis
is also included for each environmental issue. Certain aspects of this product and its cultivation
would be no different between the alternatives; those are described below.
Methodology and Assumptions
The environmental effects analysis is greatly dependent on assumptions used for estimating
effects. The following are key underlying assumptions use to estimate effects for each
alternative.
SCOPE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
Although the preferred alternative would allow for new plantings of Event 3272 corn to occur
anywhere in the U.S., APHIS will limit the environmental analysis to those areas that currently
support corn production. To determine areas of corn production, APHIS used data from the
National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) 2002 Census of Agriculture to determine where
corn is produced in the United States (www.nass.usda.gov, accessed 6/5/2008). The 2002
Census data is the most current, publically accessible county-level data available. At the time of
developing these alternatives, the 2007 Census of Agriculture was not yet complete.
The list of 49 states that produce corn grain is found in Table 3, according to the 2002 Census of
Agriculture. As of July 2008, there are 161 operational ethanol plants, another 42 plants are
under construction, and 7 are under expansion (www.ethanolrfa.org). The states that have
operational ethanol plants or have plants that are under construction that use corn as the input are
also listed in Table 3.
Table 3. States that grow corn according to the 2002 Census of Agriculture, and whether the
state also has an active corn ethanol facility or one under construction. The states that grow corn
and have an existing corn ethanol facility or one under construction will be included in the
analysis for the environmental effects for Event 3272 corn.
