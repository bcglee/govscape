III. Alternatives
This EA analyzes the potential environmental consequences of a proposal to grant nonregulated
status to Event 3272 corn. In order for Event 3272 corn to be granted nonregulated status, it
must be found to be unlikely pose a plant pest risk. The analysis provided in the plant pest risk
assessment (USDA-APHIS 2008) demonstrates that there was sufficient data to determine that
Event 3272 corn is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk; thus APHIS has no regulatory authority
over Event 3272 corn and this GE corn variety is eligible for nonregulated status.
The regulations at 7 CFR 340.6(d)(3)(i) state that APHIS may "approve the petition in whole or
in part." Because APHIS has found that Event 3272 corn is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk, the
only action alternative considered in this EA is to granting nonregulated status “in whole” to
Event 3272 corn. Approval in part can be given if there is a plant pest risk associated with some
but not all lines requested in a petition. The petition for Event 3272 corn only requested APHIS
to grant nonregulated status to one corn line, so this type “in part” approval will not be
considered. Under another type of approval “in part,” the petition may be approved with
geographic restrictions if there is a geographic variation in plant pest risk. There are no
geographic differences in plant pest risks for Event 3272 corn (USDA-APHIS 2008). Thus,
there are two alternatives that will be considered in this EA: (1) no action and (2) to grant
nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn, “in whole.”
A. No Action: Continuation as a Regulated Article
Under the "no action" alternative, APHIS would not change the regulated status of Event 3272
corn under the regulations in 7 CFR part 340. The company would have to continue to request
permits and notifications for new introductions of Event 3272 corn plants. As such, it would be
difficult for the company to commercialize Event 3272 corn under the permit or notification
process. Thus, it would be unlikely that Event 3272 corn could effectively increase the
efficiency of ethanol production. This alternative is not the preferred alternative because APHIS
has already determined through a plant pest risk assessment (USDA-APHIS 2008) that Event
3272 corn is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk. Choosing this alternative would hinder the
purpose and need of APHIS to allow for the safe development and use of GE organisms given
that Event 3272 corn does not pose a plant pest risk.
B. Preferred Alternative: Determination that Event 3272 Corn Plants
are No Longer Regulated Articles, in Whole
Under this alternative, Event 3272 corn would no longer be a regulated article under the
regulations at 7 CFR part 340. Event 3272 corn is eligible for nonregulated status because
APHIS has determined that this GE organism is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk (USDA-APHIS
2008), thus APHIS has no regulatory authority over Event 3272 corn. Permits issued or
notifications acknowledged by APHIS would no longer be required for introductions of Event
3272 corn, or progeny derived from these events. By granting nonregulated status to Event 3272
corn, the purpose and need to allow the safe development and use of GE organisms is met.
C. Alternatives Considered but Rejected from Further Consideration
APHIS assembled a comprehensive list of alternatives that might be implemented in the decision
process for Event 3272 corn. The agency individually evaluated each alternative on the basis of
legality, environmental safety, efficacy, and practicality to identify which alternatives would be
