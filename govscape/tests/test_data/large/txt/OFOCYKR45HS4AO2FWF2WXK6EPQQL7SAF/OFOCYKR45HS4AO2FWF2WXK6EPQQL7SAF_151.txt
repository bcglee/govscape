Syngenta reports that corn event 3272 contains no detectable genetic material from the
pNOV7013 backbone, including the spec, virG, and repA genes.
Syngenta examined the stability and inheritance pattern of the introduced traits through
conventional breeding over five generations consisting of four rounds of backcrossing to
conventional inbred lines. Syngenta reported no significant differences in the observed-to-
expected segregation ratios for the amy797E gene over five generations, as demonstrated by
the
2
chi-square (Ï‡ ) values. Syngenta reported that these segregation data indicate a single-
locus, Mendelian inheritance pattern for the insert in corn event 3272.
4. Introduced Substances - AMY797E Alpha-Amylase and PMI Enzymes
Syngenta provided information on the identity, function, and characterization of the genes as
well the expression levels of the gene products. They also provided information on the
potential allergenicity and toxicity of the expressed proteins.
4.1 Identity, Function, and Characterization
4.1.1 AMY797E Alpha-Amylase
Syngenta compared the amino acid sequence of the AMY797E alpha-amylase protein to
other alpha-amylases, stating that AMY797E shared a 93% homology to a microbially
derived alpha-amylase BD5088 (Innovase LLC) produced through a similar recombination
technique as AMY797E. The BD5088 alpha-amylase was the subject of a generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) notice (GRN 126) for use in food. Syngenta also provided the
complete amino acid sequence of AMY797E. Additionally, Syngenta provided information
about the functional activity of AMY797E to demonstrate its functionality as an alpha-
amylase.
4.1.2 PMI
The pmi gene, introduced as a selectable marker into corn event 3272, encodes a
phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) enzyme that catalyzes the inter-conversion of
mannose-6phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. The expression of the pmi gene in the
plant allows the plant to survive and grow on media containing only mannose as the only
or primary carbon source, which facilitates selection of transformed plants.
Syngenta reports that PMI enzymes exist widely in nature among both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Syngenta states that PMI enzymes have been found in plants such as tobacco,
walnut, and soybean and other legumes, although Syngenta notes that sequence homology for
the pmi gene introduced into event 3272 is highest for enteric Gram-negative bacteria (70-
100% homology).
