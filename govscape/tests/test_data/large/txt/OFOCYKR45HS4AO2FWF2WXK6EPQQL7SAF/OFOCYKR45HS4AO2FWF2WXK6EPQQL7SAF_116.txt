1
Data presented in this table was calculated using the exponential decline model described in Ma (2005,
http://www.isb.vt.edu/articles/feb0502.htm ).
2
Number of rows from the edge of the Corn Amylase (CA) field into a field of non-CA corn.
3
The “Beyond Mean” refers to the percent of pollen mediated gene flow in non-CA corn from the distance indicated to 200
meters from the edge of the CA field.
