homology with proteins known to be toxic or allergenic. Within one of the 80-amino acid
windows, there was one region of sequence homology of eight contiguous amino-acids between
PMI and a known allergen, α-parvalbumin from a Rana (frog) species. Further testing found no
cross-reactivity between PMI and the human serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA), indicating that the low degree of sequence identity between the PMI used in
Event 3272 corn and α-parvalbumin from Rana sp. is not biologically relevant.
Plants
Corn production systems in agriculture are host many plant species as well. The landscape
surrounding a corn field varies depending on the region. In certain areas, corn fields may be
bordered by other corn (or any other crop); fields may also be surrounded by wooden and/or
pasture/grassland areas. Therefore, the types of vegetation, including weeds, around a corn field
depend on the area where the corn is planted. A variety of weeds dwell in and around corn fields;
those species will also vary depending on the region where the corn is planted. Corn itself is not
sexually compatible with any other plant species found in the U.S. (USDA-APHIS 2008). The
cumulative effects analysis for this issue is found below at “Cumulative Effects: Plants, Animals,
Biodiversity.”
No Action: Plants
Under the “no action” alternative, environmental releases of Event 3272 corn would be under
regulation. Plant species that typically inhabit corn production systems will be managed as in
conventional corn production, likely with the use of mechanical, cultural, and chemical control
methods.
Preferred Alternative: Plants
If Event 3272 corn was granted nonregulated status, agricultural practices used for conventional
corn would be used for plant management during the cultivation of Event 3272 corn. Event 3272
corn does not exhibit characteristics associated with weedy growth and will not compete with
plants found outside of agricultural production. Weeds within fields of Event 3272 corn will be
managed using mechanical, cultural, and chemical control, as weeds are now managed in
conventional corn systems. As there are no toxic effects on animals (see Animals discussion
above), there are no toxic effects on animals that could be pollinators of other plants in or around
fields cultivated with Event 3272 corn. Event 3272 corn has not been genetically engineered to
be tolerant to any herbicides.
Biological Diversity
Biological diversity, or the variation in species or life forms in an area, is highly managed in
agricultural systems. Farmers typically plant crops that are genetically adapted to grow well in a
specific area of cultivation and may have even been bred for a particular purpose. In the case of
corn agriculture, corn varieties have been developed for food processing needs (e.g., waxy corn),
varietal development (e.g., blue corn or white corn), or for use as a vegetable (e.g. sweet corn).
In conventional agriculture, farmers want to encourage high yields from their corn crop, and will
intensively manage the ‘plant communities’, or weeds, found in corn crops through chemical,
cultural or mechanical means. Animals, particularly insect and other pest species will also be
managed through chemical and cultural controls to protect the crop from destruction by animals.
Therefore, the biological diversity in agricultural systems (the agro-ecosystem) is highly
managed and may be lower than in the surrounding habitats. The cumulative effects analysis for
this issue is found below at “Cumulative Effects: Plants, Animals, Biodiversity.”
