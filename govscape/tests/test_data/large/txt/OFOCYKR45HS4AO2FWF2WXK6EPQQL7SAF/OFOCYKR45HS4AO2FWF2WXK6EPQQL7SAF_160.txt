After fermentation, the resulting mixture called “beer” is transferred to distillation columns
where the ethanol is separated out. The ethanol is concentrated to 190 proof using
conventional distillation and then is dehydrated to approximately 200 proof in a molecular
sieve system. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with a denaturant such as regular
gasoline to render it non potable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. It is then ready
for shipment to gasoline terminals for blending with gasoline.
After the fermented mash is distilled to remove the alcohol, the remaining slurry contains 5
to 10 percent dry matter called whole or spent stillage. Whole stillage is processed by
various techniques to remove the large volume of water associated with the residual dry
matter. The first step involves screening and pressing, or centrifuging to remove the solids
composed of coarser grain particles. These solids, called Distillers’ Grains - DG, can be
subsequently handled in several ways but are ultimately sold in various forms for animal
feed. The distillers grains can be sold as a wet product (Wet Distillers’ Grains – WDG) or
can be dried (Dried Distillers’ Grains – DDG). The liquid remaining after screening or
centrifuging the whole stillage contains fine grain particles and yeast cells and is called thin
stillage. Thin stillage is generally evaporated to produce a syrup called solubles which may
be added back to the distillers grains. The mixture is then dried to produce Dried Distillers
Grains with Solubles (DDGS), a high quality, medium-protein livestock feed.
Alpha-amylase is one of two enzymes (the other being glucoamylase) that convert the starch
in corn to sugar which is then fermented and distilled into ethanol. Microbial produced
alpha-amylase is already used commercially in the starch to sugar step of the dry grind and
wet mill process of ethanol production. The Syngenta innovation prompts corn to produce its
own heat-resistant alpha-amylase, thus eliminating the need for externally applied microbial
alpha-amylase.
