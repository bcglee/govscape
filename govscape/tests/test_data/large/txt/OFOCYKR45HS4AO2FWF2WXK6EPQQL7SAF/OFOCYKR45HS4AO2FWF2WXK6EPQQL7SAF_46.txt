acreage removed from the CRP program to meet the mandated amounts of ethanol production.
Thus, under the “preferred” alternative, Event 3272 corn would be available to growers, and
could be used as a potential method to keep more acres in CRP and still meet the mandated goals
for ethanol production. However, even if the use of Event 3272 corn did not result in a
measurable increase in ethanol efficiency during production, granting Event 3272 corn
nonregulated status would not result in the increase of acreage being removed from the CRP
program. Market demands and corn prices are the drivers behind decisions made by growers to
remove acres from CRP (Hart 2006).
Cumulative Effects: Conservation Reserve Program
The demands for ethanol production and increased corn prices are likely greater factors in
determining if a farmer would remove acres from the CRP and place them into corn production,
than granting Event 3272 nonregulated status. No cumulative effects identified for this issue.
Other Cumulative Effects
All potential cumulative effects regarding specific issues have been analyzed and addressed
above. No further potential cumulative effects have been identified. Stacked varieties, those
crop varieties that may contain more than one trait, are currently found in the marketplace and in
agricultural production. If granted nonregulated status, Event 3272 corn may be combined with
other GE corn varieties by traditional breeding techniques, resulting in amylase corn that, for
example, may also be resistant to herbicides or insects. Some GE corn varieties used for any
commercial breeding program have already been found not to pose a plant pest risk, and have
been granted nonregulated status by APHIS. APHIS does not have any regulatory authority over
these GE corn varieties previously granted nonregulated status, and has no regulatory jurisdiction
over stacked varieties combining deregulated GE varieties unless it could be positively shown
that such stacked varieties somehow posed a likely plant pest risk. Further, there is no guarantee
that Event 3272 corn will be stacked with any particular deregulated GE variety, as company
plans and market demands play a significant role in those business decisions. Moreover, Event
3272 corn could even be combined with non-GE corn varieties. Thus, postulating and predicting
any and all potential combinations of stacked varieties that could be created using both
deregulated GE corn varieties and also non-GE corn varieties is too hypothetical and purely
speculative.
