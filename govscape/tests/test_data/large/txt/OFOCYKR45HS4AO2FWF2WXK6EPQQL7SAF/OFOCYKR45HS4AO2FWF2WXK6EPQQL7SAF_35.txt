Ethanol processing of corn grain into ethanol involves the use of hazardous chemicals. In
standard ethanol production, pH is adjusted at several stages to maintain efficient processing
using sulfuric acid and liquid ammonia during different ethanol processing steps for pH
adjustment. Under the “no action” alternative, exposure to these ethanol processing chemicals
would remain the same.
Preferred Alternative: Worker Safety
Worker safety issues related to the use of pesticides during agricultural production of Event 3272
corn would remain the same as the “no action” alternative. As discussed under the issue of
“Pesticide Use”, Event 3272 corn does not change the agronomic practices, or use of chemicals
such as pesticides, associated with corn production.
The use of Event 3272 corn in ethanol production could result in changes in inputs and methods
during ethanol production. Each of the potential changes is due to the substitution of Event 3272
corn grain, containing a thermostable alpha-amylase, for microbial alpha-amylase in the
liquefaction stage of ethanol production. Appendix C contains a report submitted on behalf of
Syngenta, and reviewed by APHIS, that outlines these changes in detail. A brief summary of the
potential changes suggested to worker safety is provided below.
Using Event 3272 corn in the ethanol production process, instead of standard field corn with
microbial alpha-amylase added, may eliminate constant adjustment of pH during processing. In
standard ethanol production, pH is adjusted at several stages to maintain efficient processing.
With the use of Event 3272 corn, and the potential consistency in pH during ethanol production,
the use of sulfuric acid may be reduced by half because less sulfuric acid is needed to maintain
pH. Urea may also be used as a substitute for liquid ammonia for additional pH balancing,
because of the pH properties of ethanol processing due to the use of Event 3272 corn. Thus, the
possible replacement and reduction of these hazardous chemicals (sulfuric acid and liquid
ammonia) would reduce both environmental and workplace safety exposure.
Cumulative Effects: Worker Safety
Worker safety issues related to the use of pesticides during agricultural production of Event 3272
corn would remain the same as the “no action” alternative. As discussed under the issue of
“Pesticide Use”, Event 3272 corn does not change the agronomic practices, or use of chemicals
such as pesticides, associated with corn production. There are no cumulative effects identified
for this issue.
Animal Feed - DDGS
Distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) is a co-product of ethanol production, and is mainly used
domestically as feed for dairy cattle, but also for hogs, swines, broilers and turkeys. As a result
of increased ethanol production, the quantity of distillers grains marketed for use in animal feed
has increased from 1.89 million metric tons in 1999 to 8.35 million metric tons in 2005 (a 340
percent increase), and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As biofuel production
grows to the 7.5 billion gallons mandated in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DDGS production is
expected to grow to more than 15 million tons (EIA 2007).
Approximately 90% of the distillers grains produced in U.S. facilities are used in domestic
animal feed. Currently, ethanol plants do not discriminate between GE and non-GE corn. Given
