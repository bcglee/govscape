alpha-amylase would not be needed in ethanol production due to the replacement by the alpha-
amylase in Event 3272 corn.
Cumulative Effect: Water Use in Ethanol Production
Ethanol production typically uses 4.7 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of ethanol (Shapouri
and Gallagher 2005). Water is also used during the manufacturing and transport of microbial
alpha-amylase for conventional ethanol production. Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272
corn may potentially decrease water use. However, no cumulative effects have been identified
for this issue.
Animal and Plant Communities
Animals
Corn production systems in agriculture are host many animal species. Mammals and birds may
seasonally use grain, and invertebrates can feed on the plant during the entire growing season.
The cumulative effects analysis for this issue is found below at “Cumulative Effects: Plants,
Animals, Biodiversity.”
No Action: Animals
Under the “no action” alternative, environmental releases of Event 3272 corn would be under
regulation. Animal incursions are limited during regulated field trials, but may occur. However,
the consultation with FDA has been successfully completed for Event 3272 corn (Appendix H),
which addressed any concerns of composition, as well as demonstrated a lack of toxicity and
allergenicity, of Event 3272 corn for human and animal consumption.
Preferred Alternative: Animals
APHIS has reviewed the data submitted by the applicant that confirmed the absence of
deleterious effects for wildlife when feeding on Event 3272 corn. The data are similar to what
was submitted during the FDA consultation process for Event 3272 corn (Appendix H).
Agronomic practices used to produce Event 3272 corn will be the same as used to production
conventionally grown corn, thus the effects discussion for Event 3272 corn on animals will focus
solely on the effects of the introduced proteins in Event 3272 corn, the alpha-amylase enzyme
and the phosphomannose enzyme (used as a selectable marker for Event 3272 corn).
Event 3272 corn contains the alpha-amylase protein, AMY797E, which is found predominantly
in the corn kernels of Event 3272 corn plants (1627 µg/g fresh weight in the dough stage), with
minute amounts found in the roots during the whole stage (<0.1 µg/g fresh weight) and in the
leaves during senescence (<1 µg/g fresh weight) (Table 3-3 of petition). Animals that feed
primarily on corn kernels are seed-feeding insects and rodents found in agricultural fields.
During field trials, the applicant found no changes in insect feeding damage (Table 5-7 of
petition), indicating similar insect susceptibility for Event 3272 corn compared to conventional
corn. Event 3272 corn has not been genetically engineered to produce any pesticides.
Rodents, such as mice or squirrels, may seasonally feed exclusively on corn kernels. Thus, these
animals are most likely to have a diet containing large amounts of corn kernels. Using the
dietary calculations (pages 93-94 of petition) along with the results of a mouse toxicity study
(page 50 of petition and page 6 of response letter), the applicant determined that the no observed
effect dose (NOED) of AMY797E was greater than 2 times the maximum amount of alpha-
