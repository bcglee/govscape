compared the compositional data with published literature values for each analyte to assess
whether statistically significant differences in the composition of the event 3272-derived
hybrids and the corresponding near-isogenic control maize were biologically meaningful.
6.1 Forage Composition
Syngenta determined the levels of the following analytes in forage from corn event
3272derived and the near-isogenic control hybrids collected at the R4 development
stage. The following groups of analytes were measured:
z Proximates
z Minerals
A list of specific analytes contained in each group is shown in Table 2. Syngenta reported
34
mean values for these analytes fell within published literature ranges. , Syngenta conducted
5
a combined statistical analysis of forage data from all three field trials for analytes marked
with
an asterisk (*) in Table 2, and found statistically significant differences between the event
3272derived hybrids and their near-isogenic control lines for protein, carbohydrate and acid
detergent fiber (ADF). Protein levels were statistically significantly higher, and
carbohydrates and ADF were significantly lower in event 3272-derived hybrids than their
respective near-isogenic control lines. Syngenta concluded that these differences were not
biologically meaningful.
