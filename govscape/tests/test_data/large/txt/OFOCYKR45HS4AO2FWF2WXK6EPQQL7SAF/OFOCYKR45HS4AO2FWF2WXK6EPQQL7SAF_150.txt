Plasmid pNOV7013 contains several genes on its plasmid backbone necessary for
maintenance and selection of the plasmid. These sequences are not intended for transfer into
the plant genome. The plasmid backbone of pNOV7013 contains origins of replication that
allow replication of the plasmid in both Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Escherichia coli.
The plasmid contains the spec gene encoding the Tn7 adenylyltransferase conferring
resistance to erythromycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin. pNOV7013 also contains the
virG gene, which is a gene involved in regulation of virulence in A. tumefaciens, and the
repA gene, which is a gene responsible for plasmid replication in Gram-negative, plant-
associated bacteria.
3.2 Characterization, Stability and Inheritance of the Introduced DNA
Syngenta performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction digests, and Southern blot
analysis to support its conclusion that corn event 3272 contains one intact copy of its
amy797E and pmi expression cassette. Syngenta determined the nucleotide sequence of the
T-DNA region present in corn event 3272 to demonstrate the integrity of the insert.
