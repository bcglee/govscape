As demonstrated above, the deregulation of Event 3272 will result in the market entry
of another specialty corn product that is identity preserved, safe for food and feed, produced
in a closed loop system, and carefully managed consistent with the robust suite of safeguards
in place in the market for value-added specialty grain products. NEPA analysis for this event
necessarily begins with an identification of the relevant environmental concerns, a hard look
at the significance of those concerns for a specialty grain product, and an explanation of the
conclusions resulting from that hard look.67
A. Identification of Relevant Environmental Concerns
As described in the July 7, 2007 draft programmatic EIS, APHIS has identified three
general categories of effects that are relevant to its assessment of risks to the human
environment under NEPA. These include potential changes in weediness and invasiveness
(including gene flow and persistence in the environment); potential effects of plants on the
soil; and impacts on human health (including human allergenicity).68
B. A “Hard-Look” Analysis of the Effect of the Identity-Preserved, Closed-
Loop Specialty Grain Management System, Legal Recordkeeping
Requirements and Supporting Quality Management Systems.
The hard look required of the agency prior to issuing a FONSI is a critical evaluation
of whether the impacts of the action are significant in terms of context and intensity. Context
refers to the setting within which the proposed action takes place.69 In considering context,
an agency must look at the significance of an action analyzed in several contexts such as
society as a whole (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the
locality.”70 The term “intensity” refers to “the severity of the impact”71 judged on a number
of factors. As demonstrated below, the deregulation of Event 3272 is not significant on either
factor.
