relevant environmental effect in the draft EIS for purposes of NEPA analysis in support of
deregulation.79 This approach is consistent with Supreme Court precedent on the types of
environmental effects that trigger the NEPA procedural assessment requirements. “[T]he
theme of [§ 4332(c) of NEPA] is sounded by the adjective ‘environmental’ . . . the context of
the statute shows that Congress was talking about the physical environment – the world
around us, so to speak.”80
The suitability effect is a commercial use issue, not an effect on the physical
environment. Unlike the Geerston court’s evaluation of the alfalfa deregulation decision, the
deregulation of Event 3272 does not present any substantial or unanswered questions
regarding gene transmission to non-genetically engineered corn. Corn is an intensively
managed annual crop into which multiple biotech events have already been introduced.
Alfalfa, by contrast, is a perennial crop pollinated by bees to which herbicide tolerance is
being newly introduced. Nor does deregulation of Event 3272 present any issue relating to
the development of additional pesticide resistance or increased use of herbicides. Event 3272
introduces a special output trait. As noted above, it does not enhance the competitiveness or
resistance of this corn plant.
Moreover, even if APHIS were to determine that commercial use issues should be
included in its analysis of relevant environmental effects, the functionality effects of Event
3272 have been effectively mitigated by requiring steps to ensure that this specialty grain is
directed to its economically productive use and away from use as an ingredient in certain
applications. The identity-preserved, closed-loop specialty grain management systems, grain
traceability recordkeeping requirements, and supporting quality management systems in use
in the grain management industry today are fully capable of ensuring the separation
necessary to avoid any unintended commingling and associated commercial use effect.
Treated as mitigation measures, these steps are sufficient to bring the potential adverse
suitability impacts below the level of significance.
Accordingly, Syngenta’s decision to commercialize Event 3272 as a specialty grain
produced in a closed-loop system would be fully supported by an EA and FONSI even if the
functionality effect were considered to be an effect on the human environment for purposes
of NEPA analysis. It is well-established that even where an effect may be considered to be
significant if unmitigated, an EA and FONSI will satisfy NEPA’s “hard look” requirements
where mitigation can reduce those effects below the level of significance.81
The masa example provides an excellent example of how the mitigation created by
the closed-loop production system reduces the significance of the effects of Event 3272 on
