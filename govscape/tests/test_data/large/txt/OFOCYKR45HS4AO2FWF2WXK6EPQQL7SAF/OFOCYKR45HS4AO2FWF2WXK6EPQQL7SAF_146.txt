produced amylase during processing. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the
alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of amylase and amylopectin polymers into dextrins,
maltose, and glucose. The recombinant enzyme is stable and active at high
temperatures of dry grind ethanol production.
Syngenta states that, based on its safety assessment, corn event 3272 is as safe as
other corn lines, and as such may be used as food, feed or in the production of food
products or ingredients. However, Syngenta states that grain from corn event 3272
is primarily targeted for the dry grind fuel ethanol production industry in the United
States.

3. Genetic Modifications and Characterization
3.1 Transformation Plasmid and Parential Variety
Syngenta constructed the plasmid vector pNOV7013. The plasmid contains two expression
cassettes within its T-DNA region. The T-DNA region contains a single copy of the
amy797E alpha-amylase expression cassette and a single copy of the phosphomannose
isomerase (pmi) expression cassette as a selectable marker. The T-DNA region of
pNOV7013 was incorporated into immature corn embryo cells from a proprietary corn line
(NP2499/NP2500) using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The T-DNA region of
pNOV7013 contains the following genetic elements.

pNOV7013.
