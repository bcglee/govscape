3272 corn is considered safe for use in food and feed. There are no cumulative effects identified
for this issue.
Gene Movement
A potential environmental impact to consider as a result of planting this corn variety is the
potential for gene flow (the transfer of genetic information between different individuals and/or
populations). Pollen flow, or the movement of genes from one plant to another, occurs between
plants that are sexually-compatible, or able to receive pollen at the appropriate time during the
appropriate plant stage. Corn does not have sexually-compatible relatives found in ‘natural’
area; corn is only able to reproduce with other corn plants in the U.S. [see (USDA-APHIS
2008)].
Corn pollen moves by the wind to other corn fields that are nearby. Successful gene movement
from one plant to another requires many different biological and physical factors, such as
synchrony of flowering between corn fields, viability of pollen, and presence of physical
barriers; thus pollen movement is not equivalent to gene movement. A recent paper (Sanvido et
al. 2008) reviewed studies investigating gene flow and gene movement studies in corn grain
production fields, and using the data found that the gene movement from GE corn to non-GE
corn typically remained below 0.5% at 50m (approx. 164ft), and this result was validated when
analyzing cross-fertilization events in large scale studies (e.g. (Henry et al. 2003, Weber et al.
2007).
One study found cross-fertilization rates higher at comparable distances than other studies (Jones
and Brooks 1950). Jones and Brooks (1950) found successful gene movement to be as high as
2.5 % at 660ft. One potential reason for the discrepancy between this study and almost all other
gene flow studies in corn may be due to the type of corn used in this study. Jones and Brooks
(1950) investigated the appropriate isolation distance for seed production in open-pollinated
varieties, and not for hybrid varieties. Due the biology of open-pollinated varieties, these types
of plants may be more receptive to pollen over a longer period of time than hybrid corn plants
(Sanvido et al. 2008), allowing for a greater chance of pollination events. Thus the results from
Jones and Brooks (1950) may be an overestimation of cross-fertilization potential for hybrid corn
plants.
No Action: Gene Movement
Under the “no action” alternative, Event 3272 corn would remain a regulated article and would
require a permit or notification for release into the environment. Under regulated releases, GE
corn is typically separated from non-regulated corn by a distance of 660ft, based on distances set
for seed production (AOSCA 2004), if distance is the only method used to prevent movement of
pollen or genes.
Preferred Alternative: Gene Movement
In 2008, GE corn production is planted on 80% of all corn acres currently in production in the
US, and the use of GE corn has been steadily increasing (USDA-NASS 2006, 2007a, 2008a).
Concurrently, organic corn acreage is also increasing at approximately 30% a year (USDA-ERS
2008a), even though there are no requirements that GE corn currently in production use
mandated techniques for separation between the two types of corn varieties.
