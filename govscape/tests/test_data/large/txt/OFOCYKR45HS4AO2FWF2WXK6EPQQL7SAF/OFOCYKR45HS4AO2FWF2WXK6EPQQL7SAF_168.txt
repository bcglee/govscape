Plant Pest Any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of insects,
mites, nematodes, slugs, snails, protozoa, or other invertebrate animals,
bacteria, fungi, other parasitic plants or reproductive parts thereof;
viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing;
or any infectious agents or substances, which can directly or indirectly
injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof,
or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants. (7 CFR
340.1)
Plasmid An circular self-replicating non-chromosomal DNA molecule found in
many bacteria, capable of transfer between bacterial cells of the same
species, and occasionally of different species. Antibiotic resistance
genes are frequently located on plasmids. Plasmids are particularly
important as vectors for genetic engineering (FAO)

Proline
An amino acid. Some plant cells accumulate proline as an
osmoprotectant.
Promoter A region of DNA located upstream of a gene that controls to what
degree, where, and/or when a gene is expressed.
Push Test Scores The number of plants out of 10 plants tested that break at the stalk or
have root failure after pushing to 45 degrees from vertical.
R
Recombinant DNA
The manipulation of DNA in which DNA, including DNA from
Technology
different organisms, is cut apart and recombined using enzymes.
Recombination The physical exchange of genetic material between two genetic
sequences that produces new combinations of genetic information.
(See Homologous recombination and Non-homologous
recombination.)
Regulated Article Subject to APHIS regulation under 7 CFR part 340.
Regulatory A DNA sequence involved in regulating the expression of a gene, e.g.
sequence a promoter or operator region (in the DNA molecule) (FAO)
Ribonucleic Acid A nucleic acid composed of a long, often single-stranded chain of
(RNA) chemical building blocks called ‘nucleotides.’ RNA has multiple
functions in the process of translating information stored in genes
(DNA) into proteins.
Ribonucleic Acid See RNA.
Rotation
In crop production, the cycle of crops grown in successive years in the
same field. Rotations are instituted to limit the spread and
accumulation of diseases (especially soil-borne diseases) and pests and
to manage plant nutrients.
S
Self-pollinated
The tendency of a plant species to produce offspring that result from a
