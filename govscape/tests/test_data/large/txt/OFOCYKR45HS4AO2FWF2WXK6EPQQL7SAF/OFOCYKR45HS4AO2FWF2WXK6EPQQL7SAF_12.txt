Biofuels have been championed and pilloried as an alternative, renewable energy source.
Proponents believe that corn-produced ethanol can increase energy security, reduce vehicle
emissions and provide a new income stream for farmers. Critics assert that corn-based ethanol
will increase energy-price volatility, food prices, and even increase life-cycle emissions of
greenhouse gases and decrease water table levels.
There are two types of ethanol processing plants in the U.S., dry-grind and wet-milling plants.
Dry mill facilities account for 82% of ethanol production and wet mills 18% (RFA 2007). As
Event 3272 corn will be produced for dry-grind ethanol production, this assessment will include
only those related to dry-grind ethanol processing using corn as the feedstock.
The American Coalition for Ethanol, a pro-ethanol website, has an interactive tour of an ethanol
processing plants at http://www.ethanol.org/index.php?id=73&parentid=73 (accessed 7/8/08).
Below is a review of the dry-grind ethanol process from information from the Renewable Fuels
Association, also a proponent of ethanol, and Mosier and Ileleji (Mosier and Ileleji 2006):
There are 5 major steps in the dry-grind method of ethanol production:
1. Milling. In dry milling, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred
to in the industry as "meal" and processed without separating out the various component
