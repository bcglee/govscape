further considered during the decision process. Based on this evaluation, APHIS rejected several
alternatives. In the interest of transparency, these alternatives are discussed briefly below along
with the specific reasons for rejecting each.
Prohibit any Event 3272 corn from being released.
In response to public comments that stated a preference that no GE organisms enter the
marketplace, APHIS considered prohibiting the release Event 3272 corn, including denying any
permits associated with the field testing. APHIS determined that this alternative is not
appropriate in that Event 3272 corn has been determined in APHIS’ Plant Pest Risk Assessment
not to be a likely plant pest (USDA-APHIS 2008). APHIS has no jurisdiction over plants that
have been deemed not to be plant pests.
The Secretary of Agriculture is directed, through APHIS, to facilitate—
“… the smooth movement of enterable plants, plant products, biological control organisms,
or other articles into, out of, or within the United States… (and to facilitate) exports,
imports, and interstate commerce in agricultural products and other commodities that pose
a risk of harboring plant pests or noxious weeds in ways that will reduce, to the extent
practicable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of dissemination of plant pests or
noxious weeds… § 402(3)(5).”
The question as to how to balance this facilitation with the protection of U.S. agriculture is
unequivocally answered by Congress, which states that—
“…decisions affecting imports, exports, and interstate movement of products regulated
under (the Plant Protection Act) shall be based on sound science… § 402(4).”
A risk-management process based on sound science must, therefore, consider a growing body of
scientific evidence documenting the safe use of GE organisms in U.S. agriculture, and in the rest
of the world, to determine whether their use poses any unacceptable risks. Because Congress has
mandated a science-based approach in APHIS regulations and because there is no basis in
science for banning the release of Event 3272 corn, a blanket prohibition of the release of Event
3272 corn would contravene congressional intent and must be rejected.
Isolation distance between Event 3272 corn and non-GE corn production
In response to public concerns of gene movement between GE and non-GE plants, APHIS
considered requiring an isolation distance greater than 660ft separating Event 3272 corn from
non-GE corn production. However, because Event 3272 corn is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk
(USDA-APHIS 2008), APHIS has no regulatory authority over Event 3272 corn and is unable to
require management practices for this GE corn variety.
Geographic restrictions
In response to public concerns of gene movement between GE and non-GE plants, APHIS
considered restricting the production of Event 3272 corn based on production of non-GE corn in
organic production systems or production systems for GE-sensitive markets. State-level and
county-level restrictions of Event 3272 corn, as well as the establishment of GE-free corn
production zones were rejected because Event 3272 corn is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk
(USDA-APHIS 2008). Therefore APHIS has no regulatory authority over Event 3272 corn and
is unable to impose restrictions on this GE corn variety.
