corn products are misdirected into production streams for which they were not intended. In the
case of Event 3272 corn, food processes that use alkaline cooking, such as processes that
produce masa tortillas and corn-based snack foods, may be affected through changes in dough-
handling or darkened chip color, if Event 3272 corn is accidently included in the process
(Appendices F-H). However, the masa industry also uses strict grain sourcing programs, and
only an estimated 4% of the corn used in masa production is from the open market (and not
through direct contracts with a grower) (Appendix G). Corn hybrids used for masa production
are specifically developed with improved alkaline-cooking properties, and premiums are paid for
growing, delivering, and meeting and maintain the purity and quality standards of corn for masa
production (Appendix G). Thus both Event 3272 corn and corn hybrids for masa production are
grown under strong stewardship programs.
In the unlikely event that Event 3272 corn enters a masa facility, mixing of a truck-load of Event
3272 corn into holding bin of corn for masa production results in a dilution of 5x (see Appendix
F and Appendix G for scenario development). Further dilution is possible if the truck-load of
Event 3272 corn entered a local grain elevator, which may reduce the effects that Event 3272
corn may have on masa production. According to Syngenta, an additional consideration is that
less than 10% of corn fields that currently support ethanol plants (areas where Event 3272 corn
will be grown), are in the production area for masa-contracted corn fields (Appendix G). Thus,
the potential for the misdirection of Event 3272 corn to a masa facility is likely remote.
Cumulative Effects: Specialty Corn
The availability of methods used to separate specialty corn products from corn used as grain
would be the same as currently used in corn production systems, and are no changes are
foreseeable. No cumulative effects identified for this issue.
Ethanol Production
Ethanol production is an integral part of meeting the renewable fuels standard (RFS) in the U.S.
The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, signed on August 8, 2005, includes a Renewable Fuels
Standard that directs the doubling of the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the U.S. fuel supply by
2012 to 7.5 billion gallons (42 USC 15801, page 1069). The Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007 passed in December, 2007, includes a provision to expand consumption of
alternative fuels, including but not limited to ethanol, to 36 billion gallons in 2022. With over
161 ethanol plants in operation in 26 different states, and more than 40 more under construction,
corn-based ethanol production may be a feasible way to meet the ethanol consumption
benchmark for 2012 set in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Currently, more than 90 % of U.S.
ethanol is made from corn (Morris and Hill 2006).
No Action: Ethanol Production
Under the “no action” alternative, the process used for ethanol production would remain the
same. Efficiency of ethanol production would remain at 2.7 gallons/bushel of corn. Corn-based
ethanol production would still be used as one method to meet the benchmarks set by Congress in
terms of biofuel consumption in the U.S.
Preferred Alternative: Ethanol Production
The use of Event 3272 corn in ethanol production could result in changes in inputs, methods, and
capital costs during ethanol production. Each of the potential changes is due to the substitution
