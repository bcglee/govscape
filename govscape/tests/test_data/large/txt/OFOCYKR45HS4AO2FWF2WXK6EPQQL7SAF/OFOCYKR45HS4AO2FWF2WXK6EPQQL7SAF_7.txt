PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
APHIS-BRS routinely seeks public comment on draft environmental assessments. The issues
discussed in this EA were developed by considering the public concern for ethanol production,
as well as issues raised in public comments submitted for other environmental assessments of
genetically engineered organisms, concerns raised in lawsuits, as well as those issues of concern
that have been raised by various stakeholders. These issues, including those regarding the
agricultural production of genetically engineered corn, the potential coexistence of all types of
agricultural methods, and the environmental and food/feed safety of genetically engineered
plants were addressed to analyze the potential environmental impacts of Event 3272 corn.
This EA and the petition submitted by Syngenta will be available for public comment for a
period of 60 days (7 CFR § 340.6(d)(2)). Comments received by the end of the 60-day period
will be analyzed and used to inform APHIS to grant nonregulated status in whole, or that an
Environmental Impact Statement of Event 3272 corn is necessary prior to the decision of
whether to grant nonregulated status to this corn variety.
ISSUES
As stated above, the issues considered in this EA were developed based on APHIS’
determination to deregulate certain genetically engineered organisms, and for this particular EA,
the specific deregulation of Event 3272 corn for ethanol production.
Management Considerations:
• Corn Production
• Cropping Practices
• Tillage Practices
• Pesticide Use
• Coexistence
• Impact to Other Specialty Corn Products
• Ethanol Production
