DECISIONS TO BE MADE
APHIS will make a determination to grant nonregulated status for Event 3272 corn, given that
Event 3272 corn is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk (USDA-APHIS 2008). APHIS will also use
the information from this EA, and the comments received, to inform APHIS’ decisionmaker in
determining whether to grant nonregulated status in whole, or to not to grant nonregulated status,
or that an Environmental Impact Statement of Event 3272 corn is necessary prior to the decision
of whether to grant nonregulated status to this corn variety.
