corn roots and crop soils would still be affected by agronomic practices associated with
conventional corn cultivation.
Preferred Alternative: Soil Biology
If Event 3272 corn is granted nonregulated status under the “preferred” alternative, soil
interactions with Event 3272 corn would happen at a large scale. Cultivation practices
associated with regulated releases of Event 3272 corn would be the same as conventional corn
production. The soil environment would be modified by corn roots and crop soils would still be
affected by agronomic practices associated with conventional corn cultivation.
Cumulative Effects: Soil Biology
Event 3272 corn was found to have small amounts of the alpha-amylase protein (AMY797E) in
the roots during the whole stage (<0.1 µg/g fresh weight). One concern may be the potential of
additional amounts of AMY797E contributes to alpha-amylase levels in agricultural soils.
One study estimated potential amounts of alpha-amylase in agricultural soils over time and space
due to the use of Event 3272 corn. Wolt and Karaman (Wolt and Karaman 2007) assumed levels
of AMY797E in grain, leaves, and roots to extrapolate and estimate environmental amounts of
alpha-amylase in corn fields in Iowa. According to their calculations, they projected an order of
magnitude increase in the amount of alpha-amylase, due to increased amounts of AMY797E, in
soils in Iowa corn fields. According to the authors, the potential environmental consequence of
the increased loading of alpha-amylase due to AMY797E in agricultural soils was conjectured to
be possibly connected to changes in carbon cycling, which in turn may possibly affect the
microbial soil community (Wolt and Karaman 2007).
Amylases, including alpha-amylases, are enzymes that are ubiquitous in nature and naturally
occur in soils. In soil, a high diversity of alpha-amylases are commonly found (Rondon et al.
2000). The microbial soil community and activity is complex, with a multitude of chemical and
enzymatic interactions. Soils that have healthy microbial activity produce sufficient levels of
proteases to degrade most proteins (Marx et al. 2005). Thermostability in and of itself is not a
characteristic related to the ability of an enzyme to degrade, or persist for that matter, in
agricultural soils. Although the calculations by Wolt and Karaman (2007) suggest the potential
for increased environmental amounts of alpha-amylase in agricultural crops where Event 3272
corn is grown, the calculations fail to consider the potential for natural degradation of
AMY797E. Digestibility data presented to APHIS and FDA (Appendix H) by Syngenta show
degradation of AMY797E by a single protease, pepsin. Although pepsin is not normally found
in soils, the data do suggest that AMY797E is not inherently indigestible or non-degradable.
Wolt and Karaman (2007) did not present any empirical evidence to suggest that AMY797E
would persist. An abstract was cited (Kosaki et al. 2006) that found soil persistence of another
thermostable protein, however the comparison between the two proteins was based on the
thermostability of each of the proteins, and not the degradability of the proteins. The authors also
did not present empirical evidence that AMY797E will accumulate in soil.
Because small amounts of AMY797E are found in the roots (<0.1 µg/g fresh weight), the main
avenue for AMY797E to find its way into the soil is through the degradation of grain. Grain is
the main source of AMY797E, and Event 3272 corn was engineered to produce alpha-amylase in
the grain because ethanol production uses grain as the starting material. Event 3272 grain
