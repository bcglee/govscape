weight) and in the leaves during senescence (<1 µg/g fresh weight) (Table 3-3 of petition).
Animals that feed primarily on corn kernels are seed-feeding insects and rodents found in
agricultural fields. During field trials, the applicant found no changes in insect feeding damage
(Table 5-7 of petition), indicating similar insect susceptibility for Event 3272 corn compared to
conventional corn.
Rodents, such as mice or squirrels, may seasonally feed exclusively on corn kernels. Thus, these
animals are most likely to have a diet containing large amounts of corn kernels. Using the
dietary calculations (pages 93-94 of petition) along with the results of a mouse toxicity study
(page 50 of petition and page 6 of response letter), the applicant determined that the no observed
effect dose (NOED) of AMY797E was greater than 2 times the maximum amount of alpha-
amylase corn a rodent might consume daily (page 94 of petition). Other mammals, such as deer,
would have even lower exposure to AMY797E because of feeding habits; for example, deer
nibble on tips of corn ears as opposed to kernels (Steffey et al. 1999). Thus, there would be no
negative impact to TES mammals that forage in Event 3272 corn.
The applicant also evaluated the effects of AMY797E on birds by feeding broiler chickens diets
that contained up to 65% of Event 3272 grain for 49 days (page 94 of petition and page 6 of
response letter). The applicant reported no harmful effects to chickens from a diet extremely
high in AMY797E. Moreover, given that diets high in AMY797E do not result in harmful
effects, the diets of wild birds that occasionally forage in corn fields, including threatened and
endangered species such as the whooping crane, are unlikely to contain high amounts of
AMY797E for 49 consecutive days as corn availability is limited by seed germination and
harvest.
Additionally, threatened and endangered species have been previously exposed to alpha-
amylases in the environment, as they are ubiquitous enzymes found in microorganisms, plants,
and animals (Janeček et al. 1999). AMY797E also does not have any significant sequence
identity to any known toxins (page 7 of response letter). As stated earlier, AMY797E is
functionally similar to thermostable alpha-amylases already safely used in food and feed
processing (Janeček et al. 1999, Lévêque et al. 2000, Pariza and Johnson 2001, Olempska-Beer
et al. 2006), indicating that Event 3272 corn is unlikely to produce toxins that would negatively
effect animals that may eat corn kernels or plants containing AMY797E.
Organisms exposed to AMY797E will also be exposed to PMI. Additional species, such as leaf-
feeding animals, butterflies and bees, may not be exposed to AMY797E but will be exposed to
PMI because of its expression in vegetative tissue and pollen (Table 3-4 of petition). The pmi
(manA) gene comes from E. coli and encodes the enzyme phosphomannose isomerase (PMI).
Pmi serves as a marker gene that enables selection of lines that are genetically modified,
providing the plant with the ability to utilize mannose as a sole carbon source. Table 3-4 of the
petition gives the PMI expression data for Event 3272 corn. PMI expression was examined
during 5 developmental stages of Event 3272 corn (whorl, anthesis, kernel dough, kernel
maturity, and senescence). In Event 3272 corn, PMI is expressed in leaves during all stages
except senescence, with maximum expression during the kernel dough stage (5.7 µg/g fresh
weight). Expression of PMI in the roots occurs during all developmental stages with the highest
expression of 1.0 µg/g fresh weight during the whorl stage. The highest PMI expression for
kernels occurred during the kernel dough stage (0.8 µg/g fresh weight), and 8.5 µg/g fresh
weight of PMI was expressed in the pollen. The expression of PMI protein in corn plants is not
