M
Marker Gene A gene of known function or known location that is inherited in
Mendelian fashion and facilitates the study of inheritance of a nearby
gene.
Microorganism An organism that is microscopic (too small to be seen by the human
eye).
Monocot A flowering plant with only one embryonic seed leaf. Examples
include grasses, irises, lilies, and onions. (See Dicot.)
Monoecious A plant species that has separate male and female flowers on the same
plant (e.g. maize) (FAO)
MOU Memorandum of Understanding.
N
NEPA The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and subsequent
amentments.
NOI Notice of Intent.
Non-target An organism which is affected by a treatment (e.g. pesticide
organisms application) for which it was not the intended recipient (FAO).
Northern corn leaf Corn disease caused by the fungus Exserohilum turcicum
blight
Notification An administratively-streamlined alternative to a permit for the
introduction of a regulated GE plant. The GE plant must meet specified
eligibility criteria, and the introduction must meet certain pre-defined
performance standards.
O
OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Outcrossing The tendency of a plant species to produce offspring that result from
the mating of two different individual plants. (See Self-pollinated.)
Overwintering Time at which plants experience ‘winter conditions’ where growth of
vegetative tissues and reproductive structures becomes minimal or
ceases completely. (wiki)
P
Percent snapped Percent of plants per plot broken prior to anthesis due to adverse
plants environmental conditions, such as high wind speeds. Used as a
measure of abiotic stress tolerance.
Permits An application to BRS for the introduction of GE organisms that pose
a plant pest risk, including plants, insects, or microbes.
Persistence Ability of an organism to remain in a particular setting for a period of
time after it is introduced (FAO)
Phenotype The appearance or other characteristics of an organism, resulting from
the interaction of its genetic constitution with the environment.
Phosphomannose Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), an enzyme not present in many
isomerase plants, catalyzes the reversible interconversion of mannose 6-
phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. Plant cells lacking this enzyme
are incapable of surviving on synthetic medium containing mannose.
