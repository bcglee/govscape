Thus, under the preferred alternative, granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn would not
increase the demand for corn production, or alone cause an increase in overall GE corn acreage.
Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn has the potential to result in a decrease in
acreage devoted to corn produced for ethanol production due to a projected 2% or greater
increase in ethanol efficiency – fewer bushels of corn may be needed to meet the requirements of
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.
Cumulative Effects: Acreage and Areas of Corn Production
Cumulative effects of granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn are unlikely. Granting
nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn will not cause an increase in agricultural acreage devoted
to corn production, or those corn acres devoted to GE corn cultivation. Event 3272 corn will
also not change future cultivation areas for corn production in the U.S. There are no foreseeable
changes to the availability of GE and conventional corn varieties on the market.
Cropping practices
Crop Rotation
No Action: Crop Rotation
The current economics of corn production are driving the change or perceived change in crop
rotation practices. Growers make choices to plant certain corn varieties and use certain crop
rotation practices based on factors such as yield, weed and disease pressures, cost of seed and
other inputs, technology fees, human safety, potential for crop injury, and ease and flexibility of
the production system (Olson and Sander 1988, Giannessi 2005). Therefore, when taking into
account these factors, growers will ultimately base their choice on individual wants and needs.
As the demand for ethanol production has increased, the frequency of corn-to-corn crop rotations
has also increased in areas that support ethanol production (Hart 2006, Stockton et al. 2007), to
derive the benefits associated with the increases in corn prices on the commodity market. The
average field corn prices have increased from $2.00/bushel in 2005 (USDA-NASS 2007b), to
$3.04/bushel in 2006, and $4.00/bushel in 2007 (USDA-NASS 2008b). These prices are driven
by demand for corn products in ethanol and for feed. Under the “no action” alternative, the
demands and price increases in corn will continue to increase depending on the market for field
corn, and corn-to-corn rotations will continue to be used by farmers if this cropping practice
meets the economic and marketing strategy for the particular farmer.
Preferred Alternative: Crop Rotation
As stated above, the current economics of corn production are driving the change or perceived
change in crop rotation practices. Granting nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn is unlikely to
change the entire pricing scheme of corn commodities in the U.S. Prices will continue to be set
by market demand, without regard to the number or type of corn varieties available on the
market. Event 3272 corn is unlikely to affect a farmer’s decision to either stop using a corn-to-
corn rotation, or to increase the overall use of corn-to-corn rotation as a cropping strategy with
the U.S. farming community.
Cumulative Effects: Crop Rotation
Under the “no action” alternative, the cumulative effects of using crop-to-crop rotation could be
an cumulative increase level in corn pests found in corn fields or an cumulative increase in
fertilizer use due to continuing use of corn crops (instead of rotating in a nitrogen-fixing crop
