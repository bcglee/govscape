agency uses to determine whether the regulated article is unlikely to present a greater plant pest
risk than the unmodified organism. If, based on this information, the agency determines that the
article is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk, the article may be granted deregulated status.
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?
APHIS has received a petition from Syngenta Seeds, Inc. (Syngenta) for a determination of
nonregulated status for a corn variety (Event 3272) genetically engineered to produce a microbial
enzyme that facilitates ethanol production. Syngenta requests that APHIS make a determination
that these corn plants shall no longer be considered regulated articles under 7 CFR part 340.
NEED FOR EVENT 3272 CORN
The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, signed on August 8, 2005, includes a Renewable Fuels
Standard that directs the doubling of the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the U.S. fuel supply by
2012 to 7.5 billion gallons (42 USC 15801, page 1069). The Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007 passed in December, 2007, includes a provision to expand consumption of
alternative fuels, including but not limited to ethanol, to 36 billion gallons in 2022. With over
161 ethanol plants in operation in 26 different states, and more than 40 more under construction,
corn-based ethanol production may be a feasible way to meet the ethanol consumption
benchmark for 2012 set in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and 2022 goals set by the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007.
Ethanol has also become the oxygenate of choice for reformulated gasoline (RFG), due to state
bans of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and the increased liability to oil companies for MTBE
spills (Hoffman et al. 2007). As provided in the Federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990,
cities with the worst smog pollution are required to use RFG, while other cities voluntarily
adopted the RFG program. The decreased use of MTBE in RFG, and the subsequent benchmark
set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007,
along with other Federal programs and policies [see (Hoffman et al. 2007) and (Schnepf 2006)
for a thorough discussion], have combined to stimulate the demand for ethanol.
OBJECTIVES FOR EVENT 3272 CORN
Event 3272 corn is expected to help the U.S. meet its goals for ethanol production. According to
the company, the overall efficiency of the dry grind process with using Event 3272 grain is
greater than conventional dry ethanol production, due to greater ethanol production per unit
Event 3272 grain, and greater throughput efficiency during the dry grind process itself.
Event 3272 corn has been field tested in the United States since 2002 as authorized by USDA
notifications and permits listed in Table 1-1, on page 17 of the Petition. The list compiles a
number of test sites in diverse regions of the U.S. including the major corn growing areas of the
Midwest and winter nurseries in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Field tests conducted under APHIS
oversight allow for evaluation of Event 3272 corn in a natural agricultural setting while imposing
measures to minimize the risk of persistence in the environment after the completion of the test.
Data are gathered on multiple parameters and are used by the applicants to evaluate agronomic
characteristics and product performance, and are used by APHIS to determine if the new variety
poses a plant pest risk (USDA-APHIS 2008).
Once APHIS determines that a GE organism is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk, APHIS does not
have any regulatory authority over the GE variety and it may be traditionally bred with other
