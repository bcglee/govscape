between GE and non-GE corn. Given that 80% of corn production is GE, the DDGS produced
and used as animal feed are likely produced with some GE corn varieties.
Because of the near complete fermentation of starch during the ethanol process, the remaining
amino acids, fat, minerals and vitamins in DDGS increase approximately three-fold in
concentration compared to levels found in corn (Rausch and Belyea 2006). This can result in
concerns regarding phosphorous and animal waste dispose, sulfur diet content, and mycotoxin
concentrations in DDGS.
Phosphorous concentrations in DDGS can significantly increase both phosphorus diet content as
well as the resulting animal waste products when used as feed (Morse et al. 1992). Increased
phosphorus in animal waste leads to waste disposal concerns (Rausch and Belyea 2006) and
concerns about increased levels of phosphorus pollution of local and national bodies of water
through agricultural runoff.
High dietary sulfur concentration in DDGS may also be a concern; it can lead to excessive
sulfide concentrations in the rumen, and may cause a shift in the ruminal microbial population to
include bacteria that produce high levels of thiaminases (Rausch and Belyea 2006). This reduces
the thiamine available to be absorbed from the rumen and results in an effective thiamine
deficiency which may cause brain lesions (Rausch and Belyea 2006). The bacteria also produce
an analog that inhibits certain enzymes involved in energy metabolism (Kung et al. 1998).
Mycotoxins may also be concentrated in DDGS. Mycotoxins are poisons produced by some
fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium). The growth of fungi and the production of
mycotoxins can be associated with stressed plants in the field (e.g., drought, pest damage) or
poor storage after harvest (Whitlow and Hagler 2005). During ethanol processing, mycotoxins
are not destroyed; the toxins are concentrated three-fold during ethanol processing, resulting in
DDGS that may contain significantly increased levels of mycotoxins compared to corn grain for
feed (Garcia et al. 2008).
One of the mycotoxin metabolites present in corn, and potentially present in the resultant DDGS,
aflatoxin M1, may be a concern to human health. If M1 is present in corn feed or DDGS and fed
to dairy cattle, M1 can be passed in milk for human consumption (Garcia et al. 2008). M1, a
metabolite Aflatoxin B1, is considered a potential carcinogenic compound for humans. Because
of the human health concerns surrounding aflatoxins, aflatoxin is regulated by the FDA at the
action level. Action levels for poisonous or deleterious substances are established by the FDA to
control levels of contaminants in human food and animal feed. These action levels represent
limits at or above which FDA will take legal action to remove products from the market (FDA
2000).
