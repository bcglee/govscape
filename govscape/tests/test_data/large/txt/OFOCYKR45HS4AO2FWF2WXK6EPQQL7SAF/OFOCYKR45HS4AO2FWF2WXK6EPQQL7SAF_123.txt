away from the commercial channels intended for the production of processed corn food
products such as masa. This process includes the Event 3272-specific Syngenta Stewardship
Program, the well-established and recognized ability of the existing commercial marketplace
to manage specialty grain product under contract and quality management systems, the
enhanced legal traceability recordkeeping requirements of the Bioterrorism Act, and a
reliable and widely available Event 3272 detection test.
Event 3272 will be deregulated in the context of a market replete with numerous other
specialty grain products produced and marketed in the U.S. under well-defined identity
preservation and traceability systems. As another specialty grain product, the intensity of the
impact of its deregulation will be very low. As such, a finding of no significant impact can
be made on the basis of the robust controls that govern these systems.

Requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
NEPA requires that agencies undertaking a major Federal action “significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment” provide a detailed statement of the
environmental impact of the proposed action, any adverse environmental effects that cannot
be avoided, and alternatives to the action.”12 Where the significance of an action is
uncertain, agencies may use an Environmental Assessment (“EA”) to identify, analyze, and
evaluate the impacts of the proposed action. The EA will satisfy the NEPA obligation where
it provides sufficient evidence and analysis to support a “finding of no significant impact
(“FONSI”).”13
In order to support such a finding, the agency must have:
• accurately identified the relevant environmental concern;
• taken a hard look at the problem in preparing the environmental assessment, and
• made a convincing case for the FONSI.
If there is an impact of true significance, the preparation of an environmental impact
statement can be avoided only if changes are made that reduce the impacts of the action to a
minimum.14 The test of whether an action “significantly” affects the environment requires
