Introduction
The deregulation of new plant biotechnology events by APHIS is a federal action that
requires evaluation under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).8 APHIS has
historically found that the deregulation of such events in corn have not been “major federal
actions significantly affecting the human environment.”9 NEPA compliance has been
effectuated through an environmental assessment taking the “hard look” at the environmental
effects of the action that has been required by reviewing courts,10 and a finding of no
significant impact.
Event 3272 fits comfortably into this body of NEPA analysis. Event 3272 corn is a
novel transgenic corn variety that contains a genetically inserted thermostable alpha-amylase
enzyme that facilitates the production of ethanol by the dry grind process. Alpha-amylases
are ubiquitous in the environment. They have a long history of safe consumption by humans
and animals and the particular alpha-amylase incorporated in Event 3272 has successfully
completed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food safety consultation process.
Event 3272 presents no unique or novel issues relating to the environmental impacts
that have been identified by APHIS as relevant environmental effects for NEPA analysis.11
Like other specialty corns in the marketplace, Event 3272 may not be suitable for use in
some processing applications, but this does not change the NEPA analysis. Event 3272 will
be grown and managed in the marketplace as a specialty grain produced in a tightly-
controlled, closed loop system. This system will prevent any effect arising from a lack of
suitability for uses for which it is not intended from rising to a level of “significance” under
the relevant NEPA factors of context and intensity. Accordingly, the deregulation of this
event will not significantly affect the human environment within the meaning of NEPA.
The commercial value of Event 3272 is for dedicated ethanol production in the dry
grind process. The realization of that value will be ensured by a closed-loop system that
reliably channels this corn from the production field into dry grind ethanol production and
