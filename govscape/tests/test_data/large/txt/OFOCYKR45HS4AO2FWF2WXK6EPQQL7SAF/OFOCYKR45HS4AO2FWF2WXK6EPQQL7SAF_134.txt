Syngenta Stewardship Program for Event 3272 Corn
A. Description of Event 3272 Corn
Event 3272 corn has been genetically modified to express an optimized alpha-amylase
enzyme specifically developed for use in dry grind ethanol production. This product will serve
as a source of the amylase enzyme in the dry grind ethanol process, replacing the addition of
liquid microbially produced enzyme and significantly improving the overall efficiency of dry
grind ethanol production.58 In addition, it will enable process flexibility that could generate real
benefits at multiple points in the ethanol plant, such as increased ethanol yield, reduced energy
costs, reduced water usage, and reduced chemical usage. Commercialization could also increase
energy yield of corn per acre, ease current tight markets for corn, and contribute substantially to
the advancement of next generation biofuels.59
Alpha-amylases are ubiquitous in the environment and are safe. There is a long history
of safe consumption by humans and animals and/or exposure to both naturally occurring and
commercially produced alpha-amylases. They are naturally present in microorganisms, plants
(including corn), and animals. They are commercially produced for food processing uses such as
baking bread, brewing beer, and producing corn syrup. In addition, a co-product of ethanol
production is sold as an animal feed ingredient. Event 3272 has successfully completed the FDA
food safety consultation process.60 There is no food safety issue associated with the possible
presence of the AMY797E alpha-amylase enzyme in foods.
58 Enzymes such as alpha-amylase and glucoamylase are added during the ethanol production process because
they provide a fast, safe and economical conversion of starch to sugars. A more efficient conversion of starch
translates into process efficiencies in ethanol production. The improved alpha-amylase facilitates this more
efficient starch to ethanol conversion.
59 See generally John M. Urbanchuk, Economic Impact Analysis of Event 3272 Corn on Dry Mill Ethanol
Production, CBI Deleted Copy prepared for Syngenta Biotechology, Inc. (July 2007). The United States ethanol
industry has grown at a tremendous rate, driven by energy security, the high price of foreign oil, the renewable
energy mandates of the Energy Bill of 2005, and the Presidentâ€™s Biofuels Initiative. More than over 100 dry
mill ethanol plants (the majority of capacity) are currently dedicated specifically to the production of ethanol,
with a minimum of an additional 50 planned or under construction. The ethanol industry used an estimated 1.5
billion bushels of corn in 2005 (14% of total corn demand), with ethanol currently representing the third most
important market for US corn, after feed and export uses. This explosive growth in ethanol has created a
significant domestic market for US corn producers. See id.

would require pre-market review or approval by the FDA).
