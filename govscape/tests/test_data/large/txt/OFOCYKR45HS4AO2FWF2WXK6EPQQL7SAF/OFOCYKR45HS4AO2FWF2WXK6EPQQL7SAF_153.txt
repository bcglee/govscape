potential of the AMY797E alpha-amylase.
Syngenta provides data on the in vitro digestibility of AMY797E. Syngenta reports that
AMY797E was susceptible to proteolytic degradation in simulated gastric fluid (SGF)
containing pepsin, indicating that AMY797E is degraded within 5 minutes. Syngenta states
that AMY797E is not stable to digestion and is therefore unlikely to become allergenic.
Syngenta notes that AMY797E is a thermostable protein. In addition, Syngenta reports
that analysis of AMY797E as expressed in corn event 3272 does not reveal evidence of
posttranslational glycosylation.
4.3.2 PMI
Syngenta reports that the donor organism (E. coli) used to develop the PMI protein is
not known to be allergenic.
Syngenta reports that for PMI, there were no amino acid sequence identities of greater than
35% in segments of 80 amino acids with any entries in the database. Syngenta does note that
there was a single segment of 8 contiguous amino acids in the PMI protein that matched a
known allergen, α-parvalbumin from Rana species CH2001, an edible frog. Syngenta reports
that further investigation of PMI using serum from one known α-parvalbumin-sensitive
individual demonstrated a lack of reactivity with PMI. Syngenta therefore concluded that the
sequence identity between PMI and α-parvalbumin is not biologically relevant.
Syngenta provides data on the in vitro digestibility of PMI. Syngenta reports that the PMI
protein was found to be degraded when sampled immediately after time zero. Syngenta
states that PMI is not stable to digestion and is therefore unlikely to become allergenic.
Syngenta notes that the PMI protein is labile to heat. In addition, Syngenta reports that PMI
is unlikely to be glycosylated, given that the PMI protein does not contain consensus amino
acid sequences required for N-glycosylation and the protein is not targeted to a cellular
glycosylation pathway.
4.4 Assessment of Potential Toxicity
4.4.1 AMY797E Alpha-Amylase
Syngenta reported results from an acute oral toxicity study in mice where 1511
milligrams/kilogram body weight (mg/kg bw) AMY797E protein, or a control, was given
by gavage. Syngenta indicates that the AMY797E test substance was prepared from event-
3272 grain and was determined to be 42% AMY797E protein. Syngenta states that the
animals were monitored for 14 days and were sacrificed. Syngenta reports that there were
no effects of treatment on any observation, including body weight, food consumption,
organ weight, or histopathology.
Syngenta reports that the potential toxicity of AMY797E was also assessed by comparing
