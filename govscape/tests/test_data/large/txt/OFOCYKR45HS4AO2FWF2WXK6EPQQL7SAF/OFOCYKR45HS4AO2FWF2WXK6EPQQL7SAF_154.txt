its amino acid sequence against all publicly available protein sequences identified as toxins
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Entrez Protein Database. Syngenta
reports that no significant sequence homology to any known toxins was identified.
4.4.2 PMI
Syngenta reports results from an acute oral toxicity study where PMI protein was given to
mice by gavage at a dose of 3030 mg/kg bw. Syngenta notes that the PMI protein used in
this study was obtained by over-expressing the protein in E. coli. Syngenta states that the
animals were monitored for 14 days and were sacrificed. Syngenta reports that there were no
effects of treatment on any observation, including body weight, food consumption, organ
weight, or histopathology.
Syngenta reports that the potential toxicity of PMI was also assessed comparing its amino
acid sequence against all publicly available protein sequences identified as toxins in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information Entrez Protein Database. Syngenta reports
that no significant sequence homology to any known toxins was identified.
5. Food and Feed Uses of Corn
Syngenta notes that corn grown in the U.S. is primarily the yellow dent type, a commodity
crop used primarily to feed domestic animals, either as grain or forage. The remainder of the
crop being exported or processed by wet or dry milling to yield human food products such as
high fructose corn syrup, starch or oil, grits and flour. The by-products of wet and dry milling
are commonly used in animal feed.
6. Compositional Analysis
Syngenta evaluated the composition of forage and grain from event 3272-derived corn
hybrids relative to negative segregant (near-isogenic) control corn hybrids of similar
genetic background.
Compositional analyses were performed on forage and grain. Syngenta analyzed corn grown
1
at 10 different locations over a two year period, with three replicate plots of each genotype
planted at each location in randomized complete blocks. Grain was harvested from 6
locations
in both years and forage was harvested from 6 locations in 2003 and 7 locations in 2004.
Three of the locations used in 2003 were again used in 2004 for growing corn grain, and
four of the locations used in 2003 were again used for growing corn forage in 2004. Two
2
hybrid pairs
were grown in 2003 and one hybrid pair was grown in 2004. The data were combined for
statistical analysis across locations, hybrid pairs, and growing seasons. Compositional data
were statistically analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance with locations serving
as blocks. Statistical significance was assigned at p < 0.05 indicating that the difference
between the treatments was statistically different at the 5% customary level. Syngenta
