Horizontal gene transfer
Horizontal Gene The transfer of genetic material from one organism (the donor) to
Transfer another organism (the recipient) that is not sexually compatible with
the donor.
Hybrid The offspring of two genetically dissimilar organisms.
Hyperthermophilic organism that thrives in extremely hot environments
(Hyperthermophile)

Industrial Plant A plant genetically engineered with a gene whose effect is primarily of
industrial use, as opposed to an agricultural or nutritional purpose.
Inserted Gene A piece of DNA that has been inserted into an organism using
recombinant DNA technology.
Introgression The introduction of genes from one species into the gene pool of
another via sexual crossing. The process begins with hybridization
between the two species, followed by repeated backcrossing to one of
the parent species.

Kernel dough About 24 to 28 days after silking, the kernel's milky inner fluid is
changing to a 'doughy' consistency as starch accumulation continues in
the endosperm. The shelled cob is now light red or pink. By dough
stage, four embryonic leaves have formed and about half of the mature
kernel dry weight is now in place. Kernel abortion is much less likely
once kernels have reached early dough stage, but severe stress can
continue to affect eventual yield by reducing kernel weight. Kernel
moisture content is approximately 70 percent.

Kernel maturity About 55 to 65 days after silking, kernel dry weight usually reaches its
maximum and kernels are said to be physiologically mature and safe
from frost. Physiological maturity occurs shortly after the kernel milk
line disappears and just before the kernel black layer forms at the tip of
the kernels. Severe stress after physiological maturity has little effect
on grain yield, unless the integrity of the stalk or ear is compromised
(e.g., ECB damage or stalk rots). Kernel moisture content at
physiological maturity averages 30 percent, but can vary from 25 to 40
percent grain moisture.
