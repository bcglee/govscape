Syngenta determined the levels of the following analytes in grain from corn event 3272-
derived and the near-isogenic control hybrids collected at the R6 growth stage (maturity).
The following groups of analytes were measured:
z Proximates
z Minerals
z Amino Acids
z Fatty Acids
z Anti-nutrients
z Secondary metabolites
z Vitamins
A list of specific components contained in each group is shown in Table 2. Syngenta
reported mean values were within published literature ranges, with minor exceptions

noted. , Syngenta conducted a combined statistical analysis of grain data from all field trials
8
for all analytes listed in Table 2, excluding γ-tocopherol and β-cryptoxanthin and the nine
analytes below the limit
of quantitation. Exclusion of these analytes did not, however, affect Syngenta's
conclusions. Low levels of these nutrients and anti-nutrients are consistent with values
reported in the published literature and variable levels of certain nutrients (e.g. selenium)
found in soil throughout the U.S.
Syngenta reported statistically significant differences in mean values between event 3272-
