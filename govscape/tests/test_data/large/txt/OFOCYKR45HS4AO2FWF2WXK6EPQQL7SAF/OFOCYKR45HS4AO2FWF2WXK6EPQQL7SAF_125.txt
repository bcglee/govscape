A recent unreported decision19 from the Northern District of California in Geertson
Seed Farms v. Johanns held that APHIS was required to prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) to support a decision to grant deregulation to a glyphosate-resistant (i.e.,
Round-up Ready) alfalfa product, and rejected the APHIS EA and FONSI as insufficient.20
The court examined the factors of “context” and “intensity” in light of the NEPA goals of
“attaining the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to
health and safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences” and “maintain[ing],
wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual
choice.”21 The court concluded that substantial and unanswered questions existed regarding
gene transmission to non-genetically engineered alfalfa, the development of alfalfa weeds
resistant to herbicides, and increased use of glyphosate.22 The court held that the possibility
that the deregulation of Round-up Ready alfalfa will degrade the human environment by
eliminating a farmer’s choice to grow non-genetically engineered alfalfa and a consumer’s
choice to consume such food is a significant impact that requires an EIS.
By contrast, the Syngenta Event 3272 presents a fundamentally different situation.
Unlike the alfalfa industry, the segmentation and specialization of corn production has
generated a suite of standard industry practices in the U.S. grain marketing system that has
been shown to facilitate coexistence among different varieties and obviate the potential gene
flow consequences posed by alfalfa, as addressed in Geertson. Event 3272 corn is being
released in an environment in which the diversity of corn is closely guarded, and continually
enhanced. This is evident from the commercial channels and identity preservation programs
that have been developed in this modern grain system to manage the co-existence of a variety
of corn products.
