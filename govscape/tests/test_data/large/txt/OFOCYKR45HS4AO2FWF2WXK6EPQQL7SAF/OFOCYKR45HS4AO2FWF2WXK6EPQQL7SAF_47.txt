Threatened and Endangered Species
APHIS evaluated the potential for negative effects on Federal Threatened and Endangered
Species (TES) as listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)
(http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/SpeciesReport.do?dsource=animals,
http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/SpeciesReport.do?dsource=plants, accessed 8/12/08), from cultivation of
Event 3272 corn and its progeny. To identify negative effects or significant impacts on TES
animal species, APHIS evaluated the risks to TES animals from consuming Event 3272 corn.
Risk is a combination of hazard and exposure. APHIS first conducted hazard identification for
Event 3272 corn. APHIS assessed the composition and nutritional quality of Event 3272 corn,
and compared the composition of Event 3272 to the composition of a non-genetically engineered
control corn line and the natural variation in found commercial corn varieties. Corn is a feed
common for many livestock and wildlife (e.g., birds, deer, and rodents). If the composition of
Event 3272 corn is similar to other commercial corn plants, it is unlikely that Event 3272 poses a
hazard to TES animal species. If no hazards are identified, then the risk Event 3272 corn
harming TES animal species is also unlikely, regardless of exposure. However, APHIS also
assessed the exposure data presented by Syngenta to further elucidate the exposure posed by
Event 3272 corn to TES animals.
Event 3272 corn is genetically engineered to produce a thermostable alpha-amylase. Alpha-
amylases are ubiquitous in the environment, being naturally present in microorganisms, plants
and animals (Janeček et al. 1999). These enzymes play a key role in many cellular metabolic
processes by catalyzing the breakdown of starch, such as in germinating seed of cereal plants
(Yu et al. 1996) or in the microbial decomposition of organic matter to provide carbon and
energy for microbial growth processes (Rothstein et al. 1986). Many types of commercial food
processing, feed ingredient applications, and industrial applications also utilize alpha-amylase
enzymes, including the production of fuel and potable alcohol (brewing, distillation processes),
and corn syrups (Janeček et al. 1999, Lévêque et al. 2000, Pariza and Johnson 2001, Olempska-
Beer et al. 2006).
The data presented in the petition suggests there is no difference in compositional and nutritional
quality of Event 3272 corn compared to conventional corn, apart from the presence of
AMY797E and PMI. Although some of the variables measured by the applicant showed
statistically significant differences between Event 3272 corn and the nontransgenic hybrid
controls (Tables 6-1 to 6-6, pages 70-76), none of the values for the forage and grain
composition characteristics were outside the range of natural variability of conventional corn as
found in the International Life Sciences Institute Crop Composition Database (OECD 2003,
Ridley et al. 2004, ILSI 2006) or in the OECD consensus document on corn (OECD 2003)
composition. Event 3272 corn does not express additional proteins, natural toxicants,
allelochemicals, pheromones, hormones, etc. that could directly or indirectly affect a listed TES
or species proposed for listing. Thus, the composition of Event 3272 is not biologically different
than conventional corn.
Given that the composition of Event 3272 corn was found to be consistent with the natural
variation found in conventional corn varieties, the applicant conducted studies to confirm the
absence of deleterious effects for animals when feeding on Event 3272 corn. AMY797E is
predominantly found in the corn kernels of Event 3272 plants (1627 µg/g fresh weight in the
dough stage), with minute amounts found in the roots during the whole stage (<0.1 µg/g fresh
