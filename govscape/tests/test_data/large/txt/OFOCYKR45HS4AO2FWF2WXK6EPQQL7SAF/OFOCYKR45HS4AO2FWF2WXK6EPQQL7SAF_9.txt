II. Affected Environment
CORN PRODUCTION
Corn (Zea mays L.), otherwise known as maize, is the world's most widely grown cereal,
reflecting its ability to adapt to a wide range of production environments (Morris 1998). Corn is
an annual plant typically grown in zones of abundant rainfall and fertile soils (Morris 1998). In
the U.S., corn is grown in temperate regions due to the moisture level and number of frost-free
days required to reach maturity. Corn varieties having a relative maturity of 100 to 115 days are
typically grown in the U.S. corn belt, which includes Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio â€”
approximately 50% of all corn grown in the U.S. is from these four states. The Corn Belt also
includes parts of South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri,
and Kentucky.
Conventional Farming
Conventional farming includes any farming system where synthetic pesticides or fertilizers may
be used. The definition of conventional farming usually includes the use of genetically
engineered (GE) varieties, but this document will consider the impacts of Event 3272 corn, a GE
corn variety, separately and in comparison to the use of conventional corn varieties in
conventional farming systems. Conventional farming covers a broad scope of farming practices,
ranging from farmers who only occasionally use synthetic pesticides and fertilizers to those
farmers whose harvest depends on regular pesticide and fertilizer inputs.
United States corn production for 2007, including production of conventional and genetically
engineered corn varieties, was 13.1 billion bushels from 86.5 million harvested acres (USDA-
NASS 2007a). In 2008, growers expect to harvest 78.9 million acres for grain, down 9 percent
from 2007. Of the total corn acres planted in 2008, 80% were GE corn varieties (USDA-NASS
2008a) up from 73% in 2007 (USDA-NASS 2007a), and 61% in 2006 (USDA-NASS 2006).
Over 3 billion bushels of corn grain, which includes both GE and non-GE varieties, were used
for ethanol production in 2007 (Trostle 2008, USDA-ERS 2008b), which corresponds to over
20% of U.S. corn production.
Agronomic Practices
Today, growers can choose from hundreds of corn hybrids marketed by companies that produce
seed (refer to Appendix A for examples of available GE varieties). Hybrids differ generally in
agronomic characteristics, including disease and pest resistance and length of growing period
(Olson and Sander 1988). The optimum planting date for corn is influenced by factors such as
the locality, environmental conditions, seed growing period, and seed variety, and it usually
occurs in April or May. Harvesting generally occurs from mid-to-late September through
November; the use of a combine (mechanical harvesting) is the standard practice for grain
production.
Crop rotations (successive planting of different crops on the same land) are used to optimize soil
nutrition and fertility, and reduce pathogen loads. Crops used in rotation with corn vary
regionally, but there has been an increase in the number of fields that have a corn-to-corn
rotation, as opposed to rotation to another crop besides corn (Erickson and Lowenberg-DeBoer
2005). The increase in corn-to-corn rotations has been attributed to the increase in corn prices
due to higher demand, mainly for ethanol production (Hart 2006, Stockton et al. 2007). In some
areas, the corn-to-corn rotation causes increased levels of fertilizer inputs (Sawyer 2007). Insect
