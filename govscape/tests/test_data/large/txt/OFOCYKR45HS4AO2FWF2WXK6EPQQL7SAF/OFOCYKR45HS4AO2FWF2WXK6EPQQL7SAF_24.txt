The corn-growing counties within the 26 states that have a corn ethanol plant or one under
construction are listed in Appendix B. These 1826 counties in 26 states will be included in the
environmental effects analysis for the alternatives. California counties of Marin, Mendocino,
Santa Cruz, and Trinity have all passed legislation banning the use of genetically engineered
crops. These counties will not be included in the environmental analyses, as Event 3272 corn
will not be grown in these counties.
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
One of APHIS’ missions is to improve American agricultural productivity. Best management
practices, such as planting dates, seeding rates, and harvest times are commonly accepted,
practical ways to grow corn, regardless if the corn farmer is using conventional systems, organic
practices, or using genetically engineered varieties. These well-established, widely-practiced
means to produce corn can be obtained through local Cooperative Extension Service offices and
their respective websites. (A summary website can be found at
www.ipmcenters.org/cropprofiles/index.cfm, accessed 4/24/2008).
PRODUCT CONTROLS
It is Syngenta’s intention that Event 3272 corn will be marketed and produced in a manner
similar to other value-added, specialty corn products, such as popcorn, waxy (high amylopectin)
corn, high oil corn, high protein and modified protein corn, sweet corn, Indian corn, higher
fermentable corn, white corn, blue corn, and high amylase corn (USGC 2006). As discussed
above, production of these value-added products are typically produced with identity
preservation systems that include contracts between all handlers of the grain (seed suppliers,
farmers, handlers, and processors), traceability, product tracking, process verification and
separate channeling to minimize commingling.
USE OF CLOSE-LOOPED SYSTEM
Another level of potential control involves utilizing a ‘closed-loop’ system for specialty grain
production. The closed-loop system is a more restrictive system to provide more control over the
specialty crop to better protect its value. Syngenta anticipates that Event 3272 corn will be
commercialized with the use of contracts and other control mechanisms to establish a ‘closed-
loop’ system for Event 3272 corn. This closed loop system has three principle points of contact;
the producer of Event 3272 corn (Syngenta), the grower of Event 3272 corn, and the end-user of
Event 3272 corn, the ethanol plant. According to Syngenta (see Appendix G), each point of
contact has specific roles and responsibilities:
