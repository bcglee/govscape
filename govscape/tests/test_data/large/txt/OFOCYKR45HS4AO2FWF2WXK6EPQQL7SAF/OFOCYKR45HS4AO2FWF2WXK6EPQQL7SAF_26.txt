PRODUCTION PRACTICES
APHIS also recognizes that producers of non-GE corn, particularly producers who sell their
products to markets sensitive to genetically engineered traits (e.g. organic or some export
markets) can be reasonably assumed to be using practices on their farm to protect their crop from
unwanted substances and maintain their price premium. For example, the National Organic
Program (NOP) has recognized the practicality of protecting organically-produced crops, and the
investment farmers put into their production practices, by requiring that organic production plans
include methods to protect organically-produced crops.
“Organic crops must be protected from contamination by prohibited
substances used on adjoining lands (for example, drifting pesticides,
fertilizer-laden runoff water, and pollen drift from genetically
engineered…)” (NCAT 2003).
Typically, more than one method is under organic practices to prevent unwanted material from
entering their fields including; isolation of the farm, physical barriers or buffer zones between
organic production and non-organic production, as well as formal communications between
neighboring farms (NCAT 2003). The organic plan used as the basis for organic certification
should include a description of practices used to prevent or reduce the likelihood of unwanted
substances, like GE pollen or seed, at each step in the farming operation, such as planting,
harvesting, storing and transporting the crop (Riddle 2004, Krueger 2007, Kuepper et al. 2007).
Organic plans should also include of how the risk of GE pollen or seed co-mingling will be
monitored (Kuepper et al. 2007). Farmers using organic methods are requested to let
neighboring farmers know that they are using organic production practices and request that the
neighbors also help the organic farmer reduce contamination events (NCAT 2003, Krueger
2007). Thus, commonly used production practices for corn, and the practical methods typically
used by corn farmers using organic methods to protect their crop and maximize their profits and
price premiums granted to corn under organic production, currently provide many measures that
greatly reduce the likelihood of accidental gene flow between Event 3272 corn and non-GE corn
fields. APHIS will use the assumption that farmers are already using, or have the ability to use,
these common, reasonable practices as its baseline for the analyses of the following alternatives
below. Recommended organic production practices for field corn are also readily available
(Kuepper 2002).
OTHER ASSUMPTIONS
Thus the environmental consequences of the different alternatives described above will be
analyzed under the assumption that farmers who produce conventional corn, Event 3272 corn, or
produce corn using organic methods, are using reasonable, commonly accepted best management
practices for their chosen system and varieties during agricultural corn production. However,
APHIS recognizes that not all farmers follow these best management practices for corn. Thus,
the analyses of the environmental affects will also include the assumption that some farmers do
not follow these best management practices.
OTHER INFORMATION
Syngenta provided APHIS a series of reports detailing the potential benefits and impacts of
Event 3272 corn in terms of ethanol production and byproducts, corn processing, and pollen
movement in corn. These are referenced in the EA and the CBI-deleted versions are found as
Appendices to this EA.
