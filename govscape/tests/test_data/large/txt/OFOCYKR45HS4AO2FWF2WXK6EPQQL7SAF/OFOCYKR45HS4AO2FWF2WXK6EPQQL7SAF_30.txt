The baseline effects of pesticides, and levels applied during the agricultural production of corn
will not change due to granting nonregulated status of Event 3272 corn. Granting nonregulated
status to Event 3272 corn does not cause additional or synergistic effects of pesticide use because
there is no change in pesticide use or effects compared to the current conventional production of
corn.
Organic Farming
Coexistence
No Action: Coexistence
GE corn has been in production since the mid-1990’s, and in 2008 accounted for 80% of the 87.3
million acres of corn planted (USDA-NASS 2008a). During this time, corn production for GE-
sensitive markets has increased; for example organic corn production increased 35% between
2001 and 2005 (USGC 2006), at the same time that corn acreage using GE varieties increased
from 26% of corn acreage to 52% of corn acreage (USDA-NASS 2001, 2005). The amount of
GE corn planted in conventional and organic production systems in the U.S. is increasing, and
both production practices will likely continue to increase without granting nonregulated status to
Event 3272 under the “no action” alternative. Coexistence measures as discussed in the
Methodology and Assumptions section above are expected to continue. Currently available seed
for conventional and GE corn varieties, and those corn varieties that are developed for organic
production, will remain the same under the “no action” alternative.
Preferred Alternative: Coexistence
Corn produced using organic methods is increasing at approximately 30% a year (USGC 2006),
even though there are no national requirements that GE corn varieties currently in production use
mandated techniques for isolation between fields containing GE corn and those fields using
organic production practices. In the Methodology and Assumptions section above, the
discussion contains information related to the requirements for farmers using organic production
methods under the National Organic Program. Conventional farmers growing GE varieties
typically use traditional production practices, and have no requirements related to isolating
pollen movement between their fields and their neighbor’s. Without any requirements in place,
the production of corn using organic method is continuing to increase.
In agricultural systems, growers may choose to grow GE or non-GE corn, and obtain price
premiums for growing varieties of corn for particular markets (e.g., using organic methods for
corn production or producing a specialty corn variety for particular processing needs). For
example, in 2007, conventional corn averaged $4.00/bushel (USDA-NASS 2008b), whereas
organic corn averaged $10.00/bushel (Alexander 2007). USDA asserts that agricultural practices
that use conventional means, organic production systems, or genetically engineered varieties can
all provide benefits to the environment, consumers, and farm income. As discussed in Section II
and below under the section for “Gene Movement,” gene flow into and out of these specialized
corn production systems has been managed using various types of buffer zones or isolation
practices, such as differences in planting (which results in differences in flowering) or making
sure fields are distance from other compatible crops (such as using isolation distances).
As discussed in the Methodology and Assumption methods, Syngenta has included some
mandatory measures in their Stewardship Agreement that would facilitate coexistence, including
measures to minimize pollen movement outside corn fields containing Event 3272 corn (see
