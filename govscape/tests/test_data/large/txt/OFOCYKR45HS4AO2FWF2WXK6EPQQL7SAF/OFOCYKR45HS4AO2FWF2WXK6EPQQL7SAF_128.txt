A major feature in a traceable supply chain is the ability to trace-back or trace-forward and
track the physical location of the product in the overall supply chain.33
Commercial contracts provide another important tool for product differentiation in the
modern grain system. Contracts for identity preserved grains govern relations and establish
stewardship controls between farmers and seed suppliers, handlers, intermediary firms, and
processors. These contracts are typically uniform and establish terms for specific variety,
delivery time, delivery place, dedicated storage, and quality control.34
C. Private Market Initiatives
To retain their competitive advantage in the global market and to address domestic
food safety and quality issues, U.S. grain producers and handlers have relied on the contract
and traceability tools described above to implement methods to produce, handle, and market
trait specific grains, including documentation systems that trace raw materials back to the
farm. Traceability and documentation are considered core competencies for grain
operations.35
These competencies are especially well developed for value-added grains or specialty
corn products. These value-added products are produced in large volumes and are segregated
by channeling.36 Segregation by channeling flows from the farm to the transporting truck to
the grain elevator and commingling is minimized by running equipment empty before
switching varieties or designating certain days of the week or alternate sites for receiving and
shipping these specialty crops.37 Crops handled by this method include a variety of value-
added crops, such as white, waxy, yellow food-grade, high-oil, non-GM corn, and durum
wheat grown in the Southwest.38
