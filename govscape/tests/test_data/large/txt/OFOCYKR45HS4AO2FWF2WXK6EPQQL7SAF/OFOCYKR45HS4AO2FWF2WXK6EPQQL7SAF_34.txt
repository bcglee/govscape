endangered species (section on Animals and Threatened and Endangered Species), and those
analyses are based on the comparison of the GE-corn to its non-GE counterpart. Other countries
have also found Event 3272 corn safe for food and feed, including Canada (2008), Australia
(2008), and the Philippines (2008).
In 2006, South Africa denied Syngenta’s submission for Event 3272 corn’s use for food and
feed. It is unclear exactly the reasons for the South African denial of Syngenta’s initial
submission regarding Event 3272 corn. However, concerns regarding the allergenicity of Event
3272 corn were raised by opponents of genetic engineering (Freese and Mayet 2006). The
comments centered around two components: 1) allergenicity of fungal-derived alpha-amylases
and 2) thermostability of alpha-amylases.
Fungal-derived alpha-amylases are one of the occupational allergens in the bakery industry
(Houba et al. 1996, Houba et al. 1997). Syngenta assessed the potential allergenicity of the
AMY797E alpha-amylase and PMI proteins by searching for amino acid homology between
these proteins and known allergen protein sequences. These searches were conducted using a
database comprised of identified or putative allergen sequences from publicly available
databases (GenPept, PIR, SWISS-PROT, FAARP and IUIS) and additional putative allergen
sequences from the scientific literature. Syngenta reported that for alpha-amylase in Event 3272
corn, there were no significant similarities between the alpha-amylase found in Event 3272 corn
and other allergens. There was one small section of the enzyme that corresponded with an
allergen from an insect (American cockroach), but Syngenta maintains that this sequence identity
is not biologically relevant and has no implication for the allergenic potential of the AMY797E
alpha-amylase. AMY797E is a thermostable protein, which may be a consideration of what
compounds are allergenic (Sampson 1999, Taylor and Hefle 2001). However Syngenta
conducted digestibility experiments and found that AMY797E is not stable to digestion
(Appendix H), and thus concluded that the AMY797E is unlikely to become allergenic. The
FDA did not question the conclusion that AMY797E and PMI are not likely to become
allergenic (Appendix H). APHIS has concluded that these studies are sufficient and agrees with
the findings of the FDA.
Based on the assessment of laboratory data provided by Syngenta and scientific literature
[Section E for review, (USDA-APHIS 2008)], along with the completion of the consultation
process with FDA regarding Event 3272 corn (Appendix H), and consideration that other
countries have also found Event 3272 safe for food and feed use (Australia, Canada, and the
Phillipines), APHIS has concluded that under this alternative, the proposed action to grant
nonregulated status to Event 3272 corn would have no significant impacts on human or animal
health.
Cumulative Effects: Human Health
There are no significant impacts on human or animal health related to granting nonregulated
status to Event 3272 corn, and no cumulative effects have been identified.
Worker Safety
No Action: Worker Safety
During agricultural production of corn, farmers may be exposed to pesticides during application
of these chemicals to crops. Under the “no action” alternative, exposure to these agricultural
chemicals during corn production would remain the same.
