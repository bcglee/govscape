program, Excellence Through Stewardship: Advancing Best Practices in Agricultural
Biotechnology, the first industry-coordinated effort to address product stewardship and
quality management.40 This industry stewardship program is described in the Quality
Management Program Guide to Maintaining Plant Product Integrity.41 The guide is for
member companies and others involved in agricultural biotechnology research and
development to use in understanding and implementing their own best practices. The Guide
provides detailed guidance on how to develop and implement a quality management program
that will assist product developers in maintaining plant product integrity from discovery to
commercialization and post-market activities. It includes a series of comprehensive and
informative educational modules that can be adapted to the specific activities pertinent to the
user’s own operations, including incorporation into existing quality management systems.
Common to all of the modules is an emphasis on the importance of product identification and
traceability.42
Syngenta supports the new BIO stewardship program. As a company, Syngenta has
adopted the following best practices and quality management principles to serve as a guide
when it launches new products:
• Syngenta will conduct market and trade assessments to identify key
import markets for all of its biotech products prior to product
commercialization.
• For each biotech product, at the time U.S. submissions are completed,
Syngenta will begin to consult with the major, relevant trade and value
chain stakeholders on detailed plans for pre-commercial activities, and
full-scale commercialization.
• Syngenta will meet all necessary regulatory requirements in key
exporting countries (where the seed will be commercialized) and
importing countries that have functioning regulatory systems, which
currently include the United States, Canada and Japan, prior to
commercialization, unless determined otherwise in consultation with
