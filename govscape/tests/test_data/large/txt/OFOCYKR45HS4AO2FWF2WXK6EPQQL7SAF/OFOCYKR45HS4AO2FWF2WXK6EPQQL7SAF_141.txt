To the extent adventitious pollination result in corn amylase entering the yellow dent
corn commodity supply, it will be limited to 0.1% of the grown corn amylase. As discussed
above, these minute quantities will present no food safety issues and will not affect the
suitability of yellow dent commodity corn for corn processing. This 0.1% will be diluted at
least 5 times, and possibly up to 50 times, with non-amylase yellow dent corn prior to
entering masa production. This is far below the 0.1% at which corn amylase begins to affect
masa production. Moreover, as affirmed by APHIS, it will not become a seed production
issue given the sophistication of current seed production techniques, isolation distances, and
the like.
Accordingly, this effect is not significant in either context or intensity.
2. Potential Effects of Plants on the Soil
There is no suggestion in the scientific evidence presented in support of Syngentaâ€™s
petition to deregulate or in the literature that Event 3272 corn would have any effect on the
soil.76 What the record does show is that alpha amylases are ubiquitous in the environment
and are safe. They are naturally present in microorganisms, plants (including corn), and
animals. The FDA food safety consultation process indicates that the Event 3272 corn
presents no different issues for toxicity or allergenicity.77
Accordingly, this effect is not significant in either context or intensity.
3. Impacts on Human Health
As discussed above, the successful conclusion of the FDA food safety consultation
demonstrates that there are no effects of concern for human health.78 Accordingly, this effect
is not significant in either context or intensity.
4. Functionality of Event 3272 for Production of Processed Corn
Products
The suitability of a new specialty corn biotechnology event for use in markets for
which it is not intended has not been identified by APHIS as a factor considered to be a
