conventional varieties or other GE varieties as determined by the applicant or developer.
Syngenta currently has 3 GE corn varieties that may be stacked1 with Event 3272 corn: two
varieties that have an insect-resistance trait (Bt11 and Mir604) and one variety an herbicide-
tolerance trait (GA21). These corn lines (Bt11, MIR604, and GA21) have all been granted non-
regulated status, and the environmental assessments conducted by APHIS for each of these
products can be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/not_reg.html. Syngenta has submitted a
petition for nonregulated status for another insect resistant corn variety, Mir162 (petition 07-253-
01p), and it is possible that Event 3272 corn may be stacked with Mir162, if Mir162 is
determined to be unlikely to pose a plant pest risk.
NEED FOR APHIS ACTION
Under the authority of 7 CFR part 340, APHIS has the responsibility for the safe development
and use of genetically engineered organisms under the provisions of the Plant Protection Act.
APHIS must respond to petitioners that request a determination of the regulated status of
genetically engineered organisms, including genetically engineered crop plants such as Event
3272 corn. If a petition for nonregulated status is submitted, APHIS must make a determination
if the genetically engineered organism is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk.
As a Federal agency subject to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), APHIS has prepared this environmental assessment (EA) to consider
the potential environmental effects of this proposed action (granting nonregulated status) and the
reasonable alternatives to that action consistent with NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-
1508, 7 CFR 1b, and 7 CFR part 372). This EA has been prepared in order to specifically
evaluate the effects on the quality of the human environment2 that may result from the
deregulation of Event 3272 corn.
OTHER REGULATORY APPROVALS
Event 3272 corn has successfully completed the consultation process with the FDA concerning
the food and feed safety (Appendix H). Event 3272 corn does not contain any genetically
engineered pesticides or tolerance to herbicides; thus EPA consultation is not required for this
product. There are no other Federal, state, or local permits that are needed prior to the
implementation of this action. A list of the current status of U.S. and international approvals is
found in Table 1.

1 Two or more traits (e.g. herbicide tolerance and insect resistance) in one plant.
2 Under NEPA regulations, the “human environment” includes “the natural and physical environment and the
relationship of people with the environment” (40 CFR § 1508.14).
