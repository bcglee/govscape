Additional identity-preservation controls are found in what is commonly referred to
as a “closed-loop system.” This system is used to preserve the identity of value-added grain
products, such as high-amylose corn. As noted by the Economic Research Service (ERS) for
the USDA, a closed-loop delivery system has distinct advantages over segregation by
channeling:
A closed-loop system provides more controls than mere
channeling, and better protects the value of a specialty crop
such as high-sucrose soybeans, high-oleic soybeans, or high-
amylose corn. Production occurs almost exclusively under a
contract between the grower and end-user. Typically, these
production contracts mandate delivery of all production to a
specified location, and require midseason inspections and
return of all unused seed to the seed company. Third-party
auditors also verify that the system is in fact a closed loop and
that all requirements have been adhered to throughout the
system.39
This closed-loop system for the delivery of value-added, specialized corn or grain
product clearly contrasts with the marketing of commodity corn, primarily yellow dent corn.
Commodity corn is used for animal feed and is processed by wet and dry milling industries
for numerous and diverse food and industrial products, including ethanol. Specialty corn, on
the other hand, especially in the closed-loop system, is handled differently than commodity
corn throughout the supply chain – from seed production to grain handling – in order to
ensure that a sufficient quantity of high quality corn is produced and delivered to the end-
user for its particular use. This control also helps to ensure that the specialty corn is not used
in unsuitable applications, which could result in process breakdowns or products with altered
or undesired characteristics.
D. Supplemental Mechanisms, Standards, and Recordkeeping Requirements
In addition to private initiatives, a variety of supporting mechanisms, standards, and
legal requirements support product identification and the management of coexistence in the
U.S. grain system today.
