Subject: Biotechnology Notification File (BNF) 000095, corn transformation event
3272.

1. Introduction
In a submission dated August 31, 2005, Syngenta Seeds, Inc. (Syngenta) provided
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a safety and nutritional assessment of
genetically engineered AMY797E alpha-amylase corn designated as corn event
3272. Syngenta provided additional information to the FDA on May 1, 2006,
August 2, 2006, November 8, 2006, January 19, 2007, March 2, 2007, March 6,
2007, March 7, 2007, May 31, 2007, July 11, 2007 and July 12, 2007. Syngenta
concluded that food and feed derived from corn event 3272 are as safe and
nutritious as food and feed derived from conventional corn varieties.
2. Intended Effect
Corn event 3272 was genetically engineered to contain a chimeric, thermostable,
alpha-amylase gene derived from alpha-amylase genes from three hyperthermophilic
microorganisms within the order Thermococcales. The resulting transformed corn is
intended to be mixed with other corn for use in dry grind fuel ethanol production as
a source of alpha-amylase, replacing the need for the addition of microbially-
