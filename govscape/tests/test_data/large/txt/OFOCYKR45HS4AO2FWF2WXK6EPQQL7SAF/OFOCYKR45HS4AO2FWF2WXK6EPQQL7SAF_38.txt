Best management guidelines for Event 3272 corn (Appendix D and Appendix G) require the use
of 12 border rows of non-Event 3272 corn to reduce the likelihood of gene movement between
Event 3272 corn and other corn fields. The border rows of non-Event 3272 corn are used as a
‘pollen trap.’ Corn pollen is heavy and does not travel far from the corn field (Sanvido et al.
2008). When pollen does move from Event 3272 corn, the border rows of corn will ‘catch’ the
pollen in a ‘trap,’ and prevent the movement of pollen, and subsequently genes, outside of the
field of Event 3272 corn. Additionally, Event 3272 corn is being grown as a specialty corn crop,
and thus maintaining the purity of this corn variety is also important. Thus, to a lesser degree,
the border rows also act as a ‘pollen trap’ to prevent other corn pollen from entering the field of
Event 3272 corn. The use of border rows may result in a reduction of up to more than 99.9% of
Event 3272 corn pollen leaving the corn field (Appendix D).
In agricultural systems, growers may choose to grow GE or non-GE corn, and obtain price
premiums for growing these varieties of corn for particular markets (e.g., using organic methods
for corn production or producing a specialty corn variety for particular processing needs). For
example, in 2007, conventional corn averaged $4.00/bushel (USDA-NASS 2008b), whereas
organic corn averaged $10.00/bushel (Alexander 2007). USDA asserts that agricultural practices
that use conventional means, organic production systems, or genetically engineered varieties can
all provide benefits to the environment, consumers, and farm income. Gene movement into and
out of these specialized corn production systems have been managed using various types of
buffer zones or isolation practices, such as differences in planting (which results in differences in
flowering) or making sure fields are distance from other compatible crops (such as using
isolation distances).
For example, besides the typical identity preservation and closed loop systems in place for
specialty crops, those farmers using organic production also put in place measures to maintain
purity for their crops. Typically, more than one method is used by farmers using organic
methods to prevent unwanted material from entering their fields including; isolation of the farm,
physical barriers or buffer zones between organic production and non-organic production, as
well as formal communications between neighboring farms (NCAT 2003). The plan used as the
basis for organic certification should include a description of practices used to prevent or reduce
the likelihood of unwanted substances, like GE pollen or seed, at each step in the farming
operation, such as planting, harvesting, storing and transporting the crop (Riddle 2004, Krueger
2007, Kuepper et al. 2007). Plans for organic systems also should include of how the risk of
GMO contamination will be monitored (Kuepper et al. 2007). Farmers using organic methods
are requested to let neighboring farmers know that they are using organic production practices
and request that the neighbors also help the farmer reduce contamination events (NCAT 2003,
Krueger 2007). Thus, commonly used production practices for corn and the practical methods
typically used by corn farmers who use organic methods to protect their crop and maximize their
profits and premiums granted to corn produced using approved plans currently provide many
measures that greatly reduce the likelihood of accidental gene flow between Event 3272 corn and
non-GE corn fields.
As more and more corn acreage is using GE varieties, corn production for GE-sensitive markets
has increased; for example corn produced using organic methods increased 35% between 2001
and 2005 (USGC 2006), at the same time that corn acreage using GE varieties increased by 50%
(USDA-NASS 2001, 2005). During this time, there was no mandated use of separation distance
or other measures to minimize gene movement between corn fields, except for those measures
