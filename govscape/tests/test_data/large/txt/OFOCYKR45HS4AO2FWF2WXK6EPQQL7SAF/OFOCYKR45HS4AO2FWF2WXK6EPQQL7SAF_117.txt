Event 3272 Corn and Food Processing
Event 3272 corn expresses the thermostable AMY797E alpha-amylase in the endosperm of
the grain. This enzyme hydrolyzes starch to sugar during the liquefaction phase of dry grind
ethanol production. As presented in Syngenta’s petition 05-280-01p, the compositional
analysis of Event 3272 corn demonstrated it is not materially different from commercial corn
hybrids. Although the presence of this alpha-amylase may have an impact on certain
processed corn products due to the conversion of starch to dextrins and sugars during
processing, neither the starch itself nor any other nutritional component of Event 3272 corn
has been altered by the genetic modification. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Syngenta’s
concluded consultation with the FDA (BNF 0095), there is no food safety issue associated
with the possible presence of the AMY797E alpha-amylase enzyme in foods.
While beneficial for ethanol production, the activity of AMY797E alpha-amylase may either
have no effect or potentially may have desirable or undesirable effects on certain types of
processed corn food products. AMY797E alpha-amylase is not able to act on the starch in
the intact kernel. However, during or after processing with the addition of water and heat,
enzyme activity could result in the conversion of some starch to dextrins and sugars. It is this
potential for alpha-amylase starch hydrolyzing activity, during or after processing, that may
impact properties of the corn or its components used in food.
However, the quality and properties of processed corn (e.g. dough handling characteristics)
and finished processed food products (e.g. corn chips) are dependent on many factors. These
include the characteristics and condition of the raw corn as well as specific process variables
such as, cooking time, temperature, type of equipment, degree of grinding (particle size),
moisture content and baking time. Furthermore, commercial hybrid seed companies have
specifically developed corn hybrids with improved properties desirable by the food industry,
e.g. (white, waxy, hard endosperm, high oil, low temperature dried, high extractable starch,
etc.) that have good yield and are adapted across regions of the U.S. corn belt. These hybrids
are specified by buyers and end-users of corn for production and premiums are paid for
growing, delivering, and meeting and maintaining the purity and quality standards of the
corn. In addition to grain sourcing, a number of additional measures are employed
throughout the food process including inspection and grading of the corn, cooking the corn,
formulation and testing of the final food product. These commonly employed quality control
measures ensure that corn food products are acceptable to consumers.
