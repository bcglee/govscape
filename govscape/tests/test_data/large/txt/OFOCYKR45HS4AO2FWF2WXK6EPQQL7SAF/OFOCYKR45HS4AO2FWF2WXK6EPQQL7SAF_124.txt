considerations of both context and intensity.15 The term “context” refers to the setting
within which the proposed action takes place.16 In considering context, an agency must look
at the significance of an action “analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole
(human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality.”17 The term
“intensity” refers to “the severity of the impact.”18

18 Id. With regard to the intensity element of the “significance” determination, the Council on Environmental
Quality (CEQ) regulations provide the following ten (10) factors to guide the analysis:
(1) Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant effect may exist even if the Federal agency
believes that on balance the effect will be beneficial.
(2) The degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety.
(3) Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands,
prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas.
(4) The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly
controversial.
(5) The degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique
or unknown risks.
(6) The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects or
represents a decision in principle about a future consideration.
(7) Whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant
impacts. Significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the
environment. Significance cannot be avoided by terming an action temporary or by breaking it down into small
component parts.
(8) The degree to which the action may adversely affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in
or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause loss or destruction of significant
scientific, cultural, or historical resources.
(9) The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat that
has been determined to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
(10) Whether the action threatens a violation of Federal, State, or local law or requirements imposed for the
protection of the environment.
