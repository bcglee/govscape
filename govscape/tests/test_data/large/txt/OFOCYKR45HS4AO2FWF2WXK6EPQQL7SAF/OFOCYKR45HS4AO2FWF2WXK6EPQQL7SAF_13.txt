parts of the grain. Water is added to the meal to create a slurry. Microbial enzymes
(alpha-amylase) are added to the slurry to start the conversion of starch to dextrose.
2. Liquefaction. The slurry is processed in a high-temperature cooker to reduce bacteria
levels ahead of fermentation. Jet cookers inject steam into the corn flour slurry and cook
it at temperatures above 100°C. The cooked slurry, now called mash, is allowed to cool,
additional microbial alpha-amylase is added, and liquefying continues. Sulfuric acid is
typically added to maintain pH.
3. Saccharification. The mash is further cooled after liquefaction and a second microbial
enzyme (glucoamylase) is added. This enzyme completes the breakdown of the starch
into glucose, a simple sugar. This step often occurs as the mash is transferred to
fermenters and continues throughout the next step.
4. Fermentation. Yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol and carbon dioxide
(CO ) begins. Ammonia is added for pH control and as a nutrient to the yeast. The
2
fermentation process generally takes about 40 to 50 hours. During this part of the process,
the mash is agitated and kept cool to facilitate the activity of the yeast. The CO released
2
during fermentation is either released into the atmosphere or captured and sold for use in
carbonating soft drinks and beverages and the manufacture of dry ice.
5. Distillation and recovery. After fermentation, the resulting "beer" is transferred to
distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining "stillage." The
ethanol is concentrated to 190 proof using conventional distillation and then is
dehydrated to approximately 200 proof in a molecular sieve system. The ethanol product
is then blended with about 5% denaturant (such as natural gasoline) to render it
undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. It is then ready for shipment to
gasoline terminals or retailers. The stillage is centrifuged into liquid (thin stillage) and
solid (distillers’ grains) fragments. Some of the thin stillage is recycled to the beginning
of the dry-grind process to conserve the water used by the facility. The rest of the thin
stillage passes through evaporators to remove a significant portion of the water to
produce thickened syrup. Usually, the syrup is blended with the distillers’ grains to
produce distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS), a high quality and nutritious livestock
feed. When markets for the feed product are close the plant, the byproduct may be sold
without drying as distillers’ grains or wet distillers’ grains. DDGS in wet form is prone to
deterioration, especially in warmer weather; consequently, the use of wet DDGS is
limited to producers located close to drygrind plants (Rausch and Belyea 2006).
PUBLIC HEALTH
Public health concerns surrounding field corn, like Event 3272 corn and the resultant ethanol co-
product of DDGS, focus primarily on human and animal consumption. Non-GE corn varieties,
both those developed for conventional use and for use in organic production systems, are not
routinely required to be evaluated by any regulatory agency in the U.S. for food or feed safety
prior to release in the market. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), it is
the responsibility of food and feed manufacturers to ensure that the products they market are safe
and properly labeled. Food and feed derived from Event 3272 corn must be in compliance with
all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
