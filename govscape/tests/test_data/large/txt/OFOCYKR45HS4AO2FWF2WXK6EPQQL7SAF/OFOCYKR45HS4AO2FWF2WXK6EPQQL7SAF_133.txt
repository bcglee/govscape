4. USDA Initiatives
The mission of the USDA GIPSA is to facilitate the marketing of grains, oilseeds,
and related agricultural commodities.53 The process Verification Program offered by GIPSA ensures
traceability and managing risk to settle disputes. GIPSA recently implemented a Proficiency
Program to evaluate the performance of laboratories that test cereals, oilseeds, and feed ingredients

reports.55
