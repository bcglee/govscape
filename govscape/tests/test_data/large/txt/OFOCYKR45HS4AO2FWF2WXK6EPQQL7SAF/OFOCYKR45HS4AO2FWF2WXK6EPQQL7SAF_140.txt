1. Potential Changes in Weediness and Invasiveness
Event 3272 contains an added alpha-amylase enzyme that facilitates ethanol
production. This creates a valuable output trait – better suiting this specialty corn to the
production of ethanol in the dry grind process – but it does nothing to make it a better
competitor vis-à-vis other corn. Accordingly, it presents none of the weediness and
invasiveness concerns associated with plant-incorporated protectants that provide resistance
to pests or herbicides.
Event 3272 does present the same gene flow potential between itself and other corn
varieties that is acknowledged as a scientific reality in the draft EIS.72 This is not a concern
respecting gene flow between corn and other species. As noted in the environmental
assessment supporting the deregulation of MIR604 (corn rootworm), corn does not have
weedy relatives with which it outcrosses in the United States.73 With respect to the impact of
gene flow between different varieties of corn, it is important to note that corn is an
intensively cultivated and managed crop with which producers have a great deal of
experience. The draft EIS documents the well-understood mechanisms for effective
management of this gene flow potential in seed production, noting that “[I]solation and
borders effectively limit the level of unintended off-types in the final product and their use is
supported by decades of experience with plant breeders and the seed industry.”74
The record shows that with respect to the potential for gene flow between Event 3272
corn and other corn varieties, the Syngenta Stewardship Program provides for all contracted
growers to include 12 border rows in the harvest of Event 3272 corn to address adventitious
pollination. The record further shows that 97.12% of adventitious pollination occurs in the
first 12 rows. This preventative measure means that, by including the first 12 non-corn-
amylase rows on all sides of the field in the harvest of the Event 3272 corn, 99.9% of
amylase containing grain will be accounted for in the dedicated grain supply system and
directed to dry grind ethanol production.75
