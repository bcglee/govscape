Requirement of testing for Event 3272 corn
During the comment periods for other petitions for granting nonregulated status, some
commenters have requested that USDA require and provide testing for GE products in non-GE
production systems. However, there are no nationally-established regulations involving testing
or limits of GE material in non-GE systems. As a member of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization (BIO), Syngenta is pledging to work with the framework of the new BIO Quality
Management Program (www.bio.org), and has stated to APHIS that a detection method or test
that enables event identity for Event 3272 corn will be made available to the public prior to
commercialization (see Appendix G). Additionally, because Event 3272 corn is unlikely to pose
a plant pest risk (USDA-APHIS 2008), APHIS has no regulatory authority over Event 3272 corn
and is unable to impose restrictions on this GE corn variety.
D. Comparison of Alternatives
Table 2, below, briefly summarizes the results for each of the issues raised in the Environmental
Consequences (Section IV) by each of the alternatives described in the Alternatives section
(Section III).
