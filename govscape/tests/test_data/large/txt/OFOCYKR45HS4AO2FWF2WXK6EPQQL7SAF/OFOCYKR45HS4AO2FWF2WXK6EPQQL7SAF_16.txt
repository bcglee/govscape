cover absent from tilled agriculture. The lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus)
feeds primarily on seeds of weeds and available crops, such as corn and wheat. This species has
the potential to damage agricultural crops, although it can also be considered beneficial when
eating pest insects, such as grasshoppers and cutworms.
Although many of the invertebrate organisms found in corn-producing areas are considered
pests, such as the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and the corn rootworm (Diabrotica
spp.), many others are considered beneficial. Numerous insects and related arthropods perform
valuable functions; they pollinate plants, contribute to the decay of organic matter, cycle soil
nutrients, and attack other insects and mites that are considered to be pests.
Plants
The landscape surrounding a corn field varies depending on the region. In certain areas, corn
fields may be bordered by other corn (or any other crop); fields may also be surrounded by
wooden and/or pasture/grassland areas. Therefore, the types of vegetation, including weeds,
around a corn field depend on the area where the corn is planted. A variety of weeds dwell in and
around corn fields; those species will also vary depending on the region where the corn is
planted. Weeds compete with crops for water, nutrients, light, and other growth factors. Each
year in the U.S., corn yields are threatened by more than 200 weed species (Heap 2008). Weed
species such as giant foxtail and barnyardgrass have been shown to reduce corn yields by up to
13 and 35%, respectively (Bosnic and Swanton 1997, Fausay et al. 1997). Common weeds that
cause problems in corn fields include velvetleaf, common cocklebur, common lambsquarters
(annuals) and quackgrass and Johnsongrass (perennials).
Biological Diversity
Species diversity and abundance in corn agro-ecosystems may differ between the three corn
production methods; GE, conventional or organic. Many studies over the last 10 years have
investigated the differences in biological diversity and abundance between GE and non-GE
fields, particularly those GE crops that are resistant to insects (e.g., Bt crops) or herbicides (e.g.,
glyphosate-tolerant or glufosinate-tolerant crops.) Each side of the GE debate has a multitude of
studies to pick from to support their case; opponents of GE will point to studies that indicate
potential decreases in biological diversity and/or abundance due to GE crops, particularly due to
the presence of a pesticidal protein in some GE crops (Bt) (e.g., (Hansen Jesse and Obrycki
2000, Ponsard et al. 2002, Pilcher et al. 2005). GE-detractors will also use studies investigating
how decreases in weed populations due to the use of herbicides and herbicide-tolerant crops
results in decreases in animal populations that use weeds as a food or refuge source, which may
reduce overall biological diversity in farm fields (Marshall et al. 2003). On the other side,
supporters of GE technology will use studies that compare GE crops, such as Bt corn, to non-GE
crops sprayed with insecticides to demonstrate that GE crops do not cause any changes in
arthropod abundance or diversity (e.g., (Bitzer et al. 2005, Torres and Ruberson 2005, Romeis et
al. 2006, Marvier et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008, Wolfenbarger et al. 2008) or may even increase
biological diversity (e.g., (Romeis et al. 2006, Marvier et al. 2007, Wolfenbarger et al. 2008) in
agro-ecosystems. GE proponents may also showcase studies that demonstrate herbicide-tolerant
corn, when compared to conventional corn production, does not result in changes in arthropod
abundance and may even increase species diversity during different times of the year (e.g.,
(Brooks et al. 2003, Haughton et al. 2003, Hawes et al. 2003, Roy et al. 2003).
