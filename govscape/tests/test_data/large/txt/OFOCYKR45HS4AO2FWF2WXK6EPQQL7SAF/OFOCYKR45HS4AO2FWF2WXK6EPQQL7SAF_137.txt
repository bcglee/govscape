C. Closed-Loop System
The already low likelihood that Event 3272 corn would be diverted from the farm to the
ethanol plant is reduced even further by the strict controls evident in the commercial system
developed by Syngenta for this product. Event 3272 will be commercialized solely in a
traditional closed-loop system, replete with effective control points. The system relies on
concentrated acreage, contract grown product within the geographic footprint of the ethanol
plant, stewardship mandates, and grower agreements for delivery to ensure a smooth,
uninterrupted, and verifiable supply of grain to end users – dry grind ethanol plants.
These dry grain ethanol plants will contract directly with growers in their geographic area
or indirectly through third party grain suppliers for the production and delivery of the Event 3272
corn. These grower grain contracts will specify a delivery location that either will be an ethanol
plant or a storage site (country elevator) within a specified radius, a delivery date for which a
window for delivery will be specified, and the acres or bushels per acre to be delivered. 66 The
delivery will be made either by the growers delivering the corn directly to the ethanol plant or to
an elevator or truck transporter. Syngenta will sell hybrids with Event 3272 only to growers with
a valid contract with an ethanol plant and who execute a Syngenta Stewardship Agreement that
will ensure and facilitate appropriate cultivation, handling, detection, communication, inspection,
and audits. The contracts in this closed-loop system will contain legal and financial incentives
for compliance.
Syngenta’s closed-loop system diverts Event 3272 away from the production of
processed corn food products such as masa (tortillas and chips). The stewardship controls
imposed in Syngenta’s closed-loop system are designed to prevent the contracted grower from
inadvertently delivering Event 3272 to a masa facility or to a local elevator that is an open-
market supplier to a masa facility.
D. Stewardship Roles and Responsibilities Within Closed-Loop System
In this closed-loop system, the principle contract actors – the producer, the
grower, and the ethanol plant (end user) – each have specific stewardship roles and
responsibilities. These stewardship roles and responsibilities are consistent with Syngenta’s
adoption of the best practices and quality management principles derived from the BIO
stewardship program and are delineated below.

66 A “country grain elevator” is a grain elevator that services a limited geographic area. See John S. Seitz,
Memorandum, Nov. 1995 at 3, available at www.epa.gov/ttncaaa1/t5/memoranda/grainfnl.pdf. It is very rare
even in the commodity corn market for corn to be delivered from distances greater than 100 miles from the
plants and only occurs where there is a shortage of local corn due to drought.
