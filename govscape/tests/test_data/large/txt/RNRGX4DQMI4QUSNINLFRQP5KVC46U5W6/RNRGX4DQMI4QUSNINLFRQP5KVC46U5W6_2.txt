New Cool-Season Legume Video
Clemson University in cooperation with the USDA-
NRCS has produced a video called 'New Legumes
for Cover Crops.' The new video documents the
release and use of new cool-season annual legumes
for use as cover crops and conservation tillage
plants in the Southeast. The video highlights

PMC, Auburn University, and the University of
Georgia. Four new legumes are highlighted in the
