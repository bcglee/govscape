Establishment
If possible, obtain the seed and corms from local
sources to maintain genetic diversity of white
brodiaea and for the best adaptation to local
conditions. Some nurseries may label their corms
and seeds according to geographic source. If planting
flowering-size corms, they can be directly planted
outside. Plant the corms in the fall in full sun. The
less crowded the more the corms will offset. Plant
them 2 to 4 inches apart and 4 inches deep. A well-
drained soil that is light and loose will produce bigger
corms. Water and weed the patch regularly and
protect it from small and large mammals, insects, and
