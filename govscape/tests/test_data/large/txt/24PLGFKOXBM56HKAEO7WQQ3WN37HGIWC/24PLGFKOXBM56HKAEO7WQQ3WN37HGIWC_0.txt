Notice of Souroe Identified Plant Release
Sideoats Grama
The USDA-Soil Conservation Service (SCS), the University of Northern
Iowa (UNI), the (Iowa) County Integrated Roadside Vegetation
Management Program (IIRVMP), the Iowa Department of Transportation
(IDOT), and the Iowa Crop Improvement Association (ICIA) announce the
release of source identified (Central Iowa) germplasm of sideoats
grama, Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) (Tom.).
The sideoats grama has been assigned the SCS accession number 9062279.
origin: Central Iowa.
Sideoats grama is a warm season perennial grass of mid-height (three
feet, 1 meter). It is generally considered a bunch grrass but has
short scaly rhizomes and rarely forms a sod. Leaves of sideoats are
flat with a width of about one centimeter (1/2 inch). An identifying
characteristic is perpendicular, often opposite, hairs on the margins
of the leaves. These hairs grow from gland-like bumpq which may be
easily seen with a magnifying lens. Oat.- like seeds hang from one side
,
of the stem (rachis) hence "side-oats"
Sideoats seeds per pound average 191,000. A seeding rate of 25 to 30
pure live seeds (PLS) per linear foot in 30 inch (30 inches to 40 plus
inches) rows (two to three PLS pounds/acre) for seed production is
sufficient. Broadcast rates for pasture seeding should run six to
eight PLS pounds per acre (15 to 25 bulk pounds/acre). Seed should be
planted 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in a firm relatively weed free seedbed.
Seedling vigor is good and stands are comparatively easy to establish
where competition is controlled. Burndown chemical sprays have been
used to reduce competition when reduced tillage methods are used in
establishment. Post-emergence broadleaf sprays have been used when
sideoats is past the four-leaf stage. Seed yields are good and seed
have been commonly combined. Yields of 400 pounds per acre have been
commonly harvested on managed stands.
Collections of sideoats from east to west across Iowa prevent positive
assessment of all pollination or chromosome characteristics. Sideoats
is known to be variable in chromosome numbers and in reproduction
mechanisms. Plants are often cross-pollinated, with many hybrids
being formed in the area of adaptation. Also, plants with chromosome
numbers greater than 52 are known to commonly reproduce asexually.
Pollination may still be required for seeds to form. For isolation
requirements, Iowa sideoats will be considered cross-pollinated.
Sideoats is adapted to most upland soils. Ecotypes are adapted to
areas with as little as 14 inches to over 50 inches of average annual
