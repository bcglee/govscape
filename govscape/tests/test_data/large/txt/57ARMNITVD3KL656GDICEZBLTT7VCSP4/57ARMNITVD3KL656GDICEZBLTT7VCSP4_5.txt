Managing Interactions Between
Humans and Double-Crested Cormorants
In summary, DCCO’s are well suited for the
Midwest because the habitats required for nesting and
feeding young are those that are commonly found

are found throughout the interior of North America, and
their numbers are limited in the sense of the size of the
colony rather than in their distribution. The exception
