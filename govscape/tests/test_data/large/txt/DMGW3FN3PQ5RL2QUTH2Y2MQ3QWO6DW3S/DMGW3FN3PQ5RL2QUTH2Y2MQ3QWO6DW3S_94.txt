based on scientific knowledge of wildlife populations and habitats. For example, the National Wildlife
Research Center conducts research regarding the behavior of predators, the effectiveness of wildlife damage
control methods, and many other topics related to the control of wildlife damage. This research is one basis
for WS’ approaches to the control of wildlife damage.
Direct control measures, which also include non-lethal methods, are provided by WS on a cost-reimbursable
basis (Section 2.1 and 3.1.1). Resource owners experiencing wildlife damage on private property must pay
out-of-pocket for direct control services and do not receive tax dollars to offset losses.
Tax dollars appropriated to the program are congressionally designated to be spent on wildlife damage
control activities as broadly identified in the Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 and the Rural
Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988. As such, these funds are used
to protect agriculture, personal property, and natural resources (including threatened and endangered species)
from wildlife damage as well as to safeguard public health and safety. These funds may be spent on private
or public lands in accordance with national, state, or local laws to conduct wildlife damage control activities,
and based upon requests for services.
Tax dollars spent on the WS program have been appropriated by Congress based on its decision to serve the
public interest by avoiding damage from wildlife. These expenditures are not only for the good of
agricultural producers but for the health and welfare of the general public and other urban and industrial
concerns. In addition, to the extent that WS’ control methods eliminate predators that prey on other fish or
wildlife, such as gull depredation of waterfowl nests, WS’ activities contribute to the protection of wildlife
valued for recreational purposes. Regarding concerns about spending tax dollars on the use of lethal control
methods, WS will continue to devote funds to research to improve control methods, both lethal and non-
lethal, and will encourage these techniques through technical assistance activities.
Comment 16. Why were tax dollars spent on killing two robins?
Table 2 in the EA correctly states that two robins were killed in FY 1998, but the data shown for FY 2000
are incorrect. In FY 2000, a total of 5 American robins were killed and 617 hazed. WS has edited Table 2
accordingly. The text on page 20, discussing WS’ impact on American robins, correctly stated the number
of robins hazed, killed, and freed.
The seven American robins were lethally removed to reinforce the use of non-lethal methods and/or to
remove persistent birds from damaging property or agriculture that would not respond to non-lethal methods.
See comment number 2 and 5 which provide further discussion.
Comment 17. (I) oppose the management of migratory birds.
The comment implies that people should not interfere with nature. Natural systems are in a state of dynamic
equilibrium. Balance is not static. Some species are increasing in numbers, while others are decreasing.
Such changes are constantly occurring. Human populations are an integral component of this balance.
Humans impact wildlife through activities such as crop and livestock production, urban development, and
recreation. Similarly, wildlife activities affect human activities. The presence of humans and their activities
can impose an element of management simply because of competition for resources and because of the
changes humans cause in the landscape. Sound management practices take into account the dynamic state of
the balance of nature, the often diverse interests of humans, wildlife needs, and the conflicts that sometimes
result. Human influences on all ecosystems are present despite WS’ activities.
WS does not manage migratory birds. The Current Program is not likely, nor designed, to impact migratory
bird populations on a state-wide basis. However, some local flocks have been reduced or removed on a site-
by-site basis. It is the goal of WS to manage wildlife caused damage, rather than to control or manage
wildlife populations. See Appendix 1 and Section 1.5, Authority and Compliance.
