3.0.1 Method of Analysis
In the development of this EA, interdisciplinary issues concerning biological, economic, sociocultural, and
physical impacts were identified by public involvement, interagency consultations, and WS specialists and
biologists for evaluation. Each of the alternatives are examined against the following issues.
3.0.2 Issues
The following migratory bird management issues were identified as relevant to this process:
1. Effectiveness of control measures in reducing or minimizing damage.
2. Impact of control methods on non-targets, including Threatened and Endangered (T&E) Species.
3. Impact on the populations of migratory birds (target species).
4. Humaneness of control methods. Humaneness is a person’s perception of the impact of an action
on animal pain and suffering. Individuals may perceive the humaneness of an action differently.
5. Aesthetics of migratory birds and the damage they cause.
3.0.3 Issues not Analyzed in Detail with Rational
The actions discussed in this EA involve minimal ground disturbance or construction (See ‘Technical
Assistance’ on page 9 and ‘Direct Control’ on page 11). Therefore, the following resource values are either
not affected, or are not expected to be significantly affected by any of the alternatives analyzed: soils, geology,
minerals, water quality/quantity, flood plains, wetlands, air quality, prime and unique farmlands, aquatic
resources, vegetation, or cultural resources There are no significant irreversible or irretrievable commitments
or resources. These resources will not be analyzed further.
In accordance with EO 12898, all WS activities are evaluated to ensure Environmental Justice. Because the
management methods proposed would not pose significant risk to humans or their environment, it is not
anticipated that the proposed action would result in any adverse or disproportionate environmental impacts to
minority and low-income persons or populations.
3.1 Impact of the Current IWDM Program (No Action) Alternative
3.1.1 Effectiveness of control measures.
The effectiveness of the program can be measured in terms of reduced economic losses, decreased health and
safety hazards, and minimized property damage. These factors are considered on a case-by-case basis, through
the use of the WS Decision Model (Appendix 3).
The Current Program provides a full range of control options which are applied in an integrated fashion to best
resolve damage situations, while at the same time protecting people and the environment. The IWDM
incorporates the most effective methods of resolving wildlife-caused damage. WS personnel are certified,
trained, skilled professionals experienced in the application of IWDM.
WS’ cooperators reimburse the agency for the wildlife damage management that they receive. A client
satisfaction survey indicated that 81.5% of recipients believed that the methods and tools were effective (USDA
