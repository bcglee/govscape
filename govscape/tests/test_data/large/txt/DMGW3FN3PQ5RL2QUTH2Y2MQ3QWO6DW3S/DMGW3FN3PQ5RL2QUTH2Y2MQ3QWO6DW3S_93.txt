The word, ‘recorded’, is used throughout the document to relate both verified and reported information
recorded on WS’ MIS database.
On page 7 under the subsection, Damage to Property, the sentence beginning, “In FY 1996-2000, WS
received damage complaints of ...”, now reads, “In FY 1996-2000, WS recorded (verified and reported)
damage complaints of...” On page 8 under the same subsection, the sentence beginning, “WS has received
reports from solid waste...”, now reads, “WS has recorded (verified and reported) dollar damage from solid
waste...”
The edited sentences mentioned above have also been changed in the body of the EA.
WS used program records to compile damage estimates. When people contact WS for assistance they
frequently provide estimated costs of damage. WS does not have the resources, responsibility, or authority
to verify all damage reports. Although not comprehensive, the summary of these records represented the best
information available, even though it most likely underestimated the total damage caused by migratory birds.
Cooperators are not compensated for losses, therefore they have nothing to gain by over reporting damages.
Damage reports were received from individuals; businesses; State, county and municipal governments;
Federal agencies; and others.
WS has the legal mandate to respond to all requests for wildlife damage management regardless of extent of
loss, and it is program policy to assist each requester to minimize losses. In order to fulfill WS’ directives
(Section 1.5), wildlife damage management is conducted to prevent or minimize damage and protected
resources while complying with strict measures to ensure public safety as well as the protection of domestic
animals, and non-target and T&E species. Therefore, wildlife damage management is not based on
punishing offending animals but rather as a means of reducing damage, predicting future damage, and
conducted using the WS’ Decision Model described in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997,
revised). The imminent threat of damage or loss of resources is often sufficient for individual actions to be
initiated. In Chapter 2 of the APHIS-USDA-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised), the WS Decision
Model for selecting strategies for wildlife damage management identifies several factors, including
anticipation of potential impacts, that demonstrate the scientific and professional basis of WS’ activities.
For example, in the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, et al. vs. Hugh Thompson, Forest Supervisor for the
Dixie National Forest, et al., the United States District Court of Utah denied plaintiffs' motion for
preliminary injunction. In part, the court found that a forest supervisor need only show that damage from
predators is threatened to establish a need for wildlife damage management (U.S. District Court of Utah
1993).
Comment 14. Support Alternative 2.
Thank you for your comment. All aspects of Alternative 2 relating to non-lethal direct control and technical
assistance are included in the Proposed Action (Alternative 1), and they are in fact given first consideration
in developing management strategies to manage damage by migratory birds. See an example of the decision-
making process used under the WS Decision Model in comment 12.
Comment 15. WS should use humane and progressive methods... do not want tax dollars used to kill
wild birds.
The WS program attempts to minimize conflicts between humans and wildlife, and WS seeks to carry out its
authority based on biological research and knowledge. Control of wildlife populations or removal of
individual animals is a scientifically recognized component of wildlife management, as are preservation and
the maintenance of populations USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised). WS’ practices are
