APPENDIX 1
Authority of Federal and State Agencies in wildlife damage management in Washington
Wildlife Services Legislative Authority
The primary statutory authority for the Wildlife Services program is the Animal Damage Control Act of
1931, which provides that:
“The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to conduct such investigations,
experiments, and tests as he may deem necessary in order to determine, demonstrate, and
promulgate the best methods of eradication, suppression, or bringing under control on national
forests and other areas of the public domain as well as on State, Territory or privately owned
lands of mountain lions, wolves, coyotes, bobcats, prairie dogs, gophers, ground squirrels,
jackrabbits, brown tree snakes and other animals injurious to agriculture, horticulture, forestry,
animal husbandry, wild game animals , furbearing animals, and birds, and for the protection of
stock and other domestic animals through the suppression of rabies and tularemia in predatory
or other wild animals; and to conduct campaigns for the destruction or control of such animals.
Provided that in carrying out the provisions of this Section, the Secretary of Agriculture may
cooperate with States, individuals, and public and private agencies, organizations, and
institutions.”
Since 1931, with the changes in societal values, WS policies and its programs place greater emphasis on
the part of the Act discussing “bringing (damage) under control”, rather than “eradication” and
“suppression” of wildlife populations. In 1988, Congress strengthened the legislative authority of WS with
the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This Act states, in part:
“That hereafter, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized, except for urban rodent control, to
conduct activities and to enter into agreements with States, local jurisdictions, individuals, and
public and private agencies, organizations, and institutions in the control of nuisance mammals
and birds and those mammals and birds species that are reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and to
deposit any money collected under any such agreement into the appropriation accounts that
incur the costs to be available immediately and to remain available until expended for Animal
Damage Control activities.”
U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service Legislative Authority
The Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) authority for action is based on the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of
1918 (as amended), which implements treaties with Great Britain (for Canada), the United Mexican States,
Japan, and the Soviet Union. Section 3 of this Act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture:
“From time to time, having due regard to the zones of temperature and distribution, abundance,
economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of migratory flight of such birds, to determine
when, to what extent, if at all, and by what means, it is compatible with the terms of the convention
to allow hunting, taking, capture, killing, possession, sale, purchase, shipment, transportation,
carriage, or export of any such bird, or any part, nest, or egg thereof, and to adopt suitable
regulations permitting and governing the same, in accordance with such determinations, which
regulations shall become effective when approved by the President”.
The authority of the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to the Migratory Bird Treaty was transferred to
