The context in which migratory bird damage management impacts could occur are largely limited to the
resources (people, property, non-target species, natural resources, agriculture and the migratory bird
population) within the State of Washington. However, certain members of society at large may be concerned
with some issues and impacts within the state (for example; humaneness, migratory bird population viability,
air traffic safety, and impacts on threatened and endangered species). Because less tangible issues such as
social values for wildlife are more widespread, WS considers them in the broader context. However, the
more tangible effects are on properties and people who live in the State of Washington.
In determining the intensity (the severity) of impacts, WS evaluated the proposal against the ten criteria
established in Section 1508.27 (see the FONSI section for a complete list of items that could trigger
significance). WS found that the degree to which the proposal could trigger the criteria was low to
nonexistent. For example, “...The degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or
threatened species or its habitat...” and “...whether the action threatens a violation of Federal, State, or local
law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment” was low to nonexistent.
The analysis in this EA was driven by the issues raised during the NEPA process, and the impacts of the
proposal were determined to be not significant after examination in light of both the context and intensity of
the impacts, as defined by CEQ.
Comment 12. The EA does not provide an adequate description of the proposed action. The EA is
vague about the methods used to evaluate and assess damage, the specific recommendations that
typically are made in a damage situation, how a damage control program will typically be applied,
what the costs of various programs might be, and what the duration of remediation of a problem using
different approaches might be. The EA should provide examples of past efforts that span the range of
species, conflicts and responses.
WS does not believe the proposed action can be further defined because of the countless scenarios that could
occur. Pages 12 through 24 in the EA discuss WS’ Proposed Action.
WS personnel use the WS Decision Model as a site specific tool to develop the most appropriate strategy at
each location. The WS Decision Model is an analytical thought process used by WS personnel for
evaluating and responding to wildlife damage management requests. When a request for assistance is
received and after consultation with the requester, WS personnel evaluate the appropriateness of strategies,
and methods are evaluated in the context of their availability (legal and administrative) and suitability (based
on biological, economic and social considerations). Following this evaluation, the methods deemed to be
practical are formed into a damage management strategy for the situation. For example, on most properties,
wildlife damage may occur whenever food, water and habitat for the damaging species are present. WS
personnel and the property owner/manager monitor and reevaluate the situation to devise the most effective
solution. If one method or combination of methods fails to stop damage, a different strategy or a modified
strategy may be implemented. If the strategy is effective, the need for damage management is ended but
monitoring continues. In terms of the WS Decision Model, most damage management efforts consist of a
continuous feedback loop between receiving the request, implementing a strategy and monitoring the results.
The following scenario is provided to show how each potential threat is unique and cannot be predetermined
due to the variable nature of the natural environment.
