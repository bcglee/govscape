Assess Problem
Each request undergoes an initial assessment to determine if the problem is within the purview of APHIS ADC.
Requests determined to be within the purview of APHIS ADC are subjected to a detailed assessment of the
damage.
Purview Determination
The diversity and scope of activities conducted by the APHIS ADC program is defined by Federal, State, and
local laws, as well as MOUs and agreements. The purview of APHIS ADC varies among the 50 States in
which the program is administered as a consequence of differences in State and local laws, MOUs, and
agreements established with the APHIS ADC program in each State.
Most requests involving wildlife damage to agriculture, facilities and structures, or natural resources, or if
wildlife pose a threat to public health and safety, result in APHIS ADC providing some type of wildlife damage
management assistance. Requests to address problems that are clearly not within the responsibility or authority
of the program in a State are usually referred to an appropriate source of assistance as a professional courtesy.
Detailed Assessment of Damage
In assessing the damage, immediate attention is given to confirming that damage was caused by vertebrate
animals, the species responsible for damage, and the type of damage (e.g., bird hazard at an airport, loss of
livestock, or flooded crops). Commonly this requires an inspection, depending on the type and complexity of
the problem. Then severity of the problem is considered in deciding which management options are potentially
applicable. During inspections, damages normally are confirmed by APHIS ADC personnel.
The extent and magnitude of damage is also important in assessing current and potential economic losses in the
absence of control. The resource manager or affected party is usually the source of this type of information.
Pertinent aspects of the damage history are also relevant. For example, is this a recurring problem or is it the
first episode of this type? What control actions, if any, have been attempted by the resource manager or affected
party? What were the results? If no further control action is taken, is damage likely to continue or recur?
Evaluate Wildlife Damage Control Methods
Once the problem assessment is completed, all available methods are evaluated for their practicality.
Conceptually, this component of the APHIS ADC decision model consists of a series of legal, administrative,
and environmental screens for each potential method (Figure 2-5). The result of this evaluation is one or more
methods practical for further consideration in formulating alternative wildlife damage control strategies (see -
“Formulate Wildlife Damage Control Strategy” on p. 2-32).
A list of control methods for the 17 representative target species (analyzed in detail in Chapter 4) is provided
in Table 2-4. To facilitate an understanding of the relative availability of control methods and who generally
applies them, methods are organized under three action approaches to managing wildlife damage problems
(Table 2-4).
One action approach is management of the resources susceptible to damage. It includes those activities designed
to improve or modify current resource management practices, such as husbandry and cultural practices, as well
as modification of human behavior. Application of these methods typically is the responsibility of the resource
manager or affected party. However, APHIS ADC personnel make technical assistance recommendations -
concerning these methods.
