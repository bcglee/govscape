APHIS ADC Decision Model
(USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS, Chapter 2)
APHIS ADC personnel receive requests for assistance that encompass the broad range of wildlife damage
problems. Some requests are relatively simple with straightforward solutions. Excluding squirrels from bird
feeders or raccoons from chimneys represent typical examples. Requests for assistance to protect endangered
species or human safety at air-ports are examples of more challenging problems in which a high level of interest
is shown by various groups, organizations, and agencies. Unlike the previous squirrel and raccoon examples,
the formulation, implementation, and success of an IPM strategy is frequently contingent on highly coordinated
and cooperative efforts with many parties.
Each request for assistance is unique regardless of its complexity. Therefore, the decision-making process must
be predicated on consideration of the specific biologic, sociocultural, economic, physical, and other
environmental circumstances associated with a given wildlife damage problem. Ideally, a variety of methods
should be available for the decision-maker to formulate an effective IPM strategy (Table 2-4). Access to a -
variety of methods allows field personnel greater flexibility and a better opportunity to formulate an effective
strategy for each specific request for assistance.
The decision-making steps APHIS ADC personnel take are fundamentally the same as those described in
Chapter 1 for other professionals (Figure 1-1). The APHIS ADC decision model presented in Figure 2-4 is a
more detailed version of the general professional action model (Figure 1-1) that was specifically developed to
depict the APHIS ADC decision process. The compartment entitled “Evaluate Wildlife Damage Control
Methods” from the APHIS ADC decision model (Figure 2-4) has been expanded to show the important factors
given consideration at this step (Figure 2-5). The APHIS ADC decision model can be applied to the other
program alternatives. Control methods selected under each alternative could be screened and evaluated leaving
the wildlife manager with the best solution under the constraints of the alternative. Some methods available for
evaluation and consideration in the formulation of control strategies are listed in Table 2-4. Representative,
detailed examples of types of requests for assistance received by the APHIS ADC program have been developed
to further demonstrate some of the complexities of formulating effective IPM strategies (Appendix N). The
reader is encouraged to refer to these specific examples to gain a better understanding of the APHIS ADC
decision process.
All Federal actions are subject to NEPA (Public Law 91-190, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). APHIS ADC complies
with CEQ regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.) and the APHIS Implementing Guidelines (7
CFR 372) as part of the decision-making process. The relationship of the NEPA process to APHIS ADC
decision-making is shown in Figure 2-6.
Wildlife damage decision models can be useful management tools (Schmidt et al. 1985). They can serve as
meaningful communication instruments as well. The decision model presented in Figure 2-4 is designed to serve
as both these functions; however, it necessarily oversimplifies complex thought processes.
Receive Request for Assistance
APHIS ADC is a service-oriented program that works on a request basis. Requests may be received by phone,
in person, as referrals from others, or a variety of other means. Requests for assistance encompass a broad
range of wildlife conflicts from nuisance wildlife in urban structures to more intricate problems, such as wildlife
hazards to public safety, predation of livestock, or protection of endangered species.
