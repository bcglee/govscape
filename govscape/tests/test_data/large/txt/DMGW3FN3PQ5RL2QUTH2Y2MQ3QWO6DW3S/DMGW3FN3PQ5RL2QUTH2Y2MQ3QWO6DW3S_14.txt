Table 1. contains only the damage reported to WS. This does not represent all of the damage affected by each of the species
addressed in this table. These damages by species are not all inclusive (e. g. any bird species may pose a threat at airports).
Direct Control:
Direct control is provided by WS personnel in the field. Field personnel use the WS Decision Model (Appendix
3) to identify the problem, implement practical control actions, and monitor effectiveness. Direct control is
usually requested when a resource ownerâ€™s efforts to discourage or frighten birds away have been ineffective
and technical assistance alone is inadequate. Direct control services are generally provided on a cost-
reimbursable basis. This funding is provided by the resource owners, private businesses, or local, state or
federal agencies. WS personnel use the IWDM approach to develop practical methods for resolving damage
problems and implement the most appropriate measures on a site-by-site basis. Direct control measures
provided by WS in Washington may include: harassment, exclusion, nest/egg removal, egg addling, shooting,
the restricted-use avicide DRC-1339 Concentrate - Gulls (EPA# 56228-17), capture and translocation or
euthanasia. Birds are captured using the most appropriate and humane method(s) available. Capture methods
include: cage traps, decoy traps, nets, and the capture drug alpha chloralose (AC). Avicide use is restricted
to the sites and methods listed on the label and any unconsumed baits are retrieved and disposed of according
to label direction.
2.2 Alternative 2: Non-lethal Control and Technical Assistance Only Alternative
Alternative 2 would discontinue any lethal direct control of migratory birds by WS, except in emergency
situations involving human health and safety. If lethal direct control were used in other situations, it would be
employed by persons or programs other than WS. Both non-lethal direct control and technical assistance as
described in 2.1 would continue to be provided by WS. Requests for lethal direct control would likely be
referred to other wildlife management agencies. The WDFW would not accept the sole responsibility for lethal
removal or capture and euthanizing of migratory birds (WDFW , pers. comm.).

2.3 Alternative 3: Lethal Control and Technical Assistance Only Alternative
Alternative 3 would discontinue any non-lethal control of migratory birds by WS. Non-lethal control would
be employed by persons or programs other than WS. Technical assistance would be provided, but the
implementation of non-lethal methods would be the responsibility of the cooperator.
2.4 Alternative 4: Exhaust All Non-lethal Methods Before Lethal Methods Are Considered
Alternative 4 differs from the Current Program in that the Current Program recognizes non-lethal methods as
an important dimension of IWDM, gives them first consideration in the formulation of each control strategy,
and recommends or uses them when practical before recommending or using lethal methods. In contrast,
Alternative 4 would require that all non-lethal methods be implemented regardless of practicality before any
lethal methods are recommended or used.
2.5 Alternative 5: No Federal Program Alternative
Alternative 5 would consist of no direct control or technical assistance offered or employed by WS. Under this
alternative, wildlife damage conflicts would be handled by private resource owners and managers, private
contractors, and/or other government agencies, and is discussed in detail in the USDA-APHIS-ADC
Programmatic EIS (1997, revised).
