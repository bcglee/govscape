assist with a determination of the likelihood of whether or not the program is having an effect on populations.
In addition, the expertise of the Federal and state migratory bird management agencies are used to draw
conclusions on the effects on populations.
The Current Program is not likely, nor designed, to impact migratory bird populations on a state-wide basis.
However, some local flocks have been reduced or removed on a site-by-site basis. Most of WS’ lethal efforts
are directed toward gulls (Table 2). It is the goal of WS to manage wildlife-caused damage, rather than to
control or manage wildlife populations, and there has been no discernable impact on population levels
(USFWS , pers. comm.). For those species where the typical level of harassment and lethal take is low
3
(Table 2), the impacts of these actions at the local, regional, or national population scale are insignificant
(USFWS , pers. comm.). The USFWS ( pers. comm. ) concurs that the level of take of migratory birds for
2 3
the purpose of site-specific damage control, as described under the Current Program Alternative (Proposed
Action), is not likely to affect migratory bird populations at the regional or national scale.
Comment 10. The EA does not contain sufficient information to indicate whether WS will confine its
efforts to the species mentioned in the EA, or will expand to other species as it deems necessary.
This EA evaluates ways by which the responsibility to reduce human/wildlife conflicts can be carried out
to resolve conflicts with migratory birds that include, but are not necessarily limited to the species listed on
page 2 of the EA. The species listed in the EA are the most likely species to be targeted based on historic
records (USDA 1995-2000). Generally, species in highest abundance are the ones causing damage, by virtue
of their numbers. It is unlikely, but not impossible to expect that there may be other species that could create
damage at such a level that WS would be called. If any type of action were needed to address damage
caused by different groups of species outside to scope of the analysis, a new analysis would be developed in
a revision (i.e. categorical exclusion or amended EA). WS advises appropriate State and Federal wildlife
management agencies of WS’ actions to assure local, state and regional knowledge of wildlife population
trends and status.
The wording, ‘migratory birds that include, but are not necessarily limited to...’ is used to allow WS to
address immediate threats to agriculture, property, natural resources and human health and safety caused by
a migratory bird species not discussed in this document, but within the scope of the analysis. If this were to
occur, an analysis of that species’ status and WS’ impact on the target species would be included in the
Annual Review of the EA. Individual actions are Categorically Excluded because of the history and low
likelihood of management actions. Any substantive changes to the EA will require WS to inform the public
of the availability of an amended NEPA document and a 30-day public comment period.
Comment 11. This EA does not satisfy the site-specificity requirement of the NEPA.
The underlying intent for preparing any EA, as defined under CEQ NEPA regulations, is to determine if a
proposed action might have a significant impact. This EA process has been issue driven, meaning issues that
were raised during the interdisciplinary process and through public involvement that were substantive, were
used to drive the analysis and determine the significance of the environmental impacts of the proposal and its
alternatives. Therefore, the level of site-specificity must be appropriate to the issues listed. The substantive
issues analyzed were effectiveness of control measures, impacts on non-target species, impact on the target
population, humaneness of methods, and aesthetics of migratory birds. WS has determined that its analysis
is adequate, because further site specific information would not change the analysis, add to the public’s
understanding of the proposal, or provide additional useful or relevant information to the Decision-maker
(Eccleston 1995).
The EA has resulted in a Finding of No Significant Impact, after WS considered both the context and
intensity of the potential impacts to determine significance (Section 1508.27):
