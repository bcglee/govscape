(Anas crecca), and wood duck (Aix sponsa).
Diving ducks: On average, WS has hazed 91 and lethally removed 3 diving ducks per year over the last 5 years
on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). Lethally removed birds may have included: ring-necked
duck (Aythya collaris), greater scaup (Aythya marila), common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), and
bufflehead (Bucephala albeola).
Mallard: On average, WS has hazed 105 and lethally removed 14 mallards per year over the last 5 years on
projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). One non-target mallard was lethally removed between FY
1996-2000.
3.1.4 Humaneness of control methods
WS control methods employed under the Current Program are listed in Appendix 2. Descriptions of those
methods are found in the USDA-APHIS- ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised).
The issue of humaneness, as it relates to the killing or capturing of wildlife is an important and complex
concept that can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Humaneness is a person’s perception of harm or pain
inflicted on an animal, and people may perceive the humaneness of an action differently. Some individuals and
groups are opposed to some of the management actions of WS. Most animal welfare organizations do not
oppose the concept of wildlife damage control. However, these organizations support restrictions on control
methods perceived by them as inhumane, and strongly emphasize the use of non-lethal controls. Animal rights
advocates oppose any killing or harming animals for human gain, because they believe animals have rights
equal to or similar to humans (Schmidt 1989, Wywialowski 1991). Most wildlife managers agree that lethal
control is a sound and sometimes necessary wildlife resource management practice (Berryman 1987).
Habitat modification, as would be recommended by WS, would be expected to have little or no effect on
humaneness. Behavior modification (harassment) could be construed by some as being stressful to the target
species. Population management would be viewed by some as being inhumane. WS supports the most
humane, selective, and effective control techniques and continues to incorporate advances into program
activities. WS personnel are experienced professionals, highly skilled in the use of management methods and
are committed to minimizing pain and suffering.
3.1.5 Aesthetics of migratory birds.
Aesthetics is the philosophy dealing with the nature of beauty or the appreciation of beauty. Therefore,
aesthetics is subjective in nature, dependent on what an observer regards as beautiful or distasteful. The mere
knowledge that wildlife exists is a positive benefit to many people (Fulton et al. 1996). Human dimensions of
wildlife damage management include identifying how people are affected by problems or conflicts between them
and wildlife, attempting to understand people’s reactions, and incorporating this information into policy and
management decision processes and programs (Decker and Enck 1996, Decker and Chase 1997). Local
residents who are experiencing damage may want effective methods to be employed, whereas unaffected parties
may not see any need for action. Aesthetically speaking, a passerby may view a large flock of migratory birds
with great delight, whereas the property owner may view the same birds with disdain.
“Wildlife acceptance capacity” is the limit of human tolerance for wildlife or the maximum number of a given
species that can coexist compatibly with local human populations. Wildlife acceptance capacity is also known
as the “cultural carrying capacity”. These terms are important in urban areas, because they define the
sensitivity of a local community to a specific wildlife species. For any given damage situation, there will be
varying thresholds by those directly and indirectly affected by the damage. This threshold of damage is a
primary limiting factor in determining the wildlife acceptance capacity.
