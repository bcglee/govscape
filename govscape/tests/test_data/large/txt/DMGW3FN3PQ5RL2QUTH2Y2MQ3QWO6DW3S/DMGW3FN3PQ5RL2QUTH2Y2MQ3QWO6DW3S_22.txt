Figure 2e. A comparison of 2 population trend indices (CBC-BBS). The bird counts in these analyses are index indicators
of population trends, not estimates of total bird populations.
Northern flickers: The northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) population in Washington appears to be stable,
but fluctuates year-to-year (Fig. 2e), and is commonly abundant year-round in both eastern and western
Washington (WOS 1999). WS has lethally removed 17 birds and freed 24 between FY 1996-2000 (Table 2)
on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). One non-target northern flicker was lethally removed from
a decoy trap between FY 1996-2000.
Great-blue herons: Washingtonâ€™s great-blue heron (Ardea herodias) population in Washington appears to
be stable, but fluctuates greatly from year-to-year (Fig. 2e), and is commonly abundant year-round in both
eastern and western Washington (WOS 1999). Data collected in King County, Washington, showed a 20
year trend of increasing heron numbers (Stabins 2001) in an area where dwindling populations were
believed to occur (The Olympian 2001; The News Tribune 2001). Norman (1995) concluded that heron
populations throughout most of its range in western Washington appeared to be stable. Between FY 1996-
2000, WS has hazed 11 birds, lethally removed 2 and freed 1 (Table 2) on projects relevant to this EA
(USDA 1995-2000).
Other heron species found in the Pacific Northwest include the green heron (Butorides striatus), black-crowned
night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), and American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), neither of which
