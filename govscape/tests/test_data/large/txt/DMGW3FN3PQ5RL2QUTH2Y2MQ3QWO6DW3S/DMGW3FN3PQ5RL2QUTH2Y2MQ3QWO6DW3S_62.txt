Off-site or indirect benefits have to be considered as well. For example, the costs associated with the
suppression of an offending coyote population at one location may be relatively high. But when costs are
considered in the context of the benefit of avoided or continuing loss of sheep in neighboring areas, the costs
of implementing the control strategy may be low.
Overriding social concerns often preclude the use of the most cost- effective methods. The use of pyrotechnic
frightening devices in and around developed areas to reduce damage caused by birds may not be recommended
or used because of noise, aesthetic, or other social concerns. Safe and effective lethal methods may not be used
in a variety of circumstances primarily because of social considerations.
Short- and long-term costs and benefits of wildlife damage management strategies also are important. Methods
such as the propane cannon have substantially higher initial costs in comparison to pyrotechnics, yet may be
less expensive when labor is factored into the strategy budget.
Relative Effectiveness of Methods
Subject to other constraints and considerations previously discussed, APHIS ADC personnel attempt to
recommend the most effective method or combination of methods to resolve problems. Effectiveness of a
method or combination of methods must take into account the variables previously discussed, such as legal and
administrative availability and practicality, as well as their monetary costs, negative environmental impacts, and
most importantly their ability to reduce damage. Ideally, a method or combination of methods should be
selected that produces maximum damage resolution with minimal negative environmental impacts (Owens and
Slate 1991).
Provide Assistance
APHIS ADC program service is delivered to the public by two basic means: technical assistance and direct
control. Technical assistance is the provision of advice, recommendations, information, or materials for use in
managing wildlife damage problems. Its emphasis is on helping others help themselves. Technical assistance
may require substantial effort by APHIS ADC personnel in the decision-making process, but the actual control
activities are the responsibility of the resource manager or affected party. Direct control is the implementation
of control activities by APHIS ADC personnel in the field. Direct control is typically provided when funding
is available and technical assistance alone is inadequate (see p. 2-17 through 2-20 for a more comprehensive
description of technical assistance and direct control). Direct control by APHIS ADC or other appropriately
trained wildlife personnel should be employed when actions may affect sensitive species or sensitive areas of
the public domain or involve certain hazardous materials (Berryman 1972).
Monitor and Evaluate Results of Control Actions
If control measures have been provided by APHIS ADC, it is usually necessary to monitor control actions to
determine if they are achieving the desired results. Return site visits or telephone contacts with the resource
manager represent the most common forms of monitoring conducted by APHIS ADC personnel. Site visits or
phone contacts are also required to monitor equipment placed in the field by APHIS ADC personnel to assess
if it is functioning properly, or to determine if any animals have been captured.
Monitoring control actions is an important step in determining if further assistance is required to responsibly
address the problem. Monitoring also allows APHIS ADC personnel to know when to discontinue control
activities, thus reducing unnecessary environmental impacts and monetary expenditures.
The need for additional assistance is usually identified through routine monitoring and evaluation of control
actions by APHIS ADC personnel. If the recommended strategy is having an effect but damage has not abated,
