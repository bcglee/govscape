with glaucous-winged gulls (Pierotti & Good 1994). On average, WS has hazed 3,921 and lethally removed
117 herring gulls per year over the last 5 years on projects relevant to this EA (Fig. 1c) (USDA 1995-2000).
Ring-billed gull: Ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) are widely distributed throughout the provinces of
Canada and Great-Lakes region, west to the Pacific coast, and south from Washington to central Mexico, the
Gulf of Mexico and eastward through the Mississippi Valley and along the Atlantic coast north to
Massachusetts. An estimated 3 to 4 million individuals inhabited North America in 1990 (Ryder 1993), and
2001 population estimates for Washington are
around 390,011 individuals, based on 106,000
