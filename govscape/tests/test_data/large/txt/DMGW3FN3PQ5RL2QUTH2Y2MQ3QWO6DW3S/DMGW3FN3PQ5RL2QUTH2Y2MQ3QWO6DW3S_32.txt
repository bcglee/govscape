entail the use of shot on a case-by-case basis to determine if deposition of lead shot poses any risk to nontarget
animals. If such risk exists, WS will use nontoxic shot in those situations.
Some potential exists for cumulative impacts to human health and safety related to harassment of roosting or
feeding flocks of migratory birds. If birds are dispersed from one site and relocate in another where human
exposure to concentrations of bird droppings over time occurs, human health and safety threats can occur.
However, WS uses IWDM strategies to address such bird damage in Washington. Such strategies may result
in the implementation of either or both of the following: habitat modifications to problem areas or population
reductions of migratory bird numbers which are causing human health and safety impacts. The potential for
harassment/dispersal and subsequent relocation of flocks of birds to produce cumulative impacts as a result
of their presence in areas of human use is therefore reduced or eliminated by the overall WS IWDM strategy.
Consequently, no cumulative impacts are expected from the use of harassment or other dispersal methods which
might relocate flocks of roosting or feeding migratory birds to other human-occupied sites.
3.6.3 Summary
Cumulative impacts of public actions to control depredating birds in the absence (Section 2.5) or reduced
(Section 2.2 & 2.4) presence of WS can only be speculated upon. However, it is reasonable to expect that as
governmental assistance in resolving wildlife conflicts decreases, independent actions increase. The
environmental desirability of these actions would be dependent upon the individuals who implement them.
Many such actions may be poorly monitored, and public accountability would likely be low. For these reasons,
cumulative impacts to the environment may be expected to increase as WS assistance decreases.
The scope of this proposal and the number of migratory birds that might be removed by WS under any of the
alternatives would result in very low or negligible direct or indirect impacts. WS maintains ongoing contact
with USFWS and WDFW to assure local, state and regional knowledge of wildlife population trends. WS
would have a very low or negligible impact on non-target, sensitive and protected species. This finding is also
made on a national level in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised).
This EA will be reviewed periodically to assure conformance with current environmental regulations and
project scope. Substantial changes in the project scope or changes in environmental regulations may trigger
the requirement for a new or revised EA.
