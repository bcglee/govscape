- What is the population status of the target species? Is it endangered or threatened; or is it relatively
abundant?
- Are there any threatened or endangered or other potential non-target species in the area that could be
affected either directly or indirectly in a positive or negative fashion by using the method?
- Are there any special behavioral traits of the target species, such as daily or seasonal movement
patterns, that require consideration?
- Could the use of the method potentially affect biological diversity?
Physical Environment
- What effect would local weather or climatic patterns have on the use of the method?
- What effect would soil, water, air, elevation, or other physical habitat features have on the use of the
method?
- What effect would the method have on soil, water, and air quality?
- What health and safety risks would the method pose to the applicator and the public?
- What health and safety risks would be posed to the public by not conducting control using the method?
Economic Environment
- Would the use of the method in this situation be likely to reduce damage?
- Does the magnitude of damage warrant the cost of applying the method?
Sociocultural Environment
Evaluating methods in the sociocultural environment frequently presents the greatest challenge because of
differences in human attitudes toward wildlife species (Kellert 1976; Decker and Goff 1987), wildlife damage
management methods (Stuby et al. 1979; Arthur 1981), and the resources damaged by wildlife (Connolly 1982).
In spite of the difficulties associated with evaluating methods in the sociocultural environment, societal values
are important in decision-making and they deserve similar consideration in methods evaluation as the other
environmental factors. Some important sociocultural issues to consider in evaluating wildlife damage control
methods include:
- What are the perceptions regarding the humaneness of the method?
- How acceptable would the risks of this method to non-target animals be to the resource manager or
affected party and the general public?
- How acceptable is the effect of each method on the target animal–no effect, frighten, exclude, modify
habitat, translocate, or kill–to the resource manager or affected party and the general public?
The methods evaluation should result in one or more methods available for further consideration in formulating
a control strategy (Figure 2-5). However, as a function of this evaluation it is possible to determine that there
are no practical methods available. This results in no action being recommended or taken.
Formulate Wildlife Damage Control Strategy
At this decision step, those control methods determined to be practical from the previous evaluation are
formulated into a control strategy for the specific problem. In determining the sequence or combination of
methods to be applied and who will apply them, preference is given to practical non-lethal methods. However,
this does not mean that non-lethal methods must always be applied as a first response to each damage problem.
