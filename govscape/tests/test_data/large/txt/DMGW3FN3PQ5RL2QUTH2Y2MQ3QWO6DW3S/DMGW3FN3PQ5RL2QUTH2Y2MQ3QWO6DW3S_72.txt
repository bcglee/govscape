identification of target animals. The listed species are easily distinguishable from depredating birds, as defined, and only
rarely occur in the environments where project activities would be likely to occur. The capture drug, AC, would be used in
accordance with FDA label requirements (copy attached). WS personnel are trained and certified in the use of AC. AC is
administered by hand baiting, which allows for controlled delivery to target birds. Any uneaten baits are gathered and
removed. No secondary impacts of the drug to predatory or scavenging species such as bald eagles are expected, because
drugged birds are captured and removed. The pesticide, DRC-1339, would be used in accordance with EPA label
requirements (copy of label attached). Baits are not applied in areas accessible to threatened and endangered species or other
non-target wildlife, and bait consumption is visually monitored to reduce risk to non-target animals. Any uneaten baits are
removed. The risk of secondary hazards to predatory or scavenging wildlife are extremely low. The 1992 USDI Biological
Opinion regarding USDA-ADC program activities determined danger to raptors or mammalian carnivores that might eat
DRC-1339 poisoned birds was minimal (Appendix P, USDA 1997). WS personnel are trained in the use of pesticides and
are certified by the Washington Department of Agriculture. Unattended scare devices, such as gas operated exploders, could
unintentionally frighten a listed species. However, such occurrences would be extremely rare and there would be no physical
or long term behavioral consequences.
Based on these findings, this project is not likely to adversely affect the behavior or biology of any listed threatened and
endangered species. We seek your concurrence with our determination.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
