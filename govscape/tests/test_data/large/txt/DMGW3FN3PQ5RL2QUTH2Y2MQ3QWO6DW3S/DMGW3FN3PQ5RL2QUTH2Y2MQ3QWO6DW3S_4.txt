1.0 PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION
The purpose of this Environmental Assessment (EA) is to evaluate the issues and alternatives for the
management of migratory bird damage and to develop future management options for the State of Washington.
1.1 NEPA Compliance
This EA has been prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42
United States Code (USC) Section 4231 et seq., as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) Regulations, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 1500 - 1508]. According to APHIS
procedures implementing NEPA, individual wildlife damage management actions are categorically excluded
from the requirement to prepare an EA [7 CFR 372.5 (c), 60 Fed Reg. 6,000 - 6,003, 1995]. However, to
facilitate planning, interagency consultation, comply with Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
NEPA procedures, and involve the public in resolving migratory bird damage in Washington, WS has elected
to prepare this EA.
An EA is a concise public document for which a Federal agency is responsible that serves to:
(1) Briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI).
(2) Aid an agency’s compliance with the NEPA when no EIS is necessary.
(3) Facilitate preparation of an EIS when one is necessary.
(4) Provide brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by Section 102(2)(E),
of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and
persons consulted (40 CFR 1508.9).
WS, formerly known as Animal Damage Control (ADC), has issued a Final EIS on the national APHIS-WS
program (USDA 1997, revised) to which this EA is tiered. In addition, pertinent and current information
available in the Final EIS has been incorporated by reference into this EA.
1.2 Introduction
USDA-APHIS-Wildlife Services (WS) is authorized by Congress to manage a program to reduce
human/wildlife conflicts. WS’s mission is to “provide leadership in wildlife damage management in the
protection of America’s agricultural, industrial and natural resources, and to safeguard public health and
safety”. This is accomplished through:
A) training of wildlife damage management professionals;
B) development and improvement of strategies to reduce economic losses and threats to humans from
wildlife;
C) collection, evaluation, and dissemination of management information;
D) participating in cooperative wildlife damage management programs;
E) informing and educating the public on how to reduce wildlife damage and;
F) providing data and a source for limited-use management materials and equipment, including pesticides
(USDA 1989).
WS is a cooperatively funded and service oriented program. Before any operational wildlife damage
management is conducted, Agreements for Control or WS Work Plans must be completed by WS and the land
owner/administrator. WS cooperates with private property owners and managers and with appropriate land
and wildlife management agencies, as requested, with the goal of effectively and efficiently resolving wildlife
damage problems with all applicable federal and state permits.
