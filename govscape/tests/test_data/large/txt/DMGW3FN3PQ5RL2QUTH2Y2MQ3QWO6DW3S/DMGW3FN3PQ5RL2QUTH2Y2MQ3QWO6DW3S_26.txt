3.2.5 Aesthetics of migratory birds
WS would have no impact on aesthetic values, because it would not be actively involved. However, individuals
experiencing damage may affect aesthetic values depending on the extent of bird removal. A public over-
harvest of target or non-target species could reduce viewing opportunities, or a lack of effectiveness could lead
to a degradation of aesthetics caused by increased bird damage.
3.3 Impact of Lethal Control and Technical Assistance only Alternative
3.3.1 Effectiveness of control measures in reducing or minimizing damage
The effectiveness of control measures under this alternative may be decreased compared to the Current
Program. Non-lethal measures would not be implemented by WS and birds causing damage would be
immediately removed. Because an integrated approach is typically more effective than any single method, by
not employing effective non-lethal control measures damage may increase. Management objectives set by the
USFWS and WDFW may not allow large-scale removal efforts, and lethal control is not always possible at
some locations for various reasons, thus reducing the effectiveness.
3.3.2 Impact on non-targets, including Threatened and Endangered Species
Impacts on non-targets, including T&E species would be similar to the Current Program (3.1.2). The risk of
non-target take may increase due to the exclusive use of lethal methods. Under Section 3 of the ESA, the
definition of ‘Take’ as it refers to T&E species means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,
capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. It is expected that under Alternative 3, the
likelihood of T&E species being harassed may increase.
3.3.3 Impact on target species
It would be expected that the impact of Alternative 3 would be greater on target populations than under the
Current Program. Because fewer birds would be hazed, it may be assumed that more birds would be
taken under the Lethal Control Only Alternative. WS would continue to coordinate with appropriate state and
federal agencies (Section 1.5 and 1.6) to ensure that take would not cause populations to fall below minimum
population thresholds.
3.3.4 Humaneness of control methods
Because non-lethal methods are such a critical element of IWDM, the humaneness of the control methods
under this alternative would be considered less humane than the Current Program Alternative (3.1.4).
Some people would believe that the exclusive use of lethal methods without any regard to non-lethal
methods would be less humane. Others, however, may believe that by using lethal control early, before
birds overpopulate, fewer birds would be killed in the long term, thus, be more humane than the Current
Program.
3.3.5 Aesthetics of migratory birds
In limited or isolated areas where control work is conducted, populations of target bird species may be
brought to a level where viewing opportunities would be reduced, but there would be less unsightly bird-
caused damage.
