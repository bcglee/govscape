Dear Ms. Allen,
The purpose of this letter is to request an informal consultation and concurrence of findings for listed and proposed
threatened and endangered species that may be present within Washington State. Based on a review of the listings provided
by your office, I have analyzed the potential impact of the program alternatives proposed in the Wildlife Services’
Environmental Assessment (EA) for the management of damage caused by migratory birds in Washington.
Project Area
This EA evaluates alternative methods to resolve conflicts with migratory birds that include, but are not necessarily limited
to: gulls [California (Larus californicus), glaucous-winged (L. glaucescens), herring (L. argentatus), and ring-billed (L.
delawarensis)]; cormorants (Phalacrocorax species); waterfowl (Anatidae family); hawks and falcons (Accipitridae and
Falconidae families); owls [great horned (Bubo virginianus) and barn (Tyto alba)]; house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus);
northern flickers (Colaptes auratus); herons (Ardeidae family); swallows (Hirundinidae family); and American robins
(Turdus migratorius) in Washington State.
Federally Listed
The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus
marmoratus), northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and western snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus
nivosus) may occur in project areas.
State Listed
The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife designates eight additional threatened or endangered species which WS
has determined to deserve consideration relative to our proposed action. They include: the American white pelican
(Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), Aleutian Canada goose (Branta canadensis leucopareia), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis),
peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus
phasianellus), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), and the upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda).
Proposed Action and Methods
The proposed action would include WS direct control and technical assistance applied on a case-by-case basis to use the
most appropriate, effective and biologically sound methods available. This approach is known as Integrated Wildlife
Damage Management and is analyzed and discussed in Chapter 1, 1-7 of the Animal Damage Control Program, Final
Environmental Impact Statement (USDA 1997). Direct control conducted by WS may include harassment, exclusion, cage
traps, capture and relocation, capture and euthanasia, and shooting. The capture drug, alpha chloralose (AC), and the
avicide, DRC-1339, may also be used.
Findings
Upon careful review, I have determined that the proposed project would have little or no effect on listed threatened and
endangered species, candidate species, and species of concern. Capture and removal methods would allow for positive
