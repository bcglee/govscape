Step 5. Provide Assistance
WS’ role was that of providing damage assessment, technical assistance, monitoring, and to loan frightening
equipment. The WS representative communicated with concerned parties to provide details for
implementing control techniques and bird identification. An operational program was conducted by airport
employees, contractors, and WS’ personnel.
An Agreement for Control on Non-Private Property was completed. The agreement authorized control
activities on the property and described the control methods to be used. WS also contracted with the airport
to conduct an ecological study to identify wildlife hazards and bird flight corridors on the airport under a
cooperative funding agreement. Direct control services provided by WS personnel were (1) aid in the
development and implementation of a WHMP, (2) hazing and harassment of gulls using the AOA, and (3)
shooting of persistent gulls entering the AOA.
Step 6. Monitor and Evaluate Results of Control Actions
WS and airport personnel lethally removed 200 glaucous-winged gulls and hazed nearly 62,000 individual
gulls during the first six months. For every gull that was lethally removed, 310 were hazed. Because 1,500
glaucous-winged gulls were counted during the initial visit to the roost, it was suspected that the same birds
were being hazed on a daily basis. WS and airport personnel continually monitored gull activity around the
airfield and at the roost to verify implementation of the selected control method, control method effectiveness,
and need for additional WS assistance.
Step 7. End of Project
The number and frequency of gulls attempting to use the AOA had decreased substantially after twelve
months of control operations. The problem of gulls crossing the AOA had been greatly reduced and no new
gull-strikes or near-misses had occurred. Because gulls will continue to present a health and safety concern
when they enter the AOA, and other wildlife species are likely to pose similar threats, this project may be
expanded. A project is considered completed for WS whenever program personnel are no longer directly
involved in control activity for that specific problem. This type of project has no well-defined end point.
See Appendix N in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised) for more examples of the
WS Decision Model.
Comment 13. WS has confirmed none of the reported damage, accepting on faith the producers’
estimates of their financial losses. If damage is not even reported to the program, much less confirmed,
WS cannot use its suspicion that it occurred to justify the action it proposes.
The wording used in the EA to differentiate between ‘Reported’ and ‘Verified’ dollar damage data was
insufficient, and in one case (page 5), incorrect. On page 5, paragraph 4 begins with, “Total migratory bird
damage reported to WS in WA for fiscal year....”, and now reads, “Total migratory bird damage reported
and verified by WS in WA for fiscal year....”. The Need for Action does not only take into account damages
reported to WS, but damages verified by trained WS personnel as well.
On page 6 under the subsection, Accumulation of Droppings, the wording, “Between FY 1996-2000, WS
received reports of droppings...”, now reads, “Between FY 1996-2000, WS recorded droppings...”
On page 6 under the subsection, Crop Damage, the wording, “Losses reported by farmers to WS in FY 1999
totaled....”, now reads, “Losses reported by farmers and verified by WS in FY 1999 totaled....” Also on
page 6 under the same subsection, the sentence, “Between FY 1996-2000, WS recorded a total of...”, is
relating to both verified and reported damage information.
