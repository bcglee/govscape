(7) A training program to provide airport personnel with the knowledge and skills needed to carry out
the wildlife hazard management plan required by paragraph (d) of this section.
(f) Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, each certificate holder shall take immediate
measures to alleviate wildlife hazards whenever they are detected.
(g) FAA Advisory Circulars in the 150 series contain standards and procedures for wildlife hazard
management at airports which are acceptable to the Administrator.
Guidance from Part 139 handbook.
The FAA must determine that the airport operator has adequate procedures in place to take immediate
action to alleviate wildlife hazards whenever they are detected. During an airport inspection, if the FAA
feels that wildlife activity on or in the vicinity of the airport constitutes a wildlife hazard, the need for an
ecological study must be addressed in a Letter of Correction. The airport operator shall consult with
USDA and follow their direction in conducting the study and developing a Wildlife Hazard Management
Plan (WHMP) if necessary.
If a WHMP is already in place, the following items will be reviewed:
(a) The plan's effectiveness in dealing with the wildlife hazard.
(b) Indications that the wildlife hazard described in the ecological survey, should be reevaluated.
(c) Training of personnel with responsibilities in the WHMP.
(d) Accomplishment of procedures outlined in the WHMP, such as inspections prior to air carrier
operations.
(e) Status of habitat modification projects or changes in land use identified in the WHMP.
(f) Existence of current depredation permits, if applicable.
Section 139.337(a)(3) of the regulation can be used by FAA to have an airport operator initiate an
ecological survey if there is an obvious wildlife problem at an airport even though a multiple bird strike,
engine ingestion, or damaging collision had not yet occurred.
When an airport operator requests assistance to conduct an ecological survey, the operator shall notify and
provide copies of all correspondence to the FAA. Upon receipt of survey recommendations, the FAA shall
take action as deemed appropriate.
