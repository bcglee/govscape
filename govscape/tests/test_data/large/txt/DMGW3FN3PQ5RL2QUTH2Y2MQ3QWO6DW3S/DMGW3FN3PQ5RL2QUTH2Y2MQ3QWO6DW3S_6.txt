1.5 Authority and Compliance
Wildlife Services:
WS activities are conducted at the request of and in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies;
private organizations; and individuals. WS is directed by law to protect American agriculture and other
resources from damage associated with wildlife. “Wildlife damage management” is defined as the alleviation
of damage or other problems caused by, or related to, the presence of wildlife. It is an integral component of
wildlife management (Leopold 1933, The Wildlife Society 1990, Berryman 1991). The primary statutory
authority for the WS program is the Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931, as amended (7 U.S.C.
426-426c; 46 Stat. 1468). In 1988, Congress strengthened the legislative authority of WS with the Rural
Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
Consulting Agencies:
United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS):
The Service’s authority for action is based on the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918 (as
amended) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The Department’s authority for managing wildlife in the state of Washington is based on Washington
