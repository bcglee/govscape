Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact
Alternative Strategies for the Management of Damage Caused by Migratory Birds
in the State of Washington
managers, private contractors, and/or other government agencies, and is discussed in detail in the
USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised).
5. Issues
The following migratory bird management issues were identified during the interagency and public
involvement processes. These issues were determined to be important and were used to drive the
environmental analysis.
1. Effectiveness of control measures in reducing or minimizing damage.
2. Impact of control methods on non-target, including Threatened and Endangered species.
3. Impact on the population of migratory birds (target species).
4. Humaneness of control methods. Humaneness is a personâ€™s perception of the impact of an action
on animal pain and suffering, and individuals may perceive the humaneness of an action differently.
5. Aesthetics of migratory birds and the damage they cause.
6. Decision and Rationale
After carefully reviewing the EA, I believe that the need for action and issues identified in the EA are best
addressed by implementing the Current Program Alternative (No Action). The EA analyzed five alternatives
to address migratory bird damage management in Washington State: a continuation of the Current Program;
a Non-lethal and Technical Assistance Only Alternative; a Lethal Control Only Alternative, a Non-lethal
Methods First Alternative; and a No Federal Program Alternative.
The Current Program Alternative allows WS to provide both technical assistance and direct control services
including both non-lethal and lethal management approaches. It allows the use of practical and effective
methods of preventing or controlling damage while minimizing harmful effects of control measures on
humans, other species and the environment. Non-lethal methods would be given first consideration in the
formulation of each damage management strategy, and would be recommended or implemented when
practical and effective before recommending or implementing lethal methods. All wildlife damage
management activities will be conducted in a manner consistent with all applicable environmental regulations
and agency policies.
Environmental Consequences:
Humaneness: The Proposed Action employs the most humane methods available that are also
practical and effective. Lethal control will be used under this alternative, which may be seen as
inhumane by some people. Some people view the capture and killing of birds as inhumane,
regardless of the methods used.
Impacts on non-target, threatened and endangered species: Lethal control methods proposed are
highly target selective. The USFWS has concurred that the Proposed Action is not likely to
adversely affect Federally listed species, including the bald eagle, brown pelican, marbled murrelet,
northern spotted owl, and western snowy plover.
Impacts on target species: The Proposed Action will be likely to reduce localized numbers of birds.
However, there will be no significant impact on the state, regional, or national population level.
