1.6 Compliance with statutes
Several federal laws regulate WS wildlife damage management. WS complies with these laws and regulations,
consults with, reports to, and cooperates with other agencies as appropriate.
National Environmental Policy Act. Environmental documents pursuant to NEPA must be completed before
a NEPA decision can be implemented. WS also coordinates specific projects and programs with other
agencies. The purpose of these contacts is to coordinate any wildlife damage management that may affect
resources managed by these agencies or affect other areas of mutual concern. Typically, federal agencies that
fund WS assistance to protect resources are responsible for NEPA compliance. For example, the USFWS
would be responsible for NEPA compliance regarding efforts conducted by WS at the request of, and funded
by, the USFWS for protection of endangered species.
Endangered Species Act (ESA). It is federal policy, under the ESA, that all federal agencies shall seek to
conserve endangered and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of
the Act (Sec. 2(c)). WS conducts Section 7 consultations with the USFWS to use the expertise of the USFWS
to ensure that “any action authorized, funded or carried out by such an agency. . . is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. . . Each agency shall use the best scientific
and commercial data available” (Sec. 7(a)(2)).
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). The MBTA provides the USFWS regulatory authority to protect
species of birds that migrate outside the United States . The MBTA prohibits the take of protected species
(defined under 50 CFR §10.13) except as permitted by the USFWS under the regulatory authorities of 50 CFR
Parts 13, 20, and 21. WS obtains MBTA permits covering management activities that involve the taking of
species for which such permits are required in accordance with the MBTA and USFWS regulations, or operates
as a named agent on MBTA permits obtained by cooperators.
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). FIFRA requires the registration,
classification, and regulation of all pesticides used in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is responsible for implementing and enforcing FIFRA. All pesticides used by the WS program in
Washington are registered with and regulated by the EPA and Washington State Department of Agriculture,
and used by WS in compliance with labeling procedures and requirements.
Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants permission
to use INAD (21 CFR, Part 511). Alpha chloralose is classified as an INAD (21 CFR 510) and cannot be
purchased from any source except WS. The FDA authorization allows WS to use alpha chloralose to capture
geese, ducks, coots, and pigeons. FDA acceptance of additional data will allow WS to consider requesting an
expansion for the use of alpha chloralose with other species.
Executive Order 12898 Environmental Justice (EO-12898). EO-12898 requires Federal agencies to make
Environmental Justice part of their mission, and to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse
human health and environmental effects of Federal programs, policies and activities on minority and low-
income persons or populations.
Executive Order 13186 Migratory Birds (EO-13186). EO-13186 directs Federal agencies to incorporate
bird conservation considerations into agency planning, including NEPA analyses; reporting annually on the
level of take of migratory birds; and generally promoting the conservation of migratory birds without
compromising the agency mission.
