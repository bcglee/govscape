Dear Mr. Woodruff:
This letter is in response to your request for an informal consultation and concurrence of findings for listed and
proposed threatened and endangered species that may be present within Washington State. You analyzed the potential
impact of the program alternatives proposed in the Wildlife Services' Agency Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) of
Alternative Strategies for the management of damage caused by migratory birds in the State of Washington. The draft
EA evaluates methods to resolve conflicts with migratory birds including gulls, cormorants, waterfowl, hawks and
falcons, owls (great horned and barn), house finches, northern flickers, herons, swallows, and American robins in
Washington state.
Federally listed species that may occur in the project areas include the bald eagle, brown pelican, marbled murrelet,
northern spotted owl, and western snowy plover. Other state listed species include the American white pelican, Aleutian
Canada goose, ferruginous hawk, peregrine falcon, sage grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, sandhill crane, and the upland
sandpiper.
Based on information contained in the draft EA, the Department concurs with your determination-that the proposed
project, as described, is-not-likely to adversely affect the following endangered and threatened species: bald eagle,
brown pelican, marbled murrelet, northern spotted owl, western snowy plover, American white pelican, Aleutian
Canada goose, ferruginous hawk, peregrine falcon, sage grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, sandhill crane, and upland
sandpiper.
Thank you for the opportunity to consult with you on possible effects of the proposed project on listed species in
Washington.
