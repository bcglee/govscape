Figure 2b. A comparison of 2 population trend indices (CBC-BBS). The bird counts in these analyses are index indicators of
population trends, not estimates of total bird populations.
Ring-billed gulls become sexually mature at about
4 years of age and have a life expectancy of Ring-billed gulls
approximately 20 years (Southern 1967 & 1975).

Numbers of breeding birds fluctuate from year to
year, though they have increased overall in the
past 50 years due to dam projects in eastern
Washington (Conover 1983). The CBC (1996- Killed
2000) averages 5,550 ring-billed gulls per year in
the winter and the WOS (1999) has shown this
species to be commonly abundant year-round in 95%

both eastern and western Washington. On Washington by WS (USDA 1995-2000).
average, WS has hazed 67,444 and lethally
removed 3,747 ring-billed gulls per year over the
last 5 years on projects relevant to this EA (Fig. 1d) (USDA 1995-2000). In FY 1998, WS lethally removed
