can occur because of uric acid from bird droppings. Woodpeckers sometimes cause structural damage to wood
siding and stucco on homes, and electric utility companies occasionally have problems with birds causing
power outages by shorting-out transformers and substations. In FY 1996- 2000, WS recorded damage
complaints of $229,900 from droppings, $35,700 in woodpecker damage, and $5,200 from electric utilities.
Landfills are a dependable source of food for gulls, and because they are often located near urban areas, their
increased use by gulls and associated urban nesting has led to a identical increase in conflicts with humans
(Verbeek 1977; Bradley 1980; Burger 1981; Patton 1988; Speich & Wahl 1989; Belant & Dolbeer 1993;
Ryder 1993; Verbeek 1993; Winkler 1996; Belant et al. 1998). The effect of gulls on residents adjacent to
landfill sites can be disheartening, with broken windows, ‘painted’ laundry, noise, littered lawns and shrubbery,
damaged rooftops, and depreciated land value not uncommon (Bradley 1980; USDA 1995-2000). The control
of birds is required as a minimum functional standard for solid waste handling under the Washington
Administrative Code (WAC) 173-304-400 and WAC 173-304-460. In 2000, a King County owned landfill
settled a $16.5 million lawsuit with neighbors over odor, noise, vibration and bird problems (Seattle Post-
Intelligencer 2000; Seattle Times 1999). Bird control at landfills is needed to prevent the spread of diseases
that birds may carry from the landfill to surrounding communities (Belant et al. 1998; Norton 1986; Butterfield
et al. 1983; Mudge & Ferns 1982; Fenlon 1981; Hall & Jones 1978; Williams et al. 1977; Crew 1967). WS
has recorded dollar damage from solid waste and recycling operators of $230,000 in materials and manpower
attributed to gulls and cleaning their droppings from facilities (USDA 1995-2000).
Damage to Natural Resources:
Locally breeding, non-migratory flocks of ducks and geese can host diseases which pose a threat to migrating
waterfowl1 (USDA 1999). Gull predation on the eggs and chicks of other bird species (Verbeek 1993; Ryder
1993; Blokpoel and Tessier 1986) could be of serious concern if that species is sensitive, threatened or
endangered (T&E). Gulls may feed upon young waterfowl and swallows, small songbirds, and T&E species
of salmonids (Winkler 1996; Blokpoel & Tessier 1986; Laymon 1983; York et al. 2000). Because of the
predatory nature of gulls and other migratory birds WS could be requested, in the future, to help control bird
predation on other species, as currently conducted for salmonids on the Columbia River.
2.0 ALTERNATIVES
The following alternative courses of action were identified in responses to the public involvement process and
interagency coordination. No new alternatives were specified during public involvement.
2.1 Alternative 1: Current Program (No Action) Alternative
Alternative 1, the Current Program Alternative, is used as the baseline for comparison with the other
alternatives, therefore, more information and description is provided under this definition and under the analysis
of its possible environmental impacts. Alternative 1 is the “No Action” Alternative. The “No Action”
Alternative is a procedural NEPA requirement (40 CFR 1502.14(d)), and is a viable and reasonable alternative
that could be selected.
Under the Current Program, WS applies direct control (see “direct control”, page 11) and technical assistance
(see “technical assistance”, page 9) on a case-by-case basis. The most appropriate, effective and biologically
sound methods are used to resolve damages caused by migratory birds. This approach is known as Integrated
Wildlife Damage Management (IWDM) and is analyzed and discussed in Chapter 1, 1 - 7 of the USDA-
1“...the American Association of Wildlife Veterinarians encourages local authorities and state and federal agencies to cooperate
to limit the population of waterfowl on urban water areas to prevent disease outbreaks in semi-domestic as well as free-ranging
ducks, geese and swans and discourages the practice of relocating nuisance or excess urban ducks, geese and swans to other parks
or wildlife areas as a means of local population control”.
