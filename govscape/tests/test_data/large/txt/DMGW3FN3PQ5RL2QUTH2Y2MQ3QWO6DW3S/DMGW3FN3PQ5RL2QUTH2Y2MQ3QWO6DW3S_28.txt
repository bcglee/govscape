3.4 Impact of Exhaust All Non-lethal Before Lethal Methods Are Considered Alternative
3.4.1 Effectiveness of control measures in reducing or minimizing damage
The effectiveness of control measures under this alternative may be decreased compared to the Current
Program, because lethal methods may be inappropriately delayed. The delayed application of what may be
the most appropriate method could result in more damage to property, agriculture, natural resources, and
human health and safety. Such delay could increase the potential for tragic consequences where human health
and safety are at risk.
3.4.2 Impact on non-targets, including Threatened and Endangered Species
Impacts on non-targets, including T&E species, would be similar to the Current Program Alternative (3.1.2).
3.4.3 Impact on target species
It would be expected that the impact of Alternative 4 would be similar to the Current Program (3.1.3). This
is based on the expectation that lethal methods used under the Current Program are used only when non-lethal
methods have already been used, or are not expected to be effective. Also, since the Current Program has had
no observed impact on target species, there would be no reason to expect that Alternative 4 would either.
3.4.4 Humaneness of control methods
The humaneness of the control methods under this alternative would be comparable to the Current Program
Alternative (3.1.4). However, some people would believe that exhausting all non-lethal methods before using
lethal methods would be more humane than the Current Program. Others would believe that unnecessarily
delaying lethal control would result in the removal of more birds, and thus, be less humane than the Current
Program.
3.4.5 Aesthetics of migratory birds
Analysis of aesthetics would be similar to those discussed under the Current Program Alternative (3.1.5), based
on the lack of impacts on target species.
3.5 Impact of No Federal Program Alternative
3.5.1 Effectiveness of control measures in reducing or minimizing damage.
WS would have no effect on reducing damage. Taking no action could reasonably be expected to be the least
effective of all of the alternatives examined in this EA. WS would not be providing technical assistance or
direct control.
3.5.2 Possible impact on non-target, Threatened, and Endangered Species
This Alternative would result in no impact by WS. The impact of others would be unknown but may be greater
than the Current Program (3.1.2). WS would offer no technical assistance on appropriate methods of wildlife
damage management to avoid impacts on non-target and T&E species. It is possible that frustration caused
by an inability to reduce losses could lead to the misapplication of methods and the illegal use of chemicals,
causing negative impacts on non-target, threatened, and endangered species.
3.5.3 Impact on target species
WS would have no impact on target species populations. It would be expected that the impact of Alternative
5 would be similar to Alternative 2 (3.2.3); WS would not impact populations but individuals may. WS would
offer no technical assistance on appropriate and effective methods of wildlife damage management. It is
possible that frustration caused by an inability for individuals to reduce losses could lead to the misapplication
of methods and the illegal use of chemicals, causing negative impacts on target bird populations.
