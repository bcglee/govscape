FAA Legislative Authority
The FAAâ€™s authority for wildlife hazard management at airports throughout the United States is based on
14 CFR Part 139, requiring certificated airports having a wildlife hazard problem to develop and
implement a wildlife hazard management plan to manage and control wildlife which present a risk to public
safety caused by aircraft collisions with wildlife.
139.337 Wildlife hazard management.
(a) Each certificate holder shall provide for the conduct of an ecological study, acceptable to the
Administrator, when any of the following events occurs on or near the airport:
(1) An air carrier aircraft experiences a multiple bird strike or engine ingestion.
(2) An air carrier aircraft experiences a damaging collision with wildlife other than birds.
(3) Wildlife of a size or in numbers capable of causing an event described in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of
this section is observed to have access to any airport flight pattern or movement area.
(b) The study required in paragraph (a) of this section shall contain at least the following:
(1) Analysis of the event which prompted the study.
(2) Identification of the species, numbers, locations, local movements, and daily and seasonal
occurrences of wildlife observed.
(3) Identification and location of features on and near the airport that attract wildlife.
(4) Description of the wildlife hazard to air carrier operations.
(c) The study required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator, who
determines whether or not there is a need for a wildlife hazard management plan. In reaching this
determination, the Administrator considers -
(1) The ecological study;
(2) The aeronautical activity at the airport;
(3) The views of the certificate holder;
(4) The views of the airport users; and
(5) Any other factors bearing on the matter of which the Administrator is aware.
(d) When the Administrator determines that a wildlife hazard management plan is needed, the certificate
holder shall formulate and implement a plan using the ecological study as a basis. The plan shall -
(1) Be submitted to, and approved by, the Administrator prior to implementation; and
(2) Provide measures to alleviate or eliminate wildlife hazards to air carrier operations.
(e) The plan shall include at least the following:
(1) The persons who have authority and responsibility for implementing the plan.
(2) Priorities for needed habitat modification and changes in land use identified in the ecological study,
with target dates for completion.
(3) Requirements for and, where applicable, copies of local, state, and Federal wildlife control permits.
(4) Identification of resources to be provided by the certificate holder for implementation of the plan.
(5) Procedures to be followed during air carrier operations, including at least -
(i) Assignment of personnel responsibilities for implementing the procedures;
(ii) Conduct of physical inspections of the movement area and other areas critical to wildlife hazard
management sufficiently in advance of air carrier operations to allow time for wildlife controls to be
effective;
(iii) Wildlife control measures; and
(iv) Communication between the wildlife control personnel and any air traffic control tower in
operation at the airport.
(6) Periodic evaluation and review of the wildlife hazard management plan for -
(i) Effectiveness in dealing with the wildlife hazard; and
(ii) Indications that the existence of the wildlife hazard, as previously described in the ecological
study, should be reevaluated.
