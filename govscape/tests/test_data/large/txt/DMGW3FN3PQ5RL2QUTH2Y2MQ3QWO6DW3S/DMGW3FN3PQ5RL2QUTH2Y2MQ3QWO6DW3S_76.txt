Alternative Strategies for the Management of Damage Caused by Migratory Birds
in the State of Washington
1. Introduction
The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS),
Wildlife Services (WS) works cooperatively with Federal, state, and local governments, public and private
organizations and individuals to reduce wildlife caused damage and conflicts. WS’s authority comes from
the Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931, as amended, and pursuant to the Rural Development,
Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988. WS completed an Environmental
Assessment (EA) on September 14, 2001 for the State of Washington. The EA analyzed potential impacts of
a proposed program and alternatives to manage conflicts associated with migratory birds.
WS’ Proposed Action is to continue the present migratory bird damage management program in
Washington State (Current Program Alternative) in order to provide assistance to a diversity of requesters
which may include Federal, State, and Local government agencies; industry; other businesses, or individuals;
and to cooperate with appropriate land and wildlife management agencies to seek resolution involving
migratory bird damage related to agriculture, property, human health and safety, and natural resources.
2. Public Involvement
Solicitation for Input, Information, and Issues:
WS used the information gathered from agency personnel, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW),
National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and
the public in preparing this document. Public input was obtained through written comments provided in
response to a public involvement letter. Three hundred and five public involvement letters were sent to state,
federal, county, and municipal agencies, businesses, environmental groups, animal welfare and animal rights
organizations, and individuals. The public involvement letter invited information concerning the issues and
alternatives involving bird damage caused by the species addressed in this EA. Two letters were received in
response to the invitations.
A Predecisional Document for Public Review was prepared and released to the public for a 30-day comment
period on July 27, 2001. Fifty-seven letters were received in response to this document, eight of which were
received after the 30-day comment period. Forty-seven of the responses were “form” letters. Only two of
the fifty-seven commenters had requested copies of the Pre-decisional EA. The issues and alternatives
identified throughout the public involvement process have been considered in the final document. None of
the public comments on the predecisional EA brought up substantive new issues or alternatives, or new
information that would change the analysis. A summary of the public comments along with WS’ responses
is attached.
Public notice of Availability:
Legal notices of availability were placed in; The Seattle Times, The Wenatchee World, The Tri-City
Herald, The Columbian and The Spokesman Review to solicit input on the pre-decisional EA.
Agency Review:
Agency input was used throughout the process. A preliminary draft of the EA and the Predecisional
Document for Public Review were presented to the consulting agencies (USFWS, FAA, WDFW, and
WSDA) for interagency review and comment.
