WS receives a request for assistance from an airport manager and the FAA, reporting that a glaucous-
winged gull was involved in a bird-strike and many gulls have been seen crossing the runways on a regular
basis.
Step 2. Assess Problem
A WS Specialist considered the following types of questions during the initial evaluation:
- Is the problem within the purview of WS?
- Where exactly did the damage occur?
- Is a cooperative agreement in effect for WS to provide control assistance for this type of problem
in this area?
- Does WS have expert personnel available to visit the damage site to confirm the damage,
formulate control strategy, and carry out the action?
- Who can provide more information? Where and when can WS personnel contact them?
- What is the history of gull activity at the airport?
- What risks or damages have been identified with gull usage of the airport?
The results of the assessment follow:
a) Type of damage - The pilot of an air carrier reported striking three birds on a landing approach to a
runway. No injuries occurred, and only minor damage to the air carrier was reported by the pilot. An
accident report was filed with the FAA Regional Office, and an ecological study was scheduled to begin, as
required under FAR 139.337. Two other near-miss air strikes with birds had been reported by the airport
manager.
b) Location - The bird-strike occurred on a landing approach at an altitude of 50 feet. The other near-misses
occurred at mid-field during two separate take-offs, both in the morning. Gulls have been reported crossing
the runways at similar locations and altitudes.
c) Site Visit - A survey by a WS Specialist of the airport and surrounding area revealed that gulls used the
airspace around the airport to move between roosting and feeding areas in the morning and evening. Air
traffic safety was the primary concern. The airport was a major hub for international and domestic flights
and supported over 250,000 aircraft operations per year.
d) Responsible Species - The roosting colony consisted of 1,500 glaucous-winged gulls. On average, 10
gulls would be crossing into the Aircraft-Operations-Area (AOA) every three minutes during the peak hours
of movement, just before sunrise and one hour before sunset.
e) Previous Control - The airport had netted water detention ponds and applied porcupine wire to light poles
and ledges used for loafing and roosting. Although gulls had occasionally frequented the airfield, their
numbers and frequency had been low.
f) Assessment - This problem was within the purview of WS. WS agreed to provide assistance.
