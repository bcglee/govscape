3.6.1 Cumulative impact potential from chemical methods
Migratory bird damage management projects which include lethal population management components using
avicides may have the greatest potential for cumulative impacts on the environment, as such impacts relate to
deposit of chemical residues in the physical environment and environmental toxicosis.
The avicide DRC-1339 Concentrate - Gulls (EPA #56228-17) is the only chemical used in the Washington
WS program for the purpose of obtaining lethal effects on gulls. This chemical has been evaluated for possible
residual effects which might occur from buildup of the chemicals in soil, water, or other environmental sites.
DRC-1339 exhibits a low persistence in soil or water, and bio-accumulation of the chemical is unlikely (USDA
1997). In addition, the relatively small quantity of DRC-1339 used in migratory bird damage management in
Washington (140grams in the last 5 years), the chemical’s instability which results in speedy degradation of
the product (See Appendix 5), and application protocol used in WS projects further reduces the likelihood of
any environmental accumulation. DRC-1339 is not used by any other entities in Washington.
The immobilizing agent, AC, is a central nervous system depressant currently registered to capture and remove
nuisance waterfowl, American coots (Fulica americana) and pigeons (Columbia livia). AC is regulated by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and WS is authorized to use AC under the Investigational New
Animal Drug Registration (INAD 6602). WS personnel are trained and certified in its use, and are present at
the site of application during baiting to retrieve the immobilized birds and unconsumed baits. Bio-accumulation
in plants and animal tissue is believed to be low. The compound is slowly metabolized, with recovery occurring
a few hours after administration (Schafer 1991). Toxicity to aquatic organisms is unknown (Woronecki et al.
1990) but the compound is not generally soluble in water and therefore should remain unavailable to aquatic
organisms. Factors supporting the determination of this low potential included the lack of exposure to pets,
non-target species and the public, and the low toxicity of the active ingredient. Other supporting rationale for
this determination included relatively low total annual use and a limited number of potential exposure
pathways.
Based on use patterns, chemical and physical characteristics of avicides and immobilizing agents used in
Washington, and factors related to environmental fate of DRC-1339 and AC, very low or negligible impacts
are expected from these chemical components used in the WS migratory bird damage management program.
3.6.2 Cumulative impact potential from non-chemical methods
Non-chemical methods of the WS program in Washington may include the recommendation of exclusion
through the use of various barriers, habitat modification, harassment, shooting, capture and translocation or
euthanasia. Because shooting is one component of the non-chemical WS program in Washington, the
deposition of lead shot in the environment is a factor considered in this EA.
Threats of lead toxicosis to waterfowl from the deposition of lead shot in waters where such species fed were
observed more than one hundred years ago (Sanderson and Belrose 1986). As a result of discoveries made
regarding impacts to several species of ducks and geese, Federal restrictions were placed on the use of lead shot
for waterfowl hunting in 1991. Regulations regarding this are found in 50CFR20.21.
On some projects, WS sometimes finds it necessary to shoot waterfowl under existing permits granted by
USFWS, usually in airport wildlife hazard management programs where ducks or geese near aircraft operations
jeopardize air passenger safety. If such activities are conducted near or over water, WS uses steel shot during
activities. Consequently, no deposition of lead in nontoxic shot zones occurs as a result of WS’ projects in
Washington. No cumulative impacts are expected therefore, related to toxic shot and shooting as a method in
the Washington WS program. In addition, WS will evaluate other wildlife damage management actions which
