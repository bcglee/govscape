to effect migratory bird populations at the regional or national scale.
California gull: California gulls (Larus
californicus) are distributed north to south from
the Northwest and Nunavut Territory, Canada, to C alifo r nia g ull
Mono Lake and south San Francisco Bay, 18%
California, and from the Dakotas in the east to
the Pacific Ocean (Winkler 1996). The breeding
Hazed
population in Washington was 138,000 pairs in
1980 (Conover 1983), with both sexes becoming
sexually mature at 4 years of age. Average life

expectancy is unknown, but the oldest band
recovered bird was 27 years old. The annual
adult survival is 92% for sub-adults and 75%-
82%
79% for adults (Winkler 1996).
The Washington Ornithological Society (WOS) (1999) has shown the California gull to be a year-round
resident of Washington. On average, WS has hazed 3,962 and lethally removed 848 California gulls per year
over the last 5 years on WSâ€™ projects relevant to
this EA (Fig. 1a) (USDA 1995-2000).

Washington was 18,500 pairs in the late 1980's

The glaucous-winged gull population has steadily

increased in numbers, particularly in urban areas,
over the last few decades (Verbeek 1993; Eddy
1982). Both glaucous-winged gull and glaucous-winged gull x western gull (Larus occidentalis) hybrid data
was combined to form the CBC index in Figure 2a. This species is known to hybridize with western gulls in
northern Oregon and Washington, although to what extent is unknown, and resulting hybrids are often difficult
to identify (Verbeek 1993). The WOS (1999) has shown the glaucous-winged gull to be a common species
throughout western Washington all year long. WS has addled 552 eggs, hazed 101,247 and lethally removed
327 glaucous-winged gulls on average per year over the last 5 years on projects relevant to this EA (Fig. 1b)
(USDA 1995-2000).
Herring gull: Herring gulls (Larus argentatus) are distributed from the Atlantic coast, north to Baffin Island
and throughout arctic Canada into eastern Alaska. From Alaska, their range expands south along the Pacific
coast, Baja Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico. The population in Washington is largely migratory, with an
average life expectancy of 15-20 years (Kadlec 1976) and annual adult survival of 80-85% (Coulson &
Butterfield 1986).
