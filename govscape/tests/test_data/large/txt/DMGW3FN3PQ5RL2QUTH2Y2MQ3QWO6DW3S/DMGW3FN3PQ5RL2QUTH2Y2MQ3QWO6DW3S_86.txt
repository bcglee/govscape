situation is unique, and must take into account environmental, legal and administrative considerations,
among many others. Non-lethal methods are inconspicuously integrated into almost every lethal control
action. Although a lethal method such as shooting may be used over non-lethal (pyrotechnics), a non-lethal
method (a loud noise) is being generated simultaneously with the lethal control action, thereby hazing other
birds within the vicinity of the control action. See Comment 12 for an example of the decision-making
process used under the WS Decision Model.
Comment 6. In Table 2, there is no discussion of how numbers of birds hazed are determined. Were
the same gulls hazed again and again?
WS attempts to record every bird hazed. For example, if a gull were to return to a site four times and was
hazed in each instance, WS would record four gulls hazed.
Comment 7. What was the percentage of birds of each species killed and hazed out of the total
population encountered?
The total population encountered (FY 1996-2000) is depicted through pie charts in Figures 1A, 1B, 1C, and
1D and in the text of Section 3.1.3. For example, the average number of California gulls hazed and killed
per year over the last 5 years was 3,962 and 848, respectively (EA, pg 14). On average, the total population
encountered per year over the last 5 years would be the summation of the birds hazed and killed, which
comes to 4,810 California gulls. The total population encountered is likely to be overestimated because gulls
are repeatedly hazed (See Comment 6).
It is the responsibility of the USFWS and WDFW to estimate wildlife populations, and comment 9 provides
further discussion on WS’ impact on bird populations in Washington.
Comment 8. The numbers given in Table 2 do not correspond to the Depredation Control reports
provided to the USFWS for the period 1996-2000.
WS reports on a fiscal year which goes from September 1, through October 31. The USFWS reports on a
calendar year, and therefore the USFWS Depredation Permit will contain data from two different fiscal years
for WS. Secondly, Table 2 is not a representation of the lethal removal, or take, of migratory birds on
projects which lie outside the scope of this EA. Those impacts are discussed under Cumulative Impacts
(Section 3.6). For example, when the cooperator is another federal agency, NEPA becomes the
responsibility of the cooperator, and WS includes the take of those migratory birds in the Cumulative
Impacts section (3.6), rather than Table 2.
The writer of comment 8 also discusses the absence of red-winged blackbirds, European starlings, and rock
doves from the analysis. A FONSI has been written for these species (Section 1.4). The Final EA and
FONSI and Decision for Bird Damage Management (As associated with ‘depredating’ nonnative (invasive)
birds, feral domestic waterfowl, nonmigratory birds, and those migratory birds as provided for in 50 CFR
Regulations in the State of Washington) is available to the public upon request.
Comment 9. The population trend analyses presented in Figures 2a-f are useless for determining the
effect or the effectiveness of the Current Program.
WS would agree that these data do not determine the effectiveness of the program. Figures 2a-f are used to
show population trends (page 13). When scientifically sound population estimates are lacking, it is common
practice for management agencies to use population trend analyses to determine if species populations are
‘increasing’, ‘stable’, or ‘decreasing’. These data provide an index with which to compare ‘take’ data to
