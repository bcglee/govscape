APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised). In general terms, IWDM is comprised of all the methods
available to resolve a particular wildlife problem. These methods include recommending the alteration of
cultural practices as well as habitat and behavioral modification to prevent damage. Appendix 2 lists the WS
wildlife damage management methods that apply to this EA. The control of wildlife damage may also require
that the offending animal(s) be removed or that local populations of the offending species be reduced through
lethal methods. WS control methods are employed only when requested and funded. Methods are implemented
at the field level through a decision making process known as the WS Decision Model (Appendix 3). The
magnitude, geographic extent, frequency, and duration of the problem are used to determine if action is
warranted. The WS’ National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) is active in the development of new and
improved wildlife damage management methods; as new methods are developed they are incorporated into the
Current Program2.
Technical Assistance:
WS provides technical assistance to the public through verbal or written advice, recommendations,
demonstrations and training, and distributes literature and materials for others to use in managing bird
problems. Technical assistance is usually provided following a verbal consultation or an on-site visit to
determine the nature and history of the problem, extent of damage, and identification of the species responsible
for damage.
From 1996 through 2000, WS provided technical assistance over 1,300 times regarding the migratory bird
species addressed in this EA. Over 50% of this assistance was gull related. In addition, WS loaned or issued
at no charge a wide range of hazing and frightening devices. These included flagging, mylar tape, propane
exploders, pyrotechnics, scarecrows, and effigies (USDA 1995-2000). For large or ongoing projects, WS
typically requests that people purchase supplies or equipment directly from vendors.
Assistance may be given to identify the responsible wildlife species and determine the extent of damage. WS
personnel most frequently suggest non-lethal techniques in resolving conflicts with migratory birds. WS may
provide recommendations concerning habitat modification, removal of attractants, changes in cultural practices,
behavior modification of the species, or ways to reduce specific wildlife populations to control the amount of
damage they cause (see Appendix 2). Explanation of the biology, behavior, and population ecology of the
species responsible for damage is occasionally sufficient to satisfy the resource owner’s information needs and
may result in no damage control actions being taken by WS.
WS gives lectures and demonstrations to property owners and other interested groups and frequently
cooperates with other agencies in education and public information efforts. Additionally, technical papers are
presented at professional meetings and conferences so that WS personnel, other wildlife professionals, and the
public are updated on developments in wildlife damage management technology, laws, regulations, and agency
policies.
At times, WS may recommend lethal control. In these instances, information is provided regarding the legal
status of the species, permits required, the appropriate regulatory agencies, and the legal and responsible
methods of control, including their biological and environmental impacts. Recipients of WS technical
assistance are responsible for the implementation of recommended control actions. The WS program has no
regulatory authority or control of the actions, if any, taken by others.
2. The WS’ NWRC is headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado and operates eight field stations across the United States. NWRC
is responsible for the research and development of biologically sound methods of wildlife damage management. It is staffed by
scientists from a range of disciplines including: animal behavior, veterinary medicine, wildlife biology, physiology, ornithology,
mammalogy, zoology, chemistry, and statistics.
