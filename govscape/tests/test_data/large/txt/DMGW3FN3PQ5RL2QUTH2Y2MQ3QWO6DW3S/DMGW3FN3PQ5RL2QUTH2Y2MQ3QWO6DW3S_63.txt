continuation of the strategy or reevaluation may be in order, as represented by the feedback loop shown in

End of Project
A project is considered completed for APHIS ADC whenever program personnel are no longer directly involved
in control activity for that specific problem. For many projects that are addressed through technical assistance
alone, APHIS ADC involvement in the project ends when the recommendations or advice is provided to those
making the request. Some direct control projects, such as the removal of a single family of beaver and the -
associated dams responsible for flooding a road or dispersing blackbirds from an urban roost, have well-defined
end points. Other projects, such as chronic predation on livestock or at aquaculture facilities, may require
continuing attention at various times of the year. These types of projects have no well-defined end points.
