The WS Specialist evaluated the potential damage control methods (see list below) to determine which
methods were applicable. The basis for selection or rejection of the control methods and the results of the
evaluation follow.
Potential Damage Control Method Basis for Selection or Rejection
Resource Management
Modification of Human Behavior: Alter
aircraft flight patterns Discourage Not practical; all possible flight patterns were affected by gulls crossing the runway.
wildlife feeding Applicable.
Physical Exclusion
Netting, porcupine wire, wire grids Implemented; detention ponds, perching areas, and garbage containers were bird-proofed.
Wildlife Management
Habitat Modification:
Eliminate or modify vegetation Applicable; further studies into seasonal diet selection (invertebrates, rodents).
Eliminate standing water Ongoing; physical exclusion maintained or upgraded annually.
Roost thinning or removal Not applicable.
Frightening Devices:
Electronic distress sounds Applicable, if used in combination with depredation permit, habitat modification and physical exclusion.
Propane exploders Do.
Pyrotechnics Do.
Water spray devices Not practical; may attract gulls.
Harassment Applicable, only after gulls have associated the harassment method with danger.
Other scaring devices - Applicable, if moved often and used in combination with depredation permit and physical exclusion.
Effigies Not practical because of Foreign Object Debris (FOD) concerns.
Eye-spot balloon Not practical because of FOD concerns.
Mylar tape Not practical; not allowed by FAA and gulls do not use airfield at night.
Lights
Applicable if airport habitat is used for feeding.
Chemical Repellents:
Kill or Relocation Methods: Not practical; gulls are rarely decoyed into cage traps.
Cage traps Applicable if combined with scare tactics, habitat modification and physical exclusion.
Shooting Applicable, if occurring on site and used in combination with depredation permit and exclusion.
Egg and nest removal
Not applicable.
Chemical Toxicants:
a) Legal, Administrative
(1) Lethal Methods - Glaucous-winged gulls are protected under the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act (MBTA). USFWS permits are required to take this species and damage
their eggs and nests. In this scenario it was determined by FAA officials and the
airport manager that the gulls posed a human safety hazard.
(2) Frightening Devices - City ordinance prohibited the use of pyrotechnics within the city
limits, and special approval from city officials would have to be obtained.
b) Environmental Considerations
(1) Biological - The safety concern was not seasonal. A large urbanized population of
gulls had been steadily increasing over the last decade. The number of gulls crossing
