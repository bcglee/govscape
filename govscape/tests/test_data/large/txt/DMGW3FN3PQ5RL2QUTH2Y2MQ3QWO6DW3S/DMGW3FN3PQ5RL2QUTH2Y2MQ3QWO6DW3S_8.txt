1.7 Need for Action
The Washington Ornithological Society (1999-2001) lists over 442 bird species that inhabit Washington on
a seasonal or year-round basis. Most of these birds are migratory and pass periodically from one region or
climate to another for feeding or breeding. Migratory birds are ecologically, socially, and economically
valuable, but on occasion cause substantial damage to agriculture, property, natural resources and threats to
public health and safety. When damage occurs, WS is often requested by individuals, businesses,
municipalities, counties, and state and federal agencies to assist in reducing the damage. The USDA-APHIS-
ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised) summarized the relationship in American culture of wildlife values
and wildlife damage in this way:
"Wildlife has either positive or negative values, depending on varying human perspectives and circumstances
. . . Wildlife generally is regarded as providing economic, recreational and aesthetic benefits . . . , and the mere
knowledge that wildlife exists is a positive benefit to many people. However, . . . the activities of some wildlife
may result in economic losses to agriculture and damage to property . . . Sensitivity to varying perspectives
and values is required to manage the balance between human and wildlife needs. In addressing conflicts,
wildlife managers must consider not only the needs of those directly affected by wildlife damage but a range
of environmental, sociocultural, and economic considerations as well."
Populations of the California gull (L. californicus), glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens), herring gull
(L. argentatus), and ring-billed gull(L. delawarensis) in North America have risen dramatically in the last few
decades. In Washington and throughout the country, this has been attributed to the expansion of cities and
landfills, the creation of dredge spoil islands and reservoirs, the advent of large scale agriculture, and protection
granted under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Conover 1983; Ryder 1993). Gulls are the primary species of
wildlife damage management concern in Washington, causing 39% of the reported dollar damage attributed
to migratory species (USDA 1995-2000).
Total migratory bird damage reported and verified by WS in WA for fiscal year (FY) 1996-2000 was
$1,881,672. This damage included $1,159,596 to agriculture, $670,376 to property, $400 to natural resources,
and $51,300 to human health and safety (USDA 1995-2000). The actual amount of damage incurred is
probably much higher, because WS receives reports from only a fraction of the people experiencing wildlife
damage.
Human Health Concerns:
Disease - Migratory birds and other wildlife are host to many naturally occurring diseases called zoonotic
diseases. At least 24 of these are transmissible to humans and pets, but are not passed from human to human.
These include: the bacterial diseases avian cholera, tuberculosis, salmonellosis, botulism, campylobacter
enteritis, and ornothosis; fungal diseases aspergillosis, or brooder pneumonia, histoplasmosis, and candidiasis;
and viral diseases such as Newcastle disease and avian influenza (USGS 1999; USFWS 1987).
Between 1983-1997, Washington led the U.S. with 9 bird-related outbreaks of salmonellosis, a common, but
seldom fatal disease which can be found in many species of shorebirds, songbirds, herons, waterfowl, and
raptors (USGS 1999; USFWS 1987). Salmonellosis is spread through direct contact with infected material,
usually food and water contaminated by fecal discharge. Food poisoning characterized by acute intestinal pain
and diarrhea is the most common form of human infection.
Ornithosis varies in severity but can be fatal. In the United States, herons, waterfowl, gulls, and doves are
reported carriers (USGS 1999). The disease is spread through direct contact with infected birds and inhalation
of infected airborne fecal material. Serious outbreaks have occurred among poultry workers, and on a separate
occasion, wildlife biologists who were thought to have become infected from handling snow geese, great egrets,
