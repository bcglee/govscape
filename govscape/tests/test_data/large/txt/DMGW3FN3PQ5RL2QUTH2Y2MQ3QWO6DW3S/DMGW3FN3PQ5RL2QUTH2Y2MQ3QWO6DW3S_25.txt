WS recognizes the aesthetic importance of wildlife and associated viewing opportunities, but also acknowledges
the unsightliness and displeasure attributed to damaging birds. Under the Current Program there would
continue to be some local impacts on people’s opportunities to view some individual birds or flocks. However,
wildlife populations as a whole have not been negatively affected, and there has been no measurable decline
in public viewing opportunities. This trend would be expected to continue.
3.1.6 Summary
The Current Program is not likely, nor designed, to impact migratory bird populations on a state-wide basis.
However, some local flocks have been reduced or removed on a site-by-site basis. Most of WS’ lethal efforts
are directed toward gulls (Table 2). It is the goal of WS to manage wildlife caused damage, rather than to
control or manage wildlife populations, and there has been no discernable impact on population levels
(USFWS , pers. comm.).

The USFWS (pers. comm. ) concurs that the level of take of migratory birds for the purpose of site-specific

damage control, as described under the Current Program Alternative (Preferred Alternative), is not likely to
effect migratory bird populations at the regional or national scale.
3.2 Impact of Non-lethal Control and Technical Assistance only Alternative
3.2.1 Effectiveness of control measures in reducing or minimizing damage
The effectiveness of control measures under this alternative would most likely be decreased compared to the
Current Program, because direct control services offered by WS would no longer be available except in
instances of public health and safety. The general public is not skilled in the correct application of control
measures, nor are all control measures generally available to the public (e.g. DRC-1339, AC).
3.2.2 Impact on non-targets, including Threatened and Endangered Species
WS would have no impact on non-target species. WS would not be actively involved, and the possible impact
of others is unknown. Individuals implementing control methods may pose a greater possibility of affecting
non-target and T&E species.
The restricted-use avicide DRC-1339 and immobilizing drug AC, are not registered for use by the public or
other wildlife agencies. In some instances, it is possible that public frustration caused by an inability to reduce
losses could lead to illegal use of pesticides or chemicals, causing negative impacts on non-target, threatened,
and endangered species.
3.2.3 Impact on target species
WS would have no impact on target species. It would be expected that the impact of Alternative 2 would be
similar to the Current Program 3.1.3 on overall populations because WS’ annual take of migratory birds, with
the exception of some gull species, is very limited. However, the loss of the WS direct control program may
cause public frustration and could lead to illegal a) take of migratory birds and b) use of pesticides or
chemicals, which may negatively impact target bird populations.
3.2.4 Humaneness of control methods
The No Lethal Control Alternative is a modification of the Current Program Alternative. No direct control
would be provided by WS, except in emergency situations involving human health and safety. WS would
provide technical assistance consisting of recommendations and some training. Although many techniques may
be applicable, the individual requesting assistance would determine which recommendations to implement.
Direct control methods may be applied by people with little or no experience or knowledge in wildlife damage
management or the humane treatment of animals. Therefore, although the recommended methods may be
humane, the humaneness of their application may not be and could not be controlled. This alternative may be
less humane than the Current Program Alternative.
