Dear Mr. Woodruff:
This letter is in response to your letter, dated May 25, 2001, and received in our office on May 30, 2001, and the agency
draft Environmental Assessment of alternative strategies for the management of damage caused by migratory birds in the
State of Washington, dated June 26, 2001, and received in our office on July 19, 2001. You have requested concurrence with
your determination that management actions to control depredating birds in Washington may affect, but are not likely to
adversely affect, the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), brown pelican (Pelicanus occidentalis), marbled murrelet
(Brachyramphus marmoratus), northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and western snowy plover (Charadrius
alexandrinus nivosus), in accordance with Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1531 et seq.).
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) concurs that implementation of the proposed project is not likely to adversely
affect the bald eagle, brown pelican, marbled murrelet, northern spotted owl, and western snowy plover. This concurrence is
based on information provided in your letter and in the Environmental Assessment, and anticipated strict compliance with
FDA label requirements for the capture drug AC and the pesticide DRC-1339.
In addition, the Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center is currently conducting a multiyear study, through 2002, on
the exposure of nontarget birds to DRC-1939 in response to the FWS's concern about the potential loss of nontarget
migratory birds to this pesticide, particularly adjacent to FWS lands. Consequently, we recommend that, if DRC-1339 will
be used adjacent to any National Wildlife Refuges in Washington, refuge managers be notified prior to its use.
This concludes informal consultation pursuant to 50 CFR 402.13. The project should be reanalyzed if new information
reveals effects of the action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner, or to an extent, not considered in
this consultation. The project
