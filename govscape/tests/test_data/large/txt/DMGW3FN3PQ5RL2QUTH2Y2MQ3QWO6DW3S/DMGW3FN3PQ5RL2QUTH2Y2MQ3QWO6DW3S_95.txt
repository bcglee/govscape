Comment 18. Do you want to contribute to the declining diversity of species?
WS has no significant effect on bio-diversity (USDA 1997, revised). The Impact Analysis completed by WS
indicates that WS is not causing the decline of target species. The USFWS concurs that the level of take of
migratory birds for the purpose of site-specific damage control, as described under the Current Program
Alternative (Proposed Action), is not likely to affect migratory bird populations at the regional or national
scale (Section 3.1.3).
The species that cause the most damage also tend to be the most abundant. As glaucous-winged gull
populations grow, they not only impact the human environment, but the natural environment as well. For
example, Vermeer et. al. (1993) stated that, “Management of a potential problem species, the Glaucous-
winged Gull, may become necessary, because the species represents a potential threat to the American Black
Oystercatcher Haematopus bachmani, by usurping the latter’s nesting habitat.”
See Section 1.0 through 3.6 in the EA.
Comment 19. The EA should contain a more complete evaluation of Avitrol and DRC-1339
(disadvantageous aspects, as well as specific protocols addressing how they will be used).
Avitrol is not a chemical used by WS in the State of Washington. The commenter did not specify where they
received the information. DRC-1339 Concentrate- Gulls (EPA#56228-17) is discussed in the EA on page 11
(Section 2.1), page 13 (Section 3.1.1), and page 28 (Section 3.6.1). Section 3.6.1, Cumulative Impact
Potential from Chemical Methods, discusses the disadvantageous aspects of DRC-1339 Concentrate - Gulls,
and references Appendix 5 (Pesticide Labels) which gives specific protocols on how they will be used.
Appendix P, in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised), provides a Risk Assessment of
DRC-1339 Concentrate - Gulls.
