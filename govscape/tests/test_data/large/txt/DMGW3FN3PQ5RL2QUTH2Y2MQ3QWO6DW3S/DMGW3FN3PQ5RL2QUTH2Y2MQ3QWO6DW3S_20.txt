4,500 ring-billed gulls with DRC-1339 Concentrate - Gulls (EPA #56228-17) for the protection of
feed/livestock. This was the first and only time that DRC-1339 had been used to reduce gull damage in the
State of Washington.
Collis et al. (1999) collected direct counts of on-colony individuals on the lower Columbia River between 1996-
1998. California and ring-billed gulls were not differentiated in the census of six colonies, which found 53,252
birds. These colonies were found between The Dalles Dam and Island #18, north of Richland, Washington.
Nysewander et al. (2001) documented winter and summer densities of glaucous-winged, California, and ring-
billed gulls in Puget Sound between 1992-1999. Overall mean densities ranged from 17.5 to 34.9 birds per
km² in winter, but by summer overall densities showed an increase by 66%.
NON-GULL SPECIES
The bird species discussed below are rarely managed by WS and the number lethally removed is historically
very low (Table 2) on projects relevant to this EA. There has been no observed impact on the overall
populations of these species as a result of WS’ activities. When lethal control is required, it is usually in
response to immediate human health and safety concerns. Should there ever be a future need for WS to become
more involved in the management of damage caused by these species on projects relevant to this EA, it is
anticipated that the impact on the overall population would be equivalent to the Current Program.
Double-crested cormorant: Double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations in Washington
appear to be stable (Fig. 2c). WS hazed 1,050 and lethally removed 4 birds between FY 1996-2000 (Table
2) on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). There has been no observed impact on the overall
population of this species.
On November 8, 1999, the USFWS, in cooperation with WS, published a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS
and national management plan for the double-crested cormorant. This action was in response to increasing
populations of cormorants, and subsequent growing concern from the public and natural resource
