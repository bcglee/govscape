management agencies that cormorants are negatively impacting or pose a threat to resources such as other
colonial waterbirds, island vegetation, aquacultural stock, and sport fish populations.
Other species of cormorants found in the Pacific Northwest include the pelagic cormorant (Phalacrocorax
pelagicus) and Brandt’s cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), neither of which have been affected by WS’
activities relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). This does not, however, preclude the possible future need
for WS to become involved in the management of damage caused by pelagic and Brandt’s cormorant species.
Red-tailed hawk: The Red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) population in Washington appears to be
increasing (Fig. 2d) and is commonly abundant year-round in both eastern and western Washington (WOS
1999). Between FY 1996-2000, WS has hazed 178 birds, lethally removed 1 and freed 2 from cage traps
(Table 2) on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000).
House finches: Washington’s house finch population appears to be stable to increasing (Fig. 2d) and is
commonly abundant year-round in both eastern and western Washington (WOS 1999). The 5-year CBC shows
a sharp increase between January 1999 and 2000, whereas the 10-year BBS shows a steady upward trend of
over 7% . Between FY 1996-2000 WS has hazed 45 birds, lethally removed 1,257 and freed 2,696
from decoy traps (Table 2) on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). Two non-target house finches
were lethally removed from decoy traps between FY 1996-2000.
