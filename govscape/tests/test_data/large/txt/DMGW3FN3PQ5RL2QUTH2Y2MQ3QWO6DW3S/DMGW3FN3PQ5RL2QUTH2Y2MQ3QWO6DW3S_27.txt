* WS uses a national database, the MIS, to monitor program activities. Until 1998, the MIS did not have a species code for glaucous-winged gulls, and
there is currently no code for glaucous-winged X western gulls. These gulls have been reported as “gull other” in those respective years. Additionally,
the “gull other” code was inadvertently used as a catch-all code by several field specialists in 1997-1998. This reporting mistake was not corrected
before the year-end reports were finalized. It is estimated that about 80% of the gulls reported as “gull other” in 1997 and 1998 were ring-billed gulls
and the remainder were California and glaucous-winged. These reporting oversights have since been corrected.
