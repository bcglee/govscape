3.1.2 Impact on non-targets, including Threatened and Endangered Species.
The methods used under the Current Program are selective for target species. There has been little impact
observed on non-target species and no known impact on T&E species (see Appendix 4, Consultations with
USFWS and WDFW). All capture and removal methods allow for positive identification of target species.
The toxicant, DRC-1339, is used in accordance with EPA label requirements (Appendix 5) to minimize both
primary and secondary hazards to non-target animals. The capture drug, AC, is used in accordance with FDA
label requirements (Appendix 5) and poses little risk to non-target animals.
3.1.3 Impact on target species.
Method of analysis: The WS’ Decision Model (Appendix 3) as it relates to monitoring is discussed in detail
in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised, vol. 2, chapt. 2).
Precise counts of the bird populations addressed in this EA do not exist. When scientifically sound population
estimates are lacking, it is common practice for management agencies to use population trend analyses to
determine if species populations are “increasing”, “stable”, or “decreasing”. These trend analyses are
determined by taking actual counts at specific locations at regular intervals and comparing several years data.
WS recognizes there are shortcomings in the Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count (CBC) and North
American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). It is, however, the best information currently available, and the
Current Program is not likely, nor designed, to impact populations on a state-wide basis (USFWS , pers.

comm.).
The 5-year population trend analysis were derived from the CBC’s 1996 through 2000 using the most recent
circles (47) found in the State of Washington. The CBC index is taken from a winter count survey occurring
in December and January. Winter weather patterns often affect bird migrations, sometimes accelerating,
delaying, or disrupting movements. Winter surveys of migratory birds may be less reliable than summer
surveys, especially when only five years are examined. In addition, the local CBC for 1997 was low for most
species due to a severe storm in western Washington which caused an unusually small number of volunteers
to turn out (Easterberg, pers. comm.).
The 32-year population trend analyses were calculated by the United States Geological Survey, Patuxent
Wildlife Research Center (Sauer et al. 2000). This index is taken from the BBS, a summer count survey.
Overall, 22% of the species in the survey can be characterized as birds with specialized habitats or limited
distributions in the BBS range, with hunted species, coniferous forest nesting species, waterfowl, and wetland
nesting species guilds having >22% of their species with high variances (BBS 1966-1998). Many of the
species discussed in this EA fall into this category. Those species with ‘P’ values of greater than <0.1 do not
show trend estimates with an acceptable level of certainty or significance (USFWS , pers. comm.).

For those species where the typical level of harassment and lethal take is low (Table 2), the impacts of these
actions at the local, regional, or national population scale are insignificant (USFWS , pers. comm.).

GULLS
Gulls are the primary species of wildlife damage management concern in Washington, therefore supplemental
information pertaining to their distribution throughout North America and population status in Washington is
discussed. Gulls are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. There are no indications that WS’
activities have negatively effected populations of gull species on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-
2000). The USFWS ( pers. comm. ) concurs that the level of take of migratory birds for the purpose of site-

specific damage control, as described under the Current Program Alternative (Proposed Action), is not likely
