indicate higher LD values than birds. Toxicity to aquatic organisms is unknown (Wornecki et al. 1990) but

the compound is not generally soluble in water and therefore should remain unavailable to aquatic organisms.
Factors supporting the determination of this low potential included the lack of exposure to pets, non-target
species and the public, and the low toxicity of the active ingredient. Other supporting rationale for this
determination included relatively low total annual use and a limited number of potential exposure pathways.
The agent is currently approved for use by WS as an Investigative New Animal Drug by the FDA rather than
a pesticide.
LETHAL METHODS - MECHANICAL
Egg addling/destruction is the practice of destroying the embryo prior to hatching. Egg addling is conducted
by vigorously shaking an egg numerous times which causes detachment of the embryo from the egg sac. Egg
destruction can be accomplished in several different ways, but the most commonly used methods are manually
gathering eggs and breaking them, or by oiling or spraying the eggs with a liquid which covers the entire egg
and prevents the egg from obtaining oxygen. Although WS does not commonly use egg addling or destruction
for the species included in this EA, it is a valuable damage management tool and has shown to be effective.
Shooting is more effective as a dispersal technique than as a way to reduce bird densities when large number
of birds are present. Normally shooting is conducted with shotguns or air rifles. Shooting is a very individual
specific method and is normally used to remove a single offending bird. However, at times, a few birds could
be shot from a flock to make the remainder of the birds more wary and to help reinforce non-lethal methods.
Shooting can be relatively expensive because of the staff hours sometimes required (USDA 1997). It is selective
for target species and may be used in conjunction with the use of spotlights, decoys, and calling. Shooting with
shotguns, air rifles, or rim and center fire rifles is sometimes used to manage bird damage problems when lethal
methods are determined to be appropriate. The birds are killed as quickly and humanely as possible. All
firearm safety precautions are followed by WS when conducting damage management activities and all
applicable laws and regulations governing the lawful use of firearms are strictly complied with.
Firearm use is very sensitive and a public concern because of safety issues relating to the public and misuse.
To ensure safe use and awareness, WS employees who use firearms to conduct official duties are required to
attend an approved firearms safety and use training program within 3 months of their appointment and a
refresher course every 3 years afterwards (WS Directive 2.615). WS employees who carry firearms as a
condition of employment, are required to sign a form certifying that they meet the criteria as stated in the
Lautenberg Amendment which prohibits firearm possession by anyone who has been convicted of a
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
Sport hunting is sometimes recommended by WS as a viable damage management method when the target
species can be legally hunted. A valid hunting license and other licenses or permits may be required by the
WDFW and USFWS for certain species. This method provides sport and food for hunters and requires no cost
to the landowner. Sport hunting is occasionally recommended if it can be conducted safely for pigeon damage
management around feedlots and dairies and for crop damage by crows.
Snap traps are modified rat snap traps used to remove individual flickers. These traps pose no imminent danger
to pets or the public.
LETHAL METHODS - CHEMICAL
All chemicals used by WS are registered under FIFRA (administered by the EPA and WSDA) or by the FDA.
WS personnel that use chemical methods are certified as pesticide applicators by WSDA and are required to
