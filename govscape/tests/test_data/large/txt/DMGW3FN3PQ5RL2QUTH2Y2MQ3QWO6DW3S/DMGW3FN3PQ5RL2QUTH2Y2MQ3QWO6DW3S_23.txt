have been affected by WS’ activities relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). This does not, however, preclude
the possible future need for WS to become involved in the management of damage caused by these heron
species.
American robins: The American robin (Turdus migratorius) population in Washington appears to be
increasing (Fig. 2f), and is commonly abundant year-round in both eastern and western Washington (WOS
1999). Between FY 1996-2000, WS has hazed 617 birds, lethally removed 7 and freed 77 from cage traps
(Table 2) on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000).
WATERFOWL
(Including Dabbling & Diving Ducks, Geese, and Swans)
Migratory waterfowl, including swans, are managed and protected by the USFWS and WDFW. These species,
with the exception of swans, are legally hunted in Washington with seasons and bag limits set by both agencies.
The number of migratory waterfowl lethally removed by WS has been historically low (Table 2) and is usually
in response to immediate human health and safety concerns, particularly at airports. At current levels, these
removals have had no observed impact on the overall populations of waterfowl (WDFW , pers. comm.).

WS’ MIS system currently separates ducks into 3 categories: mallards, other dabblers, and divers. The MIS
system has not separated ducks by species in the past, however, a request for additional species codes has been
submitted to the oversight committee so as to improve monitoring of these species.
No migratory geese or swans have been lethally removed by WS for the 5-year period, FY 1996-2000 on
projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000) (see Cumulative Impacts, pg 30). The USDA-APHIS-WS
EA (1999) on resident Canada geese discusses management of this species further. Damage situations may
arise where direct control (page 10) on projects within the scope of this EA would be needed. In that event,
WS would consult with appropriate State and Federal management agencies, a permit would be required, and
a report of the take would be made to the USFWS.
Dabbling ducks: On average, WS has hazed 3,764, addled 11 eggs, and lethally removed 6 dabbling ducks
per year over the last 5 years on projects relevant to this EA (USDA 1995-2000). Two non-target dabbling
ducks were lethally removed between FY 1996-2000. Lethally removed birds may have included: gadwall
(Anas strepera), American wigeon (Anas americana), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), green-winged teal
