adhere to all certification requirements set forth in FIFRA and Washington pesticide control laws and
regulations. Chemicals are only used on private, public, or tribal property sites with authorization from the
property owner/manager.
CO2 is sometimes used to euthanize birds which are captured in live traps and when relocation is not a feasible
option. Live birds are placed in a container such as a plastic 5-gallon bucket or chamber and sealed shut. CO2
gas is released into the bucket or chamber and birds quickly die after inhaling the gas.
DRC-1339 is a slow acting avicide that is registered with the EPA for reducing damage from several species
of birds, including blackbirds, starlings, pigeons, crows, ravens, magpies, and gulls. DRC-1339 was developed
as an avicide because of its differential toxicity to mammals. DRC-1339 is highly toxic to sensitive species but
only slightly toxic to non-sensitive birds, predatory birds, and mammals. For example, starlings, a highly
sensitive species, require a dose of only 0.3 mg/bird to cause death (Royall et al. 1967). Most bird species that
are responsible for damage are highly sensitive to DRC-1339. Many other bird species such as raptors,
sparrows, and eagles are classified as non-sensitive. Numerous studies show that DRC-1339 poses minimal
risk of primary poisoning to non-target and T&E species (USDA 1997). Secondary poisoning has not been
observed with DRC-1339 treated baits. During research studies, carcasses of birds which died from DRC-1339
were fed to raptors and scavenger mammals for 30 to 200 days with no symptoms of secondary poisoning
observed (Cunningham et al. 1981). This can be attributed to relatively low toxicity to species that might
scavenge on blackbirds and starlings killed by DRC-1339 and its tendency to be almost completely metabolized
in the target birds which leaves little residue to be ingested by scavengers. Secondary hazards of DRC-1339
are almost non-existent. DRC-1339 acts in a humane manner producing a quiet and apparently painless death.
DRC-1339 is unstable in the environment and degrades rapidly when exposed to sunlight, heat, or ultra violet
radiation. DRC-1339 is highly soluble in water but does not hydrolyze and degradation occurs rapidly in water.
DRC-1339 tightly binds to soil and has low mobility. The half life is about 25 hours, which means it is nearly
100% broken down within a week, and identified metabolites (i.e., degradation chemicals) have low toxicity.
Aquatic and invertebrate toxicity is low (USDA 1997). Appendix P of USDA (1997) contains a thorough risk
assessment of DRC-1339 and the reader is referred to that source for a more complete discussion. That
assessment concluded that no adverse effects are expected from use of DRC-1339.
Other lethal methods - chemical. There are two other lethal avian pesticides registered for use in Washington;
Avitrol© and Rid-A-Bird©. WS has not used these products for more than 5 years. However, both products
are available for use by licensed pesticide applicators.
