Dear Mr. Berg
The purpose of this letter is to request an informal consultation and concurrence of findings pursuant to Section 7 of the
Endangered Species Act for listed and proposed threatened and endangered species, candidate species, and species of
concern that may be present in Washington. Based on a review of the listings provided by your office, I have analyzed the
potential impact of the program alternatives proposed in the Wildlife Services’ Environmental Assessment (EA) for the
management of damage caused by migratory birds in Washington.
Project Area
This EA evaluates alternative methods to resolve conflicts with migratory birds that include, but are not necessarily limited
to: gulls [California (Larus californicus), glaucous-winged (L. glaucescens), herring (L. argentatus), and ring-billed (L.
delawarensis)]; cormorants (Phalacrocorax species); waterfowl (Anatidae family); hawks and falcons (Accipitridae and
Falconidae families); owls [great horned (Bubo virginianus) and barn (Tyto alba)]; house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus);
northern flickers (Colaptes auratus); herons (Ardeidae family); swallows (Hirundinidae family); and American robins
(Turdus migratorius) in Washington State
Threatened and Endangered Species
The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus
marmoratus), northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and western snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus
nivosus) may occur in project areas.
Proposed Threatened and Endangered Species
None
Proposed Action and Methods
The proposed action would include WS direct control and technical assistance applied on a case-by-case basis to use the
most appropriate, effective and biologically sound methods available. This approach is known as Integrated Wildlife
Damage Management and is analyzed and discussed in Chapter 1, 1-7 of the Animal Damage Control Program, Final
Environmental Impact Statement (USDA 1997). Direct control conducted by WS may include harassment, exclusion, cage
traps, capture and relocation, capture and euthanasia, and shooting. The capture drug, alpha chloralose (AC), and the
avicide, DRC-1339, may also be used.
