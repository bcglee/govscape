Alternative Strategies for the Management of Damage Caused by Migratory Birds
in the State of Washington
wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecological critical areas. The nature of the
methods proposed for alleviating damages would not likely affect the physical
environment.
4. The effects on the quality of the human environment of the proposed activities are not
highly controversial. Although some people are opposed to some aspects of wildlife
damage management, the methods and impacts are not controversial among experts.
5. The possible effects of the proposed activities on the quality of the human
environment are not highly uncertain and do not involve unique or unknown risks.
6. The proposed activities do not establish a precedent for actions with future significant
effects or represent a decision in principle about a future consideration.
7. There are no significant cumulative effects identified by this assessment.
8. The proposed activities will not affect districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects
listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places nor will it
cause a loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical resources.
Wildlife Services activities in general, and migratory bird damage activities
specifically, do not have the potential to significantly affect historic properties. WS
has determined that the activities do not constitute a federal undertaking under Section
106 of the Natural Historic Preservation Act.
9. The proposed activities will fully comply with the Endangered Species Act of 1973,
as amended. Wildlife Services, in coordination with USFWS and WDFW determined
that the proposed activities would not affect Federally listed threatened and
endangered species.
10. There are no irreversible or irretrievable resource commitments identified by this
assessment, except for a minor consumption of fossil fuels for routine operations.
11. The proposed activities will not threaten a violation of Federal, State, or local law or
requirements imposed for the protection of the environment. The proposed activities
do not violate the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as administered by the USFWS. WS
performs all work in coordination with the USFWS to assure compliance with the
Act.
