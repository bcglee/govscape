the time of year and life cycle of the depredating bird; the vulnerability of the resource to the depredating bird
species; other land uses (such as proximity to residential areas); the feasibility of implementation of the
various allowed techniques; the status of target species; the potential presence of non-target species (such as
protected or endangered); local environmental conditions such as terrain, vegetation, and weather; the
presence of people and their pets; the presence of attractants such as trash; the potential legal restrictions
such as availability of tools or management methods; the humaneness of the available options; and the costs
of control options (the cost of control in this proposal may be a secondary concern because of overriding
environmental and legal considerations).
See Comment 12 for further discussion of effectiveness and the WS’ decision-making process.
Comment 2. No criteria are given for the term “practical” in the statement that the current program
considers recommending or using non-lethal methods when practical. There is no way to determine if
various non-lethal management methods are better choices or have even been used.
ADC Directive 2.101 states that it is program policy that “Preference is given to non-lethal methods when
practical and effective.” Practicality is dependant upon a number of variables that may not be able to be
predetermined. The definition of ‘practical’, as given by Merriam-Webster, 10th ed. (1999) is, “...Disposed
to action as opposed to speculation or abstraction... designed to supplement theoretical training by
experience.” Because wildlife and nature are dynamic, the term “practical” has application since many
environmental variables cannot be speculated upon, or predetermined. Thus, there is not one specific
formula that can be applied in every field situation to determine if non-lethal methods would be practical and
effective.
Agency personnel must implement their actions based on their experience and professional judgement,
evaluating the appropriateness of strategies and methods in the context of their availability (legal and
administrative) and suitability based on biological, economic and social considerations. All known variables
are determined prior to field application, and these are developed into a basic management plan. Since not
all variables can be predicted, some flexibility must remain for field adjustments. After the management
strategy has been implemented, monitoring is conducted and evaluation continues to assess the effectiveness
of the strategy. If the strategy is effective, the need for management is ended in that particular case, records
are kept and reported to the appropriate wildlife management agencies. This proposal would implement safe
and practical methods for the prevention and control of damage caused by migratory birds, based on local
problem analysis, environmental and social factors, and the informed judgement of trained personnel.
The Management Information System (MIS) is used to record WS’ Technical Assistance and Direct Control
activities (Section 2.1). Between FY 1996 - 2000, WS made 348 recommendations for the use of 38
different methods for the management of damage inflicted by: California gulls, glaucous-winged gulls,
herring gulls, ring-billed gulls, mallards, dabbling ducks, diving ducks, double-crested cormorants, red-tailed
hawks, house finches, great-blue herons, northern flickers, and American robins (USDA MIS 1995-2000).
A total of 274 instances of non-lethal and 74 instances of lethal methods were recommended during that
time-period, which resulted in a 1:4 ratio of lethal to non-lethal methods recommended to the public. The
methods recommended most often were: pyrotechnics (68), effigies (39), propane exploders (34), shooting
(32), harassment/shoot (27), overhead wire grids (20), various barrier exclusion devices (15), mylar tape
(13), netting (10), and mylar flags (9). Cooperator employed methods are those methods that have already
been used by the resource owner to reduce damage prior to requesting direct assistance from WS. Of the 45
instances reported, 37 involved non-lethal methods. The most popular methods used were: pyrotechnics (12),
propane exploders (7), harassment/shoot (6), various electric harassment devices (4), mylar flags (3), and
vehicle harassment (3). The ratio of lethal to non-lethal cooperator employed methods resulted in a 1:5 ratio.
