Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact
Alternative Strategies for the Management of Damage Caused by Migratory Birds
in the State of Washington
WS in Washington State has been requested by individuals, businesses, municipalities, counties, and state
and federal agencies to assist in the alleviation of problems caused by depredating birds.
These problems include:
• threats to human health and safety involving; bird strikes with aircraft, disease transmission, food
contamination, noise disturbance, and accumulation of fecal material.
• damage to Washington’s agriculture including; crop damage, disease transmission to livestock,
predation, and feed losses.
• damage to property involving; fecal contamination, structural damage, and landfill operations.
• damage to natural resources that may involve; the protection of sensitive, threatened, or endangered
species.
4. Alternatives
The following alternative courses of action were developed with input from the consulting agencies and the
public.
Alternative 1: Current Program Alternative (Proposed Action)
Alternative 1 is the “No Action” Alternative. This alternative is a continuation of the current
program, an integrated wildlife damage management approach. The “No Action” Alternative is a
procedural NEPA requirement (40 CFR 1502.14(d)).
The summary of impacts of this alternative is discussed below under Section 6. Decision and
Rationale.
Alternative 2: Non-lethal and Technical Assistance Only Alternative
Alternative 2 would discontinue any lethal direct control of migratory birds by WS, except in
emergency situations involving human health and safety. If lethal direct control were used in other
situations, it would be employed by persons or programs other than WS. Both non-lethal direct
control and technical assistance as described in 2.1 would continue to be provided by WS. Requests
for lethal direct control would likely be referred to other wildlife management agencies. The WDFW
would not accept the sole responsibility for lethal removal or capture and euthanizing of migratory
birds (WDFW , pers. comm.).

Alternative 3: Lethal Control Only Alternative
Alternative 3 would discontinue any non-lethal control of migratory birds by WS. Non-lethal
control would be employed by persons or programs other than WS. Technical assistance would be
provided, but the implementation of non-lethal methods would be the responsibility of the
cooperator.
Alternative 4: Non-lethal Methods First Alternative
Alternative 4 differs from the Current Program in that the Current Program recognizes non-lethal
methods as an important dimension of IWDM, gives them first consideration in the formulation of
each control strategy, and recommends or uses them when practical before recommending or using
lethal methods. In contrast, Alternative 4 would require that all non-lethal methods be implemented
regardless of practicality before any lethal methods are recommended or used.
Alternative 5: No Federal Program Alternative
Alternative 5 would consist of no direct control or technical assistance offered or employed by WS.
Under this alternative, wildlife damage conflicts would be handled by private resource owners and
