A second action approach is placement of physical barriers to separate the resource that has sustained or is
susceptible to damage from specific wildlife species. Fences, nets, and wire grids are examples of physical
barrier methods. Like resource management methods, these are usually applied by the resource manager or
affected party. APHIS ADC often makes technical assistance recommendations concerning the installation and
improvement of physical barrier methods to reduce wildlife damage. APHIS ADC may also loan materials or
demonstrate fencing or other physical exclusion methods.
A third approach, management of wildlife, includes habitat management, modification of wildlife behavior, and
wildlife population management to reduce damage. Habitat management includes activities such as thinning
trees from bird roosts or water level manipulation through removal of beaver dams, and is normally implemented
by the resource manager or affected party. Modification of wildlife behavior includes the use of frightening
devices, repellents, or lure crops. Population management includes translocation or lethal removal of wildlife
from local populations. Behavior and population management methods may be conducted by either the resource
manager, APHIS ADC personnel, or other wildlife damage control professionals, depending on legal and
administrative considerations in each locale.
Legal and Administrative Considerations
Wildlife damage control methods are subject to legal and administrative authorities. For example, a method
may be legal in one State and not another. Or, a method may be legal only in portions of a State (e.g., not
allowed in heavily populated areas). The status of the target species (State or federally listed as threatened or
endangered), or the presence of listed species in the general area where control activities are proposed, may
preclude the use of a method. The species may be a migratory bird, requiring a depredation permit in order to
implement specific types of control actions. Also, the APHIS ADC program itself may restrict the use of
specific methods by policy or agreement with other agencies or parties. Important questions that should be
considered for each method during this phase of the assessment include:
- Is it legal, and administratively permissible to use the method on this species within the State where the
request for assistance has been received?
- Is it legal, and administratively permissible to use the method to address this specific type of damage?
- If so, is it legal, and administratively permissible to use this method at the specific site for this request
for assistance, or are there restrictions because of land class, other land use patterns, or the presence
of listed species near the damage site?
All of the methods that pass these legal and administrative screens are available for further consideration in the
decision process. It should be noted, however, that there are additional legal considerations with regard to who
may apply (resource manager or affected party, APHIS ADC personnel, or others with expertise in wildlife
damage management) methods considered under “Formulate Wildlife Damage Control Strategy” (see p. 2-32)
Environmental Considerations
During this phase of the assessment, each legally and administratively available method is evaluated with regard
to pertinent aspects of the biological, physical, sociocultural, and economic environments. A general question
to be considered is: What are the positive or negative short- or long-term direct, indirect, or cumulative
environmental effects of implementing or not implementing control action with the method? Other important
questions that should be considered in making decisions about each method are listed below.
