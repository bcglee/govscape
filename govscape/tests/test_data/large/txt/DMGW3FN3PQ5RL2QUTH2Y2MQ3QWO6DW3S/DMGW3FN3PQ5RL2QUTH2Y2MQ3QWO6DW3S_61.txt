Often the most appropriate response is a combination of non-lethal and lethal methods, and there will be
instances where application of lethal methods alone is the most appropriate strategy.
Strategy Considerations
Available Expertise
As previously discussed, some control methods are usually applied by the resource manager or affected party.
Other methods can be used by resource managers or other professional wildlife damage control personnel, and
still others may only be applied by APHIS ADC personnel.
The availability of expertise to address each specific request for assistance may influence the balance of
technical assistance and direct control activities when formulating the IPM strategy. Relatively simple damage
problems may be adequately addressed through technical assistance. However, effective solutions to many
damage problems require an integration of those methods used by the resource manager with direct control
services provided by the APHIS ADC program or other professional wildlife damage managers. The
availability of APHIS ADC expertise for direct control to address complex damage problems is dependent on
cooperative or congressionally directed funding. Cooperators are generally more inclined to provide funding
for problems requiring special expertise than for those problems they can either solve on their own or through
technical assistance. In addition, Federal and State legislators are more likely to appropriate public funds to
solve problems requiring special equipment, materials, and expertise.
Legal Constraints on Method Users
Screening was previously performed (see “Legal and Administrative Considerations” on p. 2-30) to determine
which methods were legally and administratively permissible for this problem. It is necessary here to consider
any additional legal constraints on methods that define who may apply each method. The avicide DRC 1339,
for example, can be used only by USDA personnel trained in bird damage control or persons under their direct
supervision. Use of the livestock protection (LP) collar is restricted to specially trained and certified LP collar
applicators who may be APHIS ADC employees (see Appendix Q).
Cost
Cost effectiveness is an obvious goal in wildlife damage management. However, the costs of implementing
wildlife damage management cannot be considered independently from the damage problem, probable environ-
mental impacts, and other strategy considerations.
The costs of methods and their application should be weighed against the severity of damage. Even in cases
involving serious damage, lack of funds may constrain the resource manager or affected party from hiring
special expertise adequate to solve the problem.
In relatively simple wildlife damage problems, such as excluding squirrels or raccoons from urban structures,
the provision of technical assistance is usually sufficient and the least costly means of providing a solution.
Difficult wildlife damage problems are usually not as easily or effectively resolved through technical assistance
alone. For example, a livestock producer who is using all practical, state-of-the-art resource management and
physical barrier methods may also require direct control assistance to successfully constrain continuing losses.
In this scenario, the monetary costs for implementing an IPM strategy include both the costs of direct control
applied by APHIS ADC and the costs incurred by the resource manager for implementing resource management
and physical barrier methods.
