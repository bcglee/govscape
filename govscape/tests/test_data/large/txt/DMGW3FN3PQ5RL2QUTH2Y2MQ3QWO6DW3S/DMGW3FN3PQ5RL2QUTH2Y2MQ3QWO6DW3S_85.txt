Comment 3. The Decision Model used in the EA is not quantitative.
Decision-making steps that WS personnel take are fundamentally the same as those for other professionals,
and the model necessarily oversimplifies complex thought processes (USDA 1997, revised). Quantitative
analysis is used when quantifiable data are available, but many issues are qualitative by nature, and
therefore, the Decision Model is not quantitative. Both quantitative and qualitative data are considered in the
NEPA process and in the Decision Model (Appendix 3; USDA 1997, revised). See response to comment
number 12 for more discussion of the Decision Model.
Comment 4. The EA does not include comparison of the efficacy or cost/benefits for any methods for
each target species. An EIS is required to show the cost/benefits of the program.
An EIS is not required unless there may be a significant impact on the environment. This EA has resulted in
a Finding of No significant Impact, through a NEPA process that went beyond minimum requirements to
comply with CEQ and APHIS agency implementing regulations. CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.23) do not
require a formal, monetized cost-benefit analysis, especially when qualitative issues are involved (such as
human lives and safety). Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis is used to help compare alternatives, and is not
necessary nor applicable in this analysis. The approach taken in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS
(1997, revised), to which the EA is tiered, (see the Economic Impact Assessment in Chapter 4 of the EIS)
weighs the economic merits and drawbacks of five program alternatives.
The major conclusions of that analysis are worth summarizing here. With regard to the Current Program
Alternative in the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised) (similar to the current program in
this EA), there is evidence that the use of control methods can be effective, even though the precise monetary
value of avoided losses cannot be rigorously established. Based on the analysis’ made in the USDA-APHIS-
ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised), the No Lethal Control by WS Alternative in the EA would reduce
some program costs as clients went out of business since many types of damage could not be addressed,
however the residual efforts by WS employees would cost more to implement. Costs to clients would
increase as they would have to take over their own control activities. The costs and benefits of this
alternative would eventually be the same as the No Management of Migratory Bird Damage by WS
Alternative as the program is eliminated. The Exhaust all Non-lethal Methods Before Lethal Methods are
Considered Alternative would be more costly to both the program and to clients and this could lead to less
productivity and efficiency on the part of the program and loss of businesses to WS’ cooperators. Based on
this analysis of the alternatives analyzed in this EA, which is tiered to the USDA-APHIS-ADC
Programmatic EIS (1997, revised), the Current Program Alternative (Proposed Action) appears to offer a
favorable ratio of benefits to costs, even though these costs and benefits cannot be rigorously quantified.
As stated in Section 1.2 of the EA and Chapter 1 of the USDA-APHIS-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997,
revised), the primary justification of the WS program is to resolve conflicts between humans and wildlife.
This justification is both different and broader than ‘reducing economic losses’. The WS program addresses
a broad range of conflicts between humans and wildlife. Such conflicts will increase in the future, and the
need for professional management of such conflicts will also increase.
Comment 5. There is no reason to believe that non-lethal methods would be used preferentially in
every case.
In the discussion of Alternative 4 (Section 2.4 and 3.4) the EA states that non-lethal methods are an
important dimension of IWDM, gives them first consideration in the formulation of each control strategy,
and recommends or uses them when practical, before recommending or using lethal methods. In addition,
ADC Directive 2.101 requires the use of non-lethal methods when practical and effective. WS field
personnel use the IWDM approach and the WS Decision Model to develop a control strategy on a case-by-
case basis. WS concurs that non-lethal methods may not be used preferentially in every case because every
