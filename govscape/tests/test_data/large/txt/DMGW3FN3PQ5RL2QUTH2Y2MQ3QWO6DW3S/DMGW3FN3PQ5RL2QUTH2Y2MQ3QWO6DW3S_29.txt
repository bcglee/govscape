3.5.4 Humaneness of control methods
The No Federal Program Alternative would result in no impact by WS. The impact of others would be
unknown. Impacts may be similar to Alternative 2 (3.2.4). However, there would be no technical assistance
from WS on humane methods of wildlife damage management.
3.5.5 Aesthetic value of depredating birds, public viewing opportunities.
Analysis of aesthetics would be similar to those discussed under Alternative 2 (3.2.5) since WS would not
impact populations, but individuals may.
3.6 Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts, as defined by CEQ (40 CFR 1508.7), are impacts on the environment that result from
the incremental impact of an action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions, regardless of what agency (Federal or Non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.
Cumulative impacts may result from individually minor, but collectively significant, actions taking place over
time.
Under the current program, WS addresses damage associated with birds in a number of situations throughout
Washington and is expected to continue at the present level or to increase slightly in the near future. The WS
program is the primary Federal program with wildlife damage management responsibilities.
Listed below is the average take per year (FY1996-2000) and range (low-high) of all WSâ€™ permitted migratory
bird control operations in Washington that are relevant to this EA. Between February 28, 1995 and October
31, 2000, forty-five depredation permits were issued by the USFWS. The USFWS reported this take as
extremely low (USFWS , pers. comm.). Permittees are required to submit an annual report of activities to the
1
USFWS one calendar year from the issue date of the permit. Under the Current Program, no notable
cumulative impact on migratory species has been observed or intended.
