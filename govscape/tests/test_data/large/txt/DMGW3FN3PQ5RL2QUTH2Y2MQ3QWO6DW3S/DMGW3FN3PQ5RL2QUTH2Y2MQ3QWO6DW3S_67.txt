should also be reanalyzed if the action is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to a listed
species or critical habitat that was not considered in this consultation, and/or a new species is listed or critical
habitat is designated that may be affected by this project.
Although the Western Washington Office has addressed the consultation requirements for the entire state in this
letter, future consultations should be addressed to both the Western Washington Office and the Upper Columbia
Fish and Wildlife Office in Spokane. The address is Susan Martin, Manager, 11103 E. Montgomery Drive,
Spokane, WA 99206. Early initiation of the consultation process will facilitate our review and will be essential to
plan for adequate review by both offices.
If you have further questions about this letter or your responsibilities under the Act, please contact Dr. L. Karolee
Owens at (360) 753-4369.
