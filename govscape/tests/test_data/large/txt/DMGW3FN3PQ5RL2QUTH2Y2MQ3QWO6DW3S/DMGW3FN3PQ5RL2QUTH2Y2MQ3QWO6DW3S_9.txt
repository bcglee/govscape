snowy egrets, white-winged doves, and ducks (USFWS 1987). In Washington, two WS technicians working
with birds were sickened and diagnosed with ornithosis, and in a subsequent year, 20% of the Washington WS
technicians tested showed exposure to ornithosis.
The USDA-National Food and Agriculture Council (NFAC) has taken precautions to prevent the spread of
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) in the United States. FMD is difficult to control and has occurred in 60%
of the world (USDA-NFAC, 2001). Humans may spread the disease by tracking contaminated feces from
place-to-place on their footwear, however, observations of bird-use at feedlots in Washington suggests that the
migration of birds from feedlot to feedlot may contribute to the spread of disease (USDA 2001).
Accumulation of droppings - Gulls commonly nest on rooftops, equipment, piers and rocky outcroppings
(Belant 1997, et al. 1993; Butterfield et al. 1983; Monaghan & Coulson 1977; Conover 1983; Winkler 1996;
Pierotti & Good 1994; Ryder 1993; ). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers
bird droppings in the work place hazardous [OSHA sanitation standard 29CFR 1910.141(a)(5)]. In 2000,
the Department of Labor and Industries fined the Washington Department of Transportation Ferry System
$2,500 for health hazards created by pigeon and gull droppings on a new passenger skyway (Seattle Post-
Intelligencer 2000). In addition to health concerns, feces may also pose slipping hazards on bridges, catwalks,
hand rails, docks, and other structures. Between FY 1996-2000, WS recorded droppings from gulls,
cormorants, ducks and swallows causing more than $228,590 in damage to equipment, structures, landscaping,
and human health and safety concerns (USDA 1995-2000).
Human Safety Concerns:
WS receives several requests annually for assistance regarding wildlife hazard management at airports in
Washington. These requests are considered serious because of the potential for loss of human life and because
damage to aircraft can be extremely expensive.
Nationally, bird strikes cause an estimated 7 fatalities and $245 million damage to civilian and military aircraft
each year (Conover et al. 1995). In 1995, a military jet taking off at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska
crashed after striking a flock of Canada geese. All 24 crew members were killed and the $190 million aircraft
was destroyed (Dolbeer 1997). The collision of aircraft with birds is a serious concern at airports throughout
Washington and may involve any species of migratory bird, including gulls, barn owls, bald eagles, red-tailed
hawks, American kestrels, Canada geese, ducks, swallows, robins and great-blue herons, to name a few (USDA
Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard 1995-2000). There were 382 bird strikes to civil aircraft reported to the FAA for
the State of Washington from 1990-1998 (Cleary et al. 1999). The number of bird strikes to military aircraft
in Washington is unavailable, and it is estimated that only 20-25% of all bird strikes are reported (Conover et
al. 1995, Dolbeer et al. 1995, Linnell et al. 1996, Linnell et al. 1999). Hence, the number of bird strikes in
Washington are most likely much greater than FAA records show.
Damage to Agriculture:
Crop damage - Bird damage to agricultural crops costs U.S. farmers more than $100 million annually (Besser
1985) and can pose a large economic threat to agricultural producers. On many farms or orchards, bird
damage is minimal and growers choose to ignore the problem or take the loss from birds into account as a
management cost. For others, problems from birds can be substantial, resulting in the consumption of, or
damage to large portions of the fruit crop. Damage reported to WS is often from those farmers who suffer the
greatest amount of damage.
Fruit and berry production contributed over $1.9 billion to Washingtonâ€™s economy in 1999. Losses reported
by farmers and verified by WS in FY 1999 totaled $66,500. Based on data collected by the NASS and WS
in 1998, this figure probably represents only a fraction of the actual damage incurred throughout Washington.
