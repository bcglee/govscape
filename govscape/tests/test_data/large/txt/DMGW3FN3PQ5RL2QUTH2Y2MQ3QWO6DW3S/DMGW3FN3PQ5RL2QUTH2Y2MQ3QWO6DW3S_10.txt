For example, the Washington Blueberry Commission estimated a 10% loss in 2000, resulting in a loss of
$840,000 from bird damage (Anderson, pers. comm.). Between FY 1996-2000, WS recorded a total of
$431,550 in damage to cherry, apple, grape, blueberry, and black raspberry crops. American robins inflicted
80% of that loss, followed by gulls and house finches. California and ring-billed gull have been documented
to occasionally eat dates, cherries, blueberries, and strawberries (Behle 1958; Kibbe 1979; Speich & Wahl
1989; Ryder 1993; Winkler 1996). California and Ring-billed gulls will land in cherry trees, eating the fruit
straight off the tree (Cottam 1935; Ryder 1993; USDA 1995-2000). Gulls in cherry orchards do not disperse
evenly, with one gull attracting the entire flock into a single tree, until all edible fruit is eaten and the flock
moves to the next (Smith, pers. comm.). Migratory birds, such as ducks, geese and swans may also inflict
substantial damage to alfalfa, grain, bean, lentil, and other field crops (USDA 1995-2000).
Washington aquaculture consists of penned salmon, trout, sturgeon, char, catfish, bass, carp, seaweed, and
mollusks (clams, clam seed, mussels, oysters, and oyster seed). Washington leads the nation in the sale of
mollusks, with a value of $28.4 million in 1998 (NASS 2000). In 1998, Washington had 91 farms involved
a
in aquaculture; 28 of these utilized fresh water while 66 were salt water operations. The economic effect of
migratory birds on aquaculture farms can be extensive and can result in significant expenditure of time and
funds in establishing bird management programs. In recent years, populations of normally migratory birds
have been reported to remain near aquaculture facilities year-round. Besides consuming fish, birds can injure
fish, disrupt their feeding activity, disturb broodstock, and contribute to the spread of diseases and parasites.
In marine environments, large numbers of birds often roost on shellfish culture or holding structures (Gorenzel
et al. 1994). Migratory birds commonly responsible for damage in Washington include herons, cormorants,
gulls, mergansers and other diving ducks, kingfishers, and grebes (USDA 1995-2000). Aquaculture farmers
reported $545,000 in damage to WS between FY 1996-2000, of which $541,000 consisted of damage to
shellfish culture from scoters (Melanitta species). WS will conform with the USFWS Directorâ€™s Order No.
27 when addressing damage situations at aquaculture facilities.
Livestock and poultry - Large flocks of gulls often congregate at feedlots and have been implicated in the
transmission of at least 16 livestock and poultry diseases such as salmonella, botulism, coccidiosis, and beef
tapeworm (Williams et al. 1977; Crewe 1967; USGS 1999). In Washington, hawks and owls have been
documented to take chickens and other fowl, and have occasionally killed commercially raised game-birds
(USDA 1995-2000).
Feed losses - Gulls cause damage at cattle feeding facilities when congregating, sometimes by the hundreds,
to feed on silage, the most nutritious part of cattle feed. Gulls compete with cattle by selecting the high energy
portion of the silage from cattle rations, raising the likelihood of infecting livestock which feed on dropping
contaminated rations. (USDA 1995-2000). This removal is believed to reduce weight gains, milk yields, and
is economically undesirable (Feare 1984). Damage to cattle, feed, and silage reported to WS between FY
1996-2000 amounted to $96,930. The identification of feedlots as feeding sites has been well documented
(Butterfield et al. 1983; Conover 1983; Solman et al. 1983; Ryder 1993; Winkler 1996), but little data has been
collected on the impact of gulls on feedlots.
Damage to Property:
Migratory bird-caused damage to property in Washington State, reported to WS, was $670,476 for FY 1996-
2000. Migratory birds can damage vehicles, homes, buildings, water craft, equipment, bridges, industrial
facilities, and other property due to fecal contamination and nest building. Vermeer (1998) noted that a
$350,000 roof was estimated to last only half as long as originally credited because of both chemical erosion
caused by defecation and of water damage caused by the blockage of drainage pipes by feathers and nest
material of gulls. Corrosion damage to metal structures and painted finishes, including those on automobiles,
