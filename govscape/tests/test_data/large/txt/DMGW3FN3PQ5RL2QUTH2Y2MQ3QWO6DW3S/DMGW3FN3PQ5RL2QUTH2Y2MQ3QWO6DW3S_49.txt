Cannon nets are normally used for larger birds such as feral waterfowl and use mortar projectiles to
propel a net up and over birds which have been baited to a particular site. This type of net is especially
effective for feral waterfowl that are flightless due to molting and other birds which are typically shy
to other types of capture.
Environmental/Habitat/Behavior modification is an integral part of wildlife damage management. The type,
quality, and quantity of habitat are directly related to the wildlife that are produced. Therefore, habitat can be
managed to not produce or attract certain bird species or to repel certain birds. Most habitat management
revolves around airports and bird aircraft strike problems and blackbird and starling winter roosts. Habitat
management around airports is aimed at eliminating bird nesting, roosting, loafing, or feeding sites. Generally,
many bird problems on airport properties can be minimized through management of vegetation and water from
runway areas. Habitat management is often necessary to minimize damage caused by blackbirds and starlings
that form large roosts during late autumn and winter. Bird activity can be greatly reduced at roost sites by
removing all the trees or selectively thinning the stand. Roosts often will re-form at traditional sites, and
substantial habitat alteration is the only way to permanently stop such activity (USDA 1997).
Lure crops/alternate foods. When depredations cannot be avoided by careful crop selection or modified
planting schedules, lure crops can sometimes be used to mitigate the loss potential. Lure crops are planted or
left for consumption by wildlife as an alternative food source. This approach provides relief for critical crops
by sacrificing less important or specifically planted fields. Establishing lure crops is sometimes expensive,
requires considerable time and planning to implement, and may attract other unwanted species to the area.
NON-LETHAL METHODS - CHEMICAL
Methyl anthranilate (MA) could be used or recommended by WS as a bird repellent. MA is currently
registered as a repellent to protect turf from bird grazing and as a spray for airport runways to reduce bird
activity/risk on or near airports. It is also being investigated as a livestock feed additive to reduce or prevent
feed consumption by birds. Such chemicals undergo rigorous testing and research to prove safety, effectiveness,
and low environmental risks before they would be registered by EPA or the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA).
Anthraquinone (AQ) is registered as a repellent to protect turf from goose damage. Research continues and
other applications (i.e. seed or fruit protection) may become available in the future. Like methyl anthranilate,
AQ has low toxicity to birds and mammals. Avian species consuming AQ for the first time typically exhibit
no immediate aversion but are subsequently repelled due to a suspected post-ingestional response (Blackwell,
et al 1999).
Alpha-chloralose is a central nervous system depressant used as an immobilizing agent to capture and remove
nuisance waterfowl and other birds. It is labor intensive and in some cases, may not be cost effective (Wright
1973, Feare et al. 1981), but is typically used in recreational and residential areas, such as swimming pools,
shoreline residential areas, golf courses, or resorts. Alpha-chloralose is typically delivered as a well contained
bait in small quantities with minimal hazards to pets and humans; single bread or corn baits are fed directly to
the target birds. WS personnel are present at the site of application during baiting to retrieve the immobilized
birds. Unconsumed baits are removed from the site following each treatment. Alpha-chloralose was eliminated
from more detailed analysis in USDA (1997) based on critical element screening, therefore, environmental fate
properties of this compound were not rigorously assessed. However, the solubility and mobility are believed
to be moderate and environmental persistence is believed to be low. Bioaccumulation in plants and animal tissue
is believed to be low. Alpha-chloralose is used in other countries as an avian and mammalian toxicant. The
compound is slowly metabolized, with recovery occurring a few hours after administration (Schafer 1991). The
dose used for immobilization is designed to be about two to 30 times lower than the LD . Mammalian data
