into the trough by the feed truck. They are not practical for deterring gulls from open-air feedlot
operations that are not housed in buildings.
Relocation of birds to other areas following live capture generally would not be effective nor cost-
effective. Since gulls, waterfowl, and most other damaging bird species are common and numerous
throughout Washington, they are rarely if ever relocated because habitats in other areas are generally
already occupied. Relocation of wildlife often involves stress to the relocated animal, poor survival
rates, the threat of spreading disease and difficulties in adapting to new locations or habitats.
Nest destruction is the removal of nesting materials during the construction phase of the nesting cycle.
Nest destruction would only be applied when dealing with a single or very few birds. This method is
used to discourage birds from constructing nests in areas which may create nuisances for home and
business owners. Heusmann and Bellville (1978) reported that nest removal was an effective but time-
consuming method because problem bird species are highly mobile and can easily return to damage
sites from long distances, or because of high populations. This method poses no imminent danger to
pets or the public.
Live traps include:
Clover, funnel, and common pigeon traps are enclosure traps made of nylon netting or hardware cloth
and come in many different sizes and designs, depending on the species of birds being captured. The
entrance of the traps also vary greatly from swinging-door, one-way door, funnel entrance, to tip-top
sliding doors. Traps are baited with grains or other food material which attract the target birds. WS’
standard procedure when conducting pigeon trapping operations is to ensure that an adequate supply
of food and water is in the trap to sustain captured birds for several days. Active traps are checked
daily, every other day, or as appropriate, to replenish bait and water and to remove captured birds.
Decoy traps are used by WS for preventive and corrective damage management. Decoy traps
are similar in design to the Australian Crow Trap as reported by Johnson and Glahn (1994)
and McCracken (1972). Live decoy birds of the same species that are being targeted are
usually placed in the trap with sufficient food and water to assure their survival. Perches are
configured in the trap to allow birds to roost above the ground and in a more natural position.
Feeding behavior and calls of the decoy birds attract other birds which enter and become
trapped themselves. Active decoy traps are monitored daily, every other day, or as
appropriate, to remove and euthanize excess birds and to replenish bait and water. Decoy traps
and other cage/live traps, as applied and used by WS, pose no danger to pets or the public and
if a pet is accidentally captured in such traps, it can be released unharmed.
Nest box traps are used by WS for corrective damage management and are effective in capturing local
breeding and post breeding starlings and other targeted secondary cavity nesting birds (DeHaven and
Guarino 1969, Knittle and Guarino 1976).
Mist nets are more commonly used for capturing small-sized birds such as house sparrows, finches,
etc. but can be used to capture larger birds such as feral waterfowl and ring-neck pheasants. It was
introduced in to the United States in the 1950's from Asia and the Mediterranean where it was used to
capture birds for the market (Day et al. 1980). The mist net is a fine black silk or nylon net usually 3
to 10 feet wide and 25 to 35 feet long. Net mesh size determines which birds can be caught and
overlapping “pockets” in the net cause birds to entangle themselves when they fly into the net.
