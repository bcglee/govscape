Appendix A
Response to Comments
to the
Environmental Assessment for the Alternative Strategies for the Management of Damage Caused by
Migratory Birds in the State of Washington
Wildlife Services (WS) received 2 comment letters in response to the Invitation for Public Involvement letter
and 58 comment letters on the Pre-Decisional EA. All of the commenters expressed an opinion on the
Proposed Action or on the topic of lethal control. Many of these comments were opposed to any alternative
which incorporated the lethal control of migratory birds as an option.
Proper consideration must be given to all reasonable points of view, particularly as they may relate to the
issues being considered. In this light, it is important to consider and address concerns or criticisms that may
arise. Appendix A is a summary of comments received on the Pre-Decisional EA, with the corresponding
WS responses.
Comment 1. The EA does not support the conclusion that Alternative 4 would be expected to be less
effective than the Current Program. Program effectiveness is not quantified.
Alternative 4 would require that all non-lethal methods be implemented regardless of practicality before
any lethal methods are recommended or used (Section 2.4). Constraints on flexibility and effectiveness
imposed by the application of Alternative 4 reduces the ability of a program to address the full range of
wildlife damage problems. Flexibility allows increased effectiveness. Although Section 3.1.1 states that the
effectiveness of the program can be gauged in terms of reduced economic losses, both present and future,
decreased health and safety hazards, and minimized property damage, the results may not be quantifiable.
These factors are considered on a case-by-case basis through the use of the WS Decision Model. A detailed
explanation of the step-by-step approach used by the WS Decision Model, as described in the APHIS-
USDA-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised), has been inserted into Appendix 3.
The intent of using the issue of program effectiveness is to have a relative comparison for evaluating the
appropriateness of the alternatives against general program objectives. Effectiveness of a method, or
combination of methods, is subject to environmental, legal, and administrative constraints and considerations,
thus they are not quantitative. For example, the National Wildlife Research Center conducts research
regarding the behavior of birds, the effectiveness of wildlife damage control methods, and many other topics
related to the control of wildlife damage. This research is one basis for WS approaches to the control of
wildlife damage.
Effectiveness can be defined by how well wildlife specialists identify the species causing a problem and then
alleviate or reduce the damage to an acceptable level. The specialist must be able to complete wildlife
damage management expeditiously, within limitations to minimize harm to non-target animals and the
environment, and in the lawful use of each method, while at the same time using methods as humanely as
possible within the limitations of current technology. Many of the details on effectiveness were discussed in
the APHIS-USDA-ADC Programmatic EIS (1997, revised) where integrated wildlife damage management
was concluded to be the most effective. The effectiveness of the proposed action alternative is rated as the
highest of the alternatives, because it allows for the most options and flexibility to select a strategy that is the
most effective after consideration and application of all variables and constraints.
An effective program requires that site specific consideration of the many variables listed below be given to
allow the wildlife specialist to select and implement the most appropriate technique to resolve each unique
damage situation. Flexibility in the management approach is important because of the high variability found
in the natural environment. In selecting management techniques for specific damage situations, consideration
must be given to such variables as: the magnitude of the threat of damage; the geographic extent of threat;
