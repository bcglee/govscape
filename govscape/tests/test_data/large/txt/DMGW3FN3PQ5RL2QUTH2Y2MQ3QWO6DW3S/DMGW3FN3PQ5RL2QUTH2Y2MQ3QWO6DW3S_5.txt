This EA evaluates ways by which this responsibility can be carried out to resolve conflicts with migratory birds
that include, but are not necessarily limited to: cormorants (Phalacrocorax species); herons (Ardeidae family);
waterfowl (Anatidae family); hawks and falcons (Accipitridae and Falconidae families); gulls [California
(Larus californicus), glaucous-winged (L. glaucescens), herring (L. argentatus), and ring-billed (L.
delawarensis)]; owls [great horned (Bubo virginianus) and barn (Tyto alba)]; northern flickers (Colaptes
auratus); swallows (Hirundinidae family); American robins (Turdus migratorius); and house finches
(Carpodacus mexicanus). These migratory species and species groups have consistently posed the most
damage and required the greatest attention by WS in Washington over the past 5 years (FY 1996-2000).
1.3 Public Involvement
Solicitation for Input, Information, and Issues:
WS used the information gathered from agency personnel, the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS),
Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS),
Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the public
in preparing this document. Public input was obtained through written comments provided in response to a
public involvement letter. Three hundred and five public involvement letters were sent to state, federal, county,
and municipal agencies, businesses, animal welfare and animal rights organizations, and individuals. The
public involvement letter invited information concerning the issues and alternatives involving bird damage
caused by the species addressed in this EA. Two letters were received in response to the invitations. The issues
and alternatives identified in this process have been considered in this document and all individuals expressing
interest in this process received a copy of the pre-decisional EA.
Agency Review:
Following the public involvement process, the preliminary EA was presented to the consulting agencies
(USFWS, WDFW, WSDA, and FAA) for interagency review.
Public notice of Availability:
Legal notices of availability will be placed in; The Seattle Times, The Wenatchee World, The Tri-City Herald,
The Columbian and The Spokesman Review to solicit input on the pre-decisional EA.
1.4 Purpose and Scope
The purpose of the proposed management activities is to reduce or alleviate damage to agriculture, property,
natural resources, and human health and safety caused by migratory birds.
This EA examines potential environmental impacts of the proposed WS program and alternatives, as it
responds to requests from individuals, businesses, associations, and government agencies to alleviate or reduce
actual and potential damage in the state of Washington. The State of Washington was selected as the area of
site specific analysis for this document. This determination was based upon the authorities of the various
management agencies (Appendix 1), the species involved and their legal status (page 2), and the routine use
of the site-specific WS decision model (Appendix 3).
This EA will remain valid until WS and other appropriate agencies determine that new needs for action,
changed conditions, or new alternatives having different environmental effects must be analyzed. At that time,
this analysis and document may be revised or amended pursuant to NEPA. WS supervisors (wildlife
biologists) monitor the Management Information System (MIS) reports bi-weekly and are constantly aware of
ongoing field operations. Review of this EA will be conducted annually to ensure that the analysis is still
sufficient.
