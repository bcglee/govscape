the airfield was likely continue to grow in number and frequency unless dispersed. No
Threatened or Endangered (T&E) species were observed in the area, and no known
T&E species nests had been recorded by State or Federal wildlife management
agencies. If such species had been found at or near the airport, consultation with
USFWS would begin.
(2) Sociocultural - The bird-strike had received little media attention and most of the
public was unaware of the threats that birds and other wildlife posed to human health
and safety. The airport Public Relations Officer had given an interview with local
networks to educate those interested in wildlife issues at airports. Further cooperation
and education between the airport and the surrounding communities was proposed.
(3) Economic - The most serious economic consideration was damages that would be
incurred should there be an air strike with a bird(s), which could cause loss of life or
injuries to aircraft passengers. Lawsuits resulting from such an accident could cost
the airport and the air carrier millions of dollars. Direct costs of damage to airplanes
resulting from air strikes must also be considered. Several economic side effects
could also result if the problem persisted and carriers were forced to reroute their
flights to other airports.
(4) Physical - A perimeter road within the AOA made it possible to set-up and move
equipment frequently and efficiently. This also allowed airport personnel to use scare
tactics while patrolling or fulfilling other duties. A Wildlife Hazard Management
Plan (WHMP) would set a time-line for sampling and monitoring wildlife habitat and
movement areas.
In order to obtain long-term success in changing the behavior of gulls crossing the runways, it would be
necessary to implement an integrated approach that incorporated the safe use of lethal and non-lethal control.
c) Applicable Methods
Based on the evaluation, the following methods were considered as practical control methods: habitat
modification; frightening devices, including electronic distress sounds, propane exploders,
pyrotechnics, and effigies; chemical repellents; and lethal removal, including shooting, and egg and
nest removal.
Step 4. Formulate Control Strategy
The WS Specialist and the airport manager met to develop a control strategy for the damage problem. The
control strategy was formulated as a result of the Step 3 evaluation and it was determined that the problem
needed to be resolved as soon as possible to prevent further chances of air strikes, resulting in possible
fatalities. Furthermore, the WHMP would identify wildlife attractants and additional species of birds and
mammals that may be of concern to airport operations based on that speciesâ€™ abundance, size, and overall
use of the AOA.
It was decided that the best control strategy would be to immediately remove glaucous-winged gulls that
entered the AOA. Frightening devices would not be implemented at first for two reasons: (1) the first gulls
hazed may not realize they are being hazed because they are not conditioned, and (2) the gulls that are not
immediately removed associate the loud noise with physical harm and leave the area. The combined use of
frightening devices and shooting would be determined based upon gull behavior. The continued integration
of physical exclusion (netting, wire grids, porcupine wire) and habitat modification for preventing the use of
the airport environment by gulls and other wildlife would be followed according to the findings of the
WHMP, mandated by the FAA. The airport manager and WS would acquire the necessary depredation
permits from the USFWS to implement the desired control strategy.
