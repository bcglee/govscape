Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact
Alternative Strategies for the Management of Damage Caused by Migratory Birds
in the State of Washington
Program impacts on aesthetics of migratory birds and the damage they cause: There will continue to
be ample migratory bird viewing opportunities. Aesthetic values are subjective, but presumably,
fewer damage problems with birds will increase their aesthetic appeal for many people.
Program Effectiveness: The Current Program is considered to be the most effective of the
alternatives in reducing damages. The Current Program will allow WS to most effectively assist the
public in resolving damage problems with migratory birds in Washington State.
Cumulative Impacts: The Current Program will not contribute to significant cumulative impacts on
migratory bird populations in Washington State. WS activities will be monitored, and WS will
coordinate their activities with WDFW and USFWS. USFWS and WDFW concur that the
Proposed Action will not significantly impact migratory bird populations.
7. Compliance and Monitoring
WS will continue to formulate a joint strategy for program monitoring, data collection and analysis with
WDFW and the USFWS. WS’ activity will be monitored via periodic coordination contacts with those
cooperating agencies. WS will work within management objectives set by USFWS and WDFW. WS will
continue to record all activities in its Management Information System database. WS plans to review this
EA annually to ensure that the EA is consistent with all state and Federal agency management plans,
guidelines, and environmental regulations or policies, and that program impacts are properly reflected in the
analysis. Should any changes occur that could substantially alter the analysis and Decision, WS would
revise the EA and Decision appropriately. Substantial changes in the scope of this project, new substantive
issues or reasonable alternatives, or changes in the guidance documents or environmental regulations could
trigger the need for additional analysis.
8. Site Specificity
Washington State was the area of analysis for this EA for the following reasons; the smallest area of
authority of the consulting agencies (WDFW and USFWS) is statewide and the species involved are
managed by State and Federal agencies. WS personnel use the WS Decision Model as a site specific tool at
each location, and a smaller area of analysis would not change the overall analysis, add to the public’s
understanding of the proposal, or provide additional useful or relevant information to the decision-maker.
FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT
A careful review of the Washington Wildlife Services EA indicates that there will not be a significant impact
on the quality of the human environment as a result of this proposal. I agree with this conclusion, and
therefore, determine that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will not be prepared. This determination
is based on consideration of the following factors:
1. Migratory bird damage management, as conducted by WS in the State of Washington,
will occur in isolated or localized areas and only where a request for assistance is
directed to Wildlife Services. The proposed activities are not national or regional in
scope.
2. The methods used to control bird damage are highly target specific and are not likely
to significantly affect public health and safety. The proposed program may benefit
public health and safety by reducing the potential risks of bird/aircraft strikes,
disease transmission to humans and livestock, injuries in the workplace caused by
slipping on feces, and the transmission of pathogens to food processing facilities.
3. The proposed activities will not have an impact on unique characteristics of the
geographic area such as historical or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands,
