WS Wildlife Damage Management Methods
NON-LETHAL METHODS - NON-CHEMICAL
Agricultural producer and property owner practices. These consist primarily of non-lethal preventive
methods such as cultural methods and habitat modification. Cultural methods and other management techniques
are implemented by the agricultural producer and property owners. Producers and property owners are
encouraged to use these methods, based on the level of risk, need, and professional judgement on their
effectiveness and practicality. Producer and property owner practices recommended by WS include:
Cultural methods. These generally involve modifications to the level of care or attention given to the
resource which may vary depending on the age, size, and location of the resource. Husbandry practices
include but are not limited to techniques such as night feeding, indoor feeding, closed barns or corrals,
removal of spilled grain or standing water, and use of bird proof feeders (Johnson and Glahn 1994).
Animal behavior modification. This refers to tactics that alter the behavior of wildlife and reduce
damages. Animal behavior modification may use scare tactics or exclusion to deter or repel birds that
cause loss or damage (Twedt and Glahn 1982). Some but not all devices used to accomplish this are:
C Bird-proof exclusions and feeders
C Electronic guards
C Propane exploders
C Pyrotechnics
C Distress calls and sound producing devices
C Chemical frightening agents
C Repellents
C Visual scare devices
These techniques are generally only practical for small areas. Scaring devices such as distress calls,
helium filled eye spot balloons, raptor effigies and silhouettes, mirrors, and moving disks can be
effective but usually for only a short time before birds become accustomed and learn to ignore them
(Schmidt and Johnson 1984, Bomford 1990, Rossbach 1975, Graves and Andelt 1987, Mott 1985,
Shirota et al. 1983, Conover 1982, Arhart 1972 ). Mylar tape has produced mixed results in its
effectiveness to frighten birds (Dolbeer et al. 1986, Tobin et al. 1988).
Auditory scaring devices such as propane exploders, pyrotechnics, electronic guards, scare crows, and
audio distress/predator vocalizations, are often not practical under large feedlot situations because of
the disturbance to livestock, although livestock would habituate to the noise. Birds, too, quickly learn
to ignore scaring devices if the birdsâ€™ fear of the methods is not reinforced with shooting or other
tactics.
Bird proof exclusions can be effective but are often cost-prohibitive, particularly because of the aerial
mobility of birds which require overhead barriers as well as conventional netting. Exclusion adequate
to stop bird movements can also restrict movements of livestock, people and other wildlife (Fuller-
Perrine and Tobin 1993). Heavy plastic strips hung vertically in open doorways have been successful
in some situations in excluding birds (Johnson and Glahn 1994). Plastic strips, however, can prevent
filling of the feed troughs at livestock feeding facilities or can be covered up when the feed is poured
