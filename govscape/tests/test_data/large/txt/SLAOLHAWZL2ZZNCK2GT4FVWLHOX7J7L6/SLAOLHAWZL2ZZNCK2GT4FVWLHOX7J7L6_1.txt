Supplemental Permit Conditions 05-073-01r Page 2
3) Scouting for Weedy Rice
Ventria will scout for any weedy red rice within the Â¼ mile isolation zone. If found,
APHIS shall be notified as soon as possible but not later than within 5 working days
that it has been discovered and Ventria will take appropriate measures to destroy the
plants.
4) Weeds
Weeds in the field test plot will be controlled by herbicide treatment or by hand
rouging.
5) Perimeter Fallow Zone
To ensure that transgenic plants are not inadvertently commingled with plants to be
used for food or feed, a perimeter fallow zone of at least 50 ft. must be maintained
around the transgenic test site in which no crops are grown that will be harvested or
used for food or feed. The perimeter fallow zone must start outside of any permitted
border rows of non-transgenic plants that are the same as, or sexually-compatible
with, the regulated article, and it shall be managed in such a way as to allow detection
and destruction of volunteer plants that are the same as or sexually compatible with
the transgenic plants.
6) Dedicated Planting and Harvesting Equipment
To ensure that regulated articles are not inadvertently removed from the site, planting
and harvesting equipment must be dedicated to use in the permitted test site(s) from
the time of planting through the end of harvesting. After this time, APHIS
authorization will not be required for this equipment to be used on APHIS-permitted
sites planted to the same types of transgenic crops as authorized under this permit
(e.g. the same or different sites planted to the same crop with the same target
protein(s) in subsequent growing seasons under an extension of this permit or a
different permit), but authorization will be required from APHIS before this planting
and harvesting equipment can be used on sites planted to crops not included under
this permit. In the latter case, the permittee must notify APHIS, BRS and the PPQ
Regional Biotechnologist and State Regulatory Official at least 21 calendar days in
advance of cleaning this equipment for this purpose so that APHIS may schedule an
inspection to ensure that the equipment has been cleaned appropriately.
7) Cleaning of Equipment
To minimize the risk of seed movement and commingling, equipment used for
planting and harvesting, as well as other field equipment (e.g. tractors and tillage
attachments, such as disks, plows, harrows, and subsoilers) used at any time from the
time of planting through the post-harvest monitoring period must be cleaned in
accordance with procedures submitted to and approved by APHIS before they are
moved off of the test site. Equipment used to transport harvested material must also
be cleaned prior to loading and after transportation to the authorized site in
accordance with procedures submitted to and approved by APHIS. Seed cleaning and
drying must also be performed in accordance with the procedures submitted to and
