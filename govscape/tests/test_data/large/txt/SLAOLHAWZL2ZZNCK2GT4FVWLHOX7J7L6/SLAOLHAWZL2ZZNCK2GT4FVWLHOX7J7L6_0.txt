Supplemental Permit Conditions
FOR RELEASE OF TRANSGENIC RICE
USDA-APHIS-BRS Permit: 05-073-01r
1) Compliance with Regulations
Any regulated article introduced not in compliance with the requirements of 7 CFR
Part 340 or supplemental permit conditions, shall be subject to the immediate
application of such remedial measures or safeguards as an inspector determines
necessary, to prevent the introduction of such plant pests. The responsible party may
be subject to fines or penalties as authorized by the Plant Protection Act.
This Permit (APHIS form 2000) does not eliminate the permittee’s legal
responsibility to obtain all necessary Federal and State approvals, including: (1) for
the use of any non-genetically engineered plant pest or pathogens as challenge
inoculum; (2) plants, plant parts or seeds which are under existing Federal or State
quarantine or restricted use; (3) experimental use of unregistered chemicals; and (4)
food, feed, pharmacological, biologic, or industrial use of regulated articles or their
products and co-mingled plant material. In the latter case, depending on the use,
reviews by APHIS, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency may be necessary.
When the regulated article or associated host organism is found to have
characteristics substantially different from those listed in the permit application, or
suffers an unusual occurrence (excessive mortality or morbidity, or unanticipated
effect on non-target organisms), APHIS shall be notified as soon as possible but no
later than within 5 working days. In such cases, notice should be sent to:
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
Chief, Biotechnology Permit Program Operations, Rm. 5B53
4700 River Rd. Unit 147
Riverdale, MD 20737
The procedures, processes, and safeguards used to prevent escape, dissemination, and
persistence of the transgenic plants as described in the permit application, in APHIS-
approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and, in the supplemental permit
conditions must be strictly followed. The permittee must maintain records sufficient
to verify compliance with these procedures, including information regarding who
performed the activity. Persons performing such activities shall have received
training as described in a training program submitted to and approved by APHIS.
These records are subject to examination by APHIS. APHIS, BRS must be notified
of any proposed changes to the protocol referenced in the permit application.
2) Distance to other rice
To prevent cross-pollination of the transgenic rice with other rice, there must be at
least ¼ mile between the transgenic rice and any other rice not included under this
permit. This ¼ mile buffer includes a 50 foot fallow zone.
