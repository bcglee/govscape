Supplemental Permit Conditions 05-073-01r Page 3
approved by APHIS so as to confine the plant material and minimize the risk of seed
loss, spillage, or commingling.
8) Use of Dedicated Storage Facilities
Dedicated facilities (locked or secured buildings, bins, or areas, posted as restricted to
authorized personnel only) must be used for storage of equipment and regulated
articles for the duration of the field test. Before these facilities are returned to general
use, they must be cleaned in accordance with procedures submitted to and approved
by APHIS. In this case, the permittee must notify APHIS, BRS, the PPQ Regional
Biotechnologist and State Regulatory Official at least 21 calendar days in advance of
cleaning facilities for return to general use so that APHIS may schedule an inspection
to ensure that the facilities have been cleaned appropriately.
9) Post Harvest
As soon as physically possible following the fall harvest, the field must be burned and
disked, and may be flooded during the off-season, to degrade the plant material. If
weather does not permit burning, then the field must be disked as soon as possible.
An attempt should be made to schedule the harvests so that rainy conditions do not
prevent disking under the unharvested plant material.
10) Post Harvest Monitoring
For the cropping season following harvest of the transgenic lines, unless the fields
will be planted back into transgenic lines of the same target molecule (with the
appropriate APHIS permit), the field test site may be reflooded to promote growth of
any rice seed which may have escaped harvest the previous year. The field test site
and perimeter fallow zone must be monitored for volunteer rice plants monthly
whenever weather conditions are favorable for seed germination at least until
November, 2006, and volunteers must be eradicated by mechanical destruction or
with a herbicide prior to flowering.
11) Post Harvest Land Use Restrictions
Production of food and feed crops at the field test site and the perimeter fallow zone
is restricted during the growing season that follows harvest or termination of the field
test. Permission must be obtained from APHIS, BRS prior to planting any food or
feed crop at the field test site and perimeter fallow zone during the post-harvest
monitoring period. Requests for such permission are not encouraged and will not be
granted in cases where there is a reasonable potential for plant material derived from
or originating from the regulated articles to become mixed with the proposed food or
feed crop during harvesting.
12) Reports and Confidential Business Information
Confidential Business Information (CBI) will be handled according to the APHIS
policy statement at 50 F.R. 38561-63.
13) Pre-Planting Notification
