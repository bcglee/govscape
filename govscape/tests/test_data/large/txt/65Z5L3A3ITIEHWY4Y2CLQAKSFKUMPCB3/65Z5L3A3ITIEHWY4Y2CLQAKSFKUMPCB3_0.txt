CHAPTER 4.12.
SOMATIC CELL NUCLEAR TRANSFER IN
PRODUCTION LIVESTOCK AND HORSES
Article 4.12.1.
Preface
Following the first meeting of the OIE ad hoc Group on Biotechnology held from 3 to 5 April 2006,
the OIE Biological Standards Commission suggested restricting the mandate “to develop
recommendations on the animal health risks arising from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)
cloning of production animals, including criteria for assessing the health of embryos and animals
derived from such cloning.” The following Articles are a starting point for identifying, characterising
and providing a basis for discussion on the animal health risks associated with SCNT cloning
technology.
Article 4.12.2.
Overview
At the first meeting of the ad hoc Group on Biotechnology, it was recommended that the Subgroup
on Reproductive Animal Biotechnologies should draft recommendations on risk analysis, based on
the life-cycle approach, for biotechnology-derived animals. The definition of ‘Reproductive Animal
Biotechnology’ was proposed as “the generation of animals through the use of assisted reproductive
technologies (ART), which range from artificial insemination through to technologies involving a
significant in-vitro component, such as in vitro fertilisation, embryo transfer, embryo splitting and
including asexual reproduction such as nuclear transfer”. The following recommendations are
restricted to SCNT and are based on a risk analysis approach to biotechnology-derived animals
categorised according to the life-cycle approach consisting of: i) embryos, ii) recipients, iii) offspring,
and iv) progeny of animal clones.
Article 4.12.3.
Scope
These recommendations address animal health aspects of production animals derived from some
reproductive biotechnologies.
Recognising the mandate of the OIE and the suggestion of the OIE Biological Standards
Commission, it is the recommendation of the ad hoc Group on Biotechnology to identify risk analysis
parameters for animal health and their implication for environmental safety and food and feed safety.
These recommendations will focus initially on the scientific basis for the risk assessment aspects,
prevention measures and guidance for production livestock and horses derived from SCNT cloning.
