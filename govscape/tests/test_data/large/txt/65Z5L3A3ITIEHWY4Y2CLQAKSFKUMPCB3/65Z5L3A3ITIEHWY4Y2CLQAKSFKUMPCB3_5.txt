1. Oocytes
The laboratory or the producer should establish a detailed record of ovaries â€“ their origin, health
of the animal from which the ovaries are obtained, details of any systemic lesion on the animal
and proper herd data. This is particularly useful where the pooling of ovaries may provide cross-
contamination of ovarian tissue.
Follicular fluids may carry various infectious agents like bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and
can contaminate pooled follicular fluid from healthy animals. Furthermore, the technique for
collecting oocytes, such as aspiration or slicing of the ovarian follicles, determines the extent of
blood contamination or extraneous material. A representative sample to demonstrate the absence
of infectious biological material should be done with each pooled batch.
Oocytes are matured as cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) and then matured in most instances
in the culture/maturation media. Care and efforts should be taken to carefully select and mature
the oocytes from the pools that are morphologically good; also the media used should have been
quality tested. Use of serum or protein components from an undefined or untested source
should be avoided. Addition of proper and safe antibiotics in the culture media to control
opportunistic bacteria should be encouraged.
Use of proper sanitary and disinfection procedures is of utmost importance and should be
emphasised in any in vitro fertilisation (IVF) laboratory. Proper handling and following sanitary
protocols during the maturation and further culture of embryos should be encouraged.
2. Donor cells
In order to minimise risks:
- Donor cells should be properly harvested from the animal and cultured under proper
sanitary conditions using good laboratory practices.
- When applicable, the passaging of the cells used for the cloning procedure should be
documented and at different stage sampling may be warranted to look at the chromosomal
component of the cell lines. If possible, procedures should be in place for regular sampling
of the cells for morphological and other characteristics.
- Master cell lines (to be used for cloning at a later stage) should be stored under conditions
found to be optimal for maintaining viability. Freedom from extraneous agents should be
established by testing for bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas or viruses, using appropriate tests (see
Manual of the International Embryo Transfer Society [IETS]).
3. Cloning procedures/reconstruction
The cloning procedure that employs the use of chemicals or other reagents should be carefully
evaluated, in terms of the quality of embryos and overall efficiency.
During the fusion of recipient and donor material by chemical or physical means care and
control should be employed. The optimisation of the procedure based on the laboratory
protocols or published reports should be determined to avoid early embryonic mortalities.
