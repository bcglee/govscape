With respect to the animal health risks associated with the surrogate dam, it is difficult to
document the relative frequency of early stage losses of SCNT embryos compared with early
stage losses of other pregnancies as these abortions are not typically diagnosed with other
reproductive technologies. Additionally, external stressors will similarly impact SCNT
pregnancies.
Veterinarians should monitor the progress of pregnancy as the common gestational anomalies
seen in other assisted reproductive technologies may be exhibited and diagnosed during the
physical examination. A database of commonly encountered problems in clone pregnancies
would be useful if available to animal health experts.
- Care should be taken to assess the general health of the recipient dam before selection to
carry the embryo clones. The general health status of the recipient should be determined in
terms of freedom from infection and disease, proper vaccination and follow-up, and, if
applicable, proof of earlier uneventful pregnancies, absence of birthing problems, and proper
post-pregnancy recovery.
- Pregnancy loss is greatest with SCNT embryos prior to 60 days’ gestation in cattle. This is
similar to the pattern seen with other reproductive technologies. However, in clones, high
pregnancy losses during this time of placental formation (between 45–60 days) suggest that
embryonic death may be a consequence of faulty placentation. Abnormal placentation may
lead to a build up of wastes in the fetus and associated membranes, or inadequate transfer of
nutrients and oxygen from the dam to the fetus. Care should be taken to monitor the
recipient dam during pregnancy. Once the pregnancy is established and confirmed, regular
veterinary assessments and monitoring of animal health status is desirable up to the birth of
the offspring.
- To ensure that the recipient is pregnant and to monitor its health during the first trimester, it
is useful to perform ultrasonographic assessments, determine hormonal profiles and assess
the general physiological parameters. Based on these profiles, proper attention should be
paid to aid in the proper establishment of pregnancy by providing proper husbandry
conditions and nutrition.
- The animals should be observed carefully for the signs of labour nearing the time of birth. In
some species, one of the more common problems is uterine inertia and the absence of
contractions. The absence of contractions may result in prolonged pregnancies with
associated sequellae that may require assistance with deliveries.
- A surgical intervention should be decided and should be available for the near term animal if
the situation so warrants. Proper procedures should be employed to ascertain the proper
handling of the offspring and the surrogate dam.
- Health concerns may arise as a result of surgical procedures, excessive traction, or other
complications such as retained fetal membranes. In these cases post-partum care may be
necessary.
