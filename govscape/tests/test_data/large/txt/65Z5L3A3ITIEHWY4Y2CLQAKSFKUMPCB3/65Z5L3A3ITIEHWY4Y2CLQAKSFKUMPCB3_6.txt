If co-culture of the cell is used for the culture procedure after reconstruction of embryos, proper
screening of the co-culture cells should be done. A sample of each batch may be tested for the
bacterial, fungal, mycoplasmal or viral component.
Embryos should be cultured and harvested for an appropriate time and stage to transfer them or
to cryo-preserve them for later use. Proper procedures based on the international standards
(IETS Codes of Practice) for washing and preservation of the embryos should be followed.
Care should be taken with regard to grading the embryos before transfer (see Chapters 4.7. and
4.8.).

Managing animal health risks related to the recipients (surrogate dams)
1. Animal health risks to the surrogate dams
Currently, when compared with in vitro produced embryos, SCNT has a higher rate of pregnancy
failure and, in some species, placental abnormalities. Loss due to defects in the embryo or failure
to implant in the uterus of the surrogate dam does not pose a hazard to the dam. Rather, the
surrogate dam simply resorbs any embryonic tissue and returns to cycling. Mid- and late-term
spontaneous abortions may be hazardous to surrogates if they are unable to expel the fetus and
its associated membranes. Most abortions in natural service and artificial insemination (AI)
pregnancies in cattle remain undiagnosed due to the expense of laboratory work and the low
profit margin in both the beef and dairy industry. Producers and veterinarians become concerned
when the rate of abortion exceeds 3â€“5% in a herd. The same potential impact of external
influences should be considered with pregnancy evaluation with SCNT and other reproductive
technologies. Disease, under-nutrition, and severe environmental conditions are stressors known
to interfere with animal fertility and embryo survival. Under these circumstances, the risk to the
pregnancy is directly related to stress factors and not to the technology used.
To date, a species-specific effect has been seen. Abnormalities in clones may result from
incomplete reprogramming of the donor nucleus. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs at different
times in embryos in different species. Many of the abnormalities reported in cattle and sheep
pregnancies have not been noted in goats or swine carrying SCNT clones. The amount of in vitro
manipulation of an embryo inversely correlates to the chances for successful pregnancy
outcomes. This has been observed in both SCNT embryos and in vitro produced fertilised
embryos. Unlike other forms of other reproductive technologies SCNT pregnancy losses occur
at all stages of gestation in cattle. Clone pregnancies have been lost during the second and third
trimesters and have been accompanied by reports of hydrops, enlarged umbilicus, and abnormal
placentation.
2. Animal health risks posed by the surrogate dam to the clone embryos
No new animal health risks have been identified for the developing clone fetus from the
surrogate dam compared with conventional pregnancies. The latter include vertically transmitted
diseases and abnormalities due to metabolic or physiological stress.
