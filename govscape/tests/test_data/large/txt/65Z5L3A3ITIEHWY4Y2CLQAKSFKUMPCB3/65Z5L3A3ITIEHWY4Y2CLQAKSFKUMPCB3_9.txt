5. Managing animal health risks associated with re-cloning/clones of clones
Information on recloning is only beginning to appear. It is therefore necessary to follow the
approach below:
a) The health profile (health status and data on animal welfare) should be characterised to
consolidate the knowledge.
b) The reproductive performance of clones of clones should be monitored to assess the
capacity of the animals to perform in comparison with their conventional counterparts.
Article 4.12.7.
Review
The goal of this Chapter is to provide a scientific basis and recommendations on animal health and
welfare risks to animals involved in SCNT cloning compared with other ART. These
recommendations will focus initially on the scientific basis for the risk assessment aspects, prevention
measures and guidance for production livestock and horses, derived from SCNT cloning and should
be reviewed in light of new scientific information.
