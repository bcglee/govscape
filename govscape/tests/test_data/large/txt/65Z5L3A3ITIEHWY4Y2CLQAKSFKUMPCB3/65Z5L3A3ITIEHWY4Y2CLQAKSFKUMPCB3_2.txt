3. In the context of animal cloning, two broad categories of risk assessments are considered: absolute
risk assessment and comparative risk assessments. Absolute risk assessments characterise risk
independent of a comparator (e.g. the likelihood of an animal transmitting a specific livestock
disease). A comparative risk assessment (or relative risk assessment) puts the risk in the context of a
comparator.
For example the degree to which an animal produced by one reproductive technology can
transmit a particular disease to another animal of the same species compared with the degree to
which a similar animal produced by another reproductive technology transmits the same disease to
another animal of same species.
4. Regardless of the methodology used, hazard identification is an early step in all science-based risk
assessments. In the context of assessing the risks associated with animal cloning (SCNT) and
starting with the embryo and moving on through animal clone development and subsequent
progeny, it is important to be clear at this juncture that only a comparative semi-quantitative risk
assessment can be completed. A systematic, absolute, quantitative risk assessment of potential risks is
difficult, due to the relative newness of the technology, and the variability in outcomes among
laboratories and species cloned. Furthermore, with the technology of SCNT there is no
introduced hazard from the insertion of novel genes (which may potentially happen in
transgenesis). Thus, to analyse what factors contribute to animal health risks, the existing baseline
must be analysed.
5. In short, the specific points where the risk assessment needs to be focused need to be identified.
As illustrated in the accompanying diagram – the focus is to look at the basics of creating an
embryo – using current terminology, starting from the selection of donor of oocyte and the cells
to the creation of an embryo by the cloning methodology. The second phase will focus on the
recipient of the embryo clone and the animal health and care considerations for the animals. The
actual embryo clone that is born as an offspring is the third part of the paradigm that needs clear
recommendations for assessment, and the next generation, either the progeny of the animal
clone (which is a result of normal sexual reproduction) or animals produced by recloning (clones
of clones) is the fourth and final stage.

Managing animal health risks associated with embryos
Embryo production by in vitro techniques has been applied for many years. Although the additional
steps involved in cloning add a new dimension to this procedure, many of the risks associated with
SCNT have previously been identified for established ART (see Chapter 4.8.). An analysis of SCNT
methodology allows the procedural details to be categorised into:
a) Oocytes (obtained from the abattoir, recovered from trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided procedures
or by laparotomy procedures)
The primary risks are associated with the health status of the animal from which the ovaries are
harvested and the quality of the oocytes.
b) Donor cells (cells obtained from animals chosen to be cloned – by biopsy, harvesting at slaughter
or after death)
Currently there are no specific new risks identified with SCNT cloning. There is a proposed risk
related to activation of endogenous retroviruses during cell transfer procedures, however, this
