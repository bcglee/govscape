This is without prejudice to the addition of any relevant issue at a later stage. At present, these
recommendations include the following:
- identification of animal health risks and recommendations for management of those risks in
embryos, recipients, animal clones and progeny of clones;
- risk and prevention measures related with SCNT cloning technology;
- some welfare issues related to animal health.
Recognising further that the following issues have been discussed or may be addressed by other
bodies or instruments, or that they may be addressed at a later stage by the OIE, the document does
not address:
- safety and nutritional aspects of food derived from ART, for example transgenics (addressed by
Codex);
- risks related to the environmental release of animal clones;
- risks related to transgenic animals that have not involved SCNT or other cloning technology;
- non-reproductive animal biotechnologies;
- risks related to animals produced for xenotransplantation or organ donors;
- technologies related to stem cells;
- risks related to aquatic animal health, including fish clones;
- risks related to other terrestrial animals, such as wild mammals and non-mammals, including avian
species and insects.

Background: risk analysis â€“ general principles
1. Risk analysis in general includes hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management and risk
communication. The risk assessment is the component of the analysis that estimates the risks
associated with a hazard (see Chapter 2.1.). These principles are routinely used by regulators in
making decisions about experimental or commercial releases. These analyses can then be used to
determine whether the outcomes require management or regulation. Risk management is the
process by which risk managers evaluate alternative actions or policies in response to the result(s)
of the risk assessment taking into consideration the various social, economic, and legal
considerations that form the environment in which such activities occur.
2. For animal diseases, particularly those listed in the Terrestrial Code, there is broad agreement
concerning the likely risks and risks can be qualitative or quantitative (see Chapter 2.1.). In disease
scenarios it is more likely that a qualitative risk assessment is all that is required. Qualitative assessments
do not require mathematical modelling to carry out routine decision-making. Quantitative or semi-
quantitative risk assessments assign magnitudes to the risks in numerical (e.g. 1/1,000,000) or
descriptive (high/medium/low) terms.
