3. Managing animal health risks of animal clones
The health problems of individual clones can be observed in utero and post-partum. These appear
to be the same as observed in other ART, but they may be more common in clones. It is
important to determine whether the abnormalities are of genetic or epigenetic origin. Large
offspring syndrome (LOS), probably in relation to and placental abnormalities rather than fetal
abnormalities, have been are particularly observed in cloned cattle and sheep following
suboptimal in vitro handling. These abnormalities are becoming less frequent in small ruminants.
- Appropriate husbandry practices are important to the health of animal clones. Care should
be taken to provide colostrums and a clean and hygienic environment, supervision for the
first few weeks after birth should be practiced.
- The animal clones must be checked routinely for the most common phenotypic anomalies,
such as atresia anii, umblical hernia, flexor muscle contractions, respiratory or cardiac
insufficiency, and failure to suckle. This will allow proper treatment and care of the newborn
and increase the survival of the young one.
- To consolidate current understanding of the health status of animal clones, a comprehensive
veterinary examination should be performed to monitor the progress of the clone, as
unexplained fatalities or fatalities arising from systemic complications have been reported. It
is encouraged to follow the health profile of the animals to at least the reproductive maturity
stage, and to record the ability to reproduce (fertility index).
- Animal welfare concerns ranging from LOS to serious abnormalities are notable in the debates
pertaining to cloning technology. Proper research and peer-reviewed data should be
generated. The animal clones should undergo species-specific basic welfare assessments. If
welfare concerns are detected at initial screening, a more extensive characterisation of that
phenotype should be performed to document the animal welfare concerns.
- Proper monitoring of the animal population during different stages of life from birth to
puberty should be documented to address and validate the genomic potential of the animal
clones.
4. Managing animal health risks related to sexually reproduced progeny of clones
Presently there is no evidence of an increased health risk if sexual reproduction is used for
obtaining progeny. Some data indicate that the reprogramming errors during the cloning process
may actually be corrected during the natural mating and reproduction process:
a) Characterisation of the health profile, including health status and data on animal welfare,
would consolidate the knowledge of sexually reproduced progeny.
b) Monitoring the reproductive performance of sexually reproduced progeny of clones would
be useful to assess their reproductive capacity in comparison with their conventional
counterparts.
