Rural Business–Cooperative Service (RBS) provides research,
management, and educational assistance to cooperatives to
strengthen the economic position of farmers and other rural
residents. It works directly with cooperative leaders and
Federal and State agencies to improve organization,
leadership, and operation of cooperatives and to give guidance
to further development.
The cooperative segment of RBS (1) helps farmers and other
rural residents develop cooperatives to obtain supplies and
services at lower cost and to get better prices for products they
sell; (2) advises rural residents on developing existing
resources through cooperative action to enhance rural living;
(3) helps cooperatives improve services and operating
efficiency; (4) informs members, directors, employees, and the
public on how cooperatives work and benefit their members
and their communities; and (5) encourages international
cooperative programs. RBS also publishes research and
educational materials and issues Rural Cooperatives magazine.
