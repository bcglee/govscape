developed, and now capitalize on two IT-enabled innovations - process design
Summary
technology and distributed control systems (DCS).
a. Process design technology standardizes the project design, construction,
and equipping of ethanol plants. Included in that design and equipment is the
DCS.
b. DCS is the central nervous system of an ethanol plant. DCS facilitates the
consolidation of the business process management functions across many
plants or firms. DCS enables precise factor/product coordination from estab-
lished business/bio process metrics and benchmarking that is the result of a
massive data collection/analysis effort. DCS results/advantages include
sourcing/usage specifications, staff reduction, productivity gains, and cost
savings.
c. DCS enables the design/build firms to monitor/manage the operations of
many plants simultaneously.
6. Design/build firms offer a “one-stop ethanol shop” of ethanol business services
from feasibility to turn-key and beyond -- Hand-holding producer-investors
through the entire project process and providing operational contracts into 5th
marketing year with:
i. Marketing “partnerships” for ethanol and distiller grains.
ii. Procurement “contracts” for feedstock, energy, and inputs.
iii. Management “agreements” for operations/process benchmarking,
trading/risk mitigation, and market analysis/consulting.
7. IT enables design/build firms to practice dynamic specialization -- the digitaliza-
tion, decomposition, of activities for outsourcing
a. Supply chain management -- marketing and procurement
b. Product innovation/commercialization
c. Customer relationship management
8. IT enables design/build firms to weave together processing networks that
encourage coordination across enterprises, companies, and specialties that are
dispersed geographically, institutionally, and dimensionally, and are the basis for
using “productive friction” to build and accelerate capabilities.
9. By fostering standardization IT -- Strips costs out of system, squeezes time loss
out of system by speeding up construction time - groundbreaking to turn-key, and
reduces downtime - 320 to 360 days of operation per year. All of these things
reduced perceived risk of investment in ethanol plants and facilitates the flow of
capital into the industry.
