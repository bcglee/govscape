Abstract
This USDA-sponsored study used panels of ethanol industry experts and follow-up
interviews with plant owners and managers to examine how information technology
has affected the structure, organization, and operations of the fuel ethanol industry.
The study examined the following questions regarding the future of the ethanol indus-
try:
(1) Does the present ethanol industry represent a stable structure or a transition-
al step toward an inevitable concentration of ownership into the hands of a few large
processing firms?
(2) Have contemporary information technologies fundamentally changed the
information flows, scale of operations, access to markets, conditions of vertical and
horizontal coordination, sources of finance, and the competitive landscape for the
medium-sized, independent processing firm?
(3) To what degree have cost savings associated with better access to informa-
tion and financing offset the cost savings traditionally associated with horizontal and
vertical integration in processing industries?
(4) What steps do medium-sized ethanol production entities need to take to con-
tinue to survive in this new information-based market environment.
