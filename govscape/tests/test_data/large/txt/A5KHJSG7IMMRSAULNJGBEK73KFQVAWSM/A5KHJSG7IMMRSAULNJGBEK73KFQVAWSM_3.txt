USDA, Rural Development commissioned Informa Economics, Inc., of Memphis,
Summary
Tennessee, to conduct 2 panel discussions and 12 interviews with ethanol industry
participants and service providers to determine the impact of information technology
on the competitiveness of ethanol firms. Information from these panel discussions and
interviews was analyzed by a study team composed of experts from USDA's Rural
Development, Economic Research Service, the Office of the Chief Economist, the
University of Minnesota, and Informa Economics.
The principle discoveries from the panel discussions and interviews are:
1. Information technology (IT) has become a driving force in business operations,
strategies, structures, ownership, and performance.
a. IT innovations and applications have brought significant change to the nature
of business and its activities.
b. IT has altered industrial structure, conduct, and performance from vertical
“Command and Control” hierarchies to horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-
modal, collaborations that are “real time” sharing and distribution of knowl-
edge and work without regard for geography, distance, or language.
2. Structurally, the emerging fuel ethanol industry is uncharacteristic of typical agri-
cultural processing.
a. There is a fragmented balance of the traditionally dominant multinational,
agribusiness processing firms and the medium-sized farmer-owned, -operat-
ed, and -controlled plants.
b. Ownership of those mid-sized plants is dispersed from production activities.
c. There have been very few efforts among the largest firms to integrate or
assimilate the assets of other firms either vertically or horizontally.
3. The fuel ethanol industry has expanded four-fold and altered its structure signifi-
cantly since the mid-80s to early 90s:
a. Then the top 3 of a total 20 firms controlled 80 percent of production; annual
production capacity was about 1 billion gallons
b. Now the top 3 firms control 31 percent of production, and 44 of the remaining
71 plants are farmer-owned; annual production capacity is just over 4 billion
gallons.
4. Industry expansion and development was encouraged by a combination of fac-
tors including: Federal/State policies and incentives, a natural progression of an
emerging industry in a classic “production push” agricultural business model,
farmer-owned facilities and associated capital constraints, and oil prices $50+
per barrel.
5. The most prominent business development in the industry is the rise of the
ethanol “franchise.” These so-called “cookie-cutter” ethanol plants are offered
principally by two design/build firms, Broin, Fagen/ICM, who have adopted, . . . . .
