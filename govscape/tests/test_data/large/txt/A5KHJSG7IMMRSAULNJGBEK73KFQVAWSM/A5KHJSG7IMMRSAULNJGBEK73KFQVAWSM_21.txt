true that a number of intermediate uses for the coprod-

Another significant logistical impediment is the
rising cost of natural gas. The oil prices exceeding $60
per barrel, the days of cheap natural gas are behind us.
The huge demand base built when gas was cheap and
every project was powered by natural gas is largely the
main reasons for today's circumstance. Most new
ethanol plants are going in with the coal-fired or a
cogeneration plant to take advantage of $2 to $2.50, in
some cases less, in British thermal unit conversion
rates. However, 85 percent of the Nation's ethanol
plants use natural gas for the production of processing
steam and coproduct drying and remain at a signifi-
cant disadvantage.
The 10 percent mandated Reformulated Fuel
Standard (RFS) is now law in the United States. The
importance of decisionmakers and authorities to begin
taking steps toward lifting the encumbrances that
presently block the way is an important consideration.
But perhaps a more important issue is how will a 10
percent RFS affect the price of oil and gasoline? There
is a belief that a relatively small supply change can
have a significant price impact, perhaps more than
people realize. Because supplies are so tight, the
Nation has a 57-day supply of unleaded gasoline, on
the margin, small changes in supply can impose signif-
icant price adjustments. Even a two-day adjustment in
the oil inventory has traditionally had a major impact
on the oil prices.
Another looming concern is China's growing
influence in world energy markets. The Chinese econo-
my is growing in leaps and bounds and its energy
demands are increasing commensurately. China's
activities are already profoundly felt in world energy
markets. By some estimates, the Chinese have less than
a 20-day strategic reserve of oil. The nation has accu-
mulated cash with the expressed intent to purchase its
own oil company. In the immediate term, the Chinese
are expected to build their strategic reserve with any
favorable movement in crude prices.
An additional 5 or 10 billion gallons to the
domestic fuel supply may provide some relief. Some
