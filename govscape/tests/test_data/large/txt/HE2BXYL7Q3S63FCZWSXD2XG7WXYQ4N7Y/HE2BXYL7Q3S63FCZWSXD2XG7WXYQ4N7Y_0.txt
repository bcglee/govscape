INTEGRATED WATERSHED RESEARCH
Avenue Towards Sustainable Economic and Environmental Agricultural Production
USDA, Agricultural Research Service –J. Phil Campbell Sr., Natural Resource Conservation Center -Watkinsville, GA
PURPOSE RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES
•In order to efficiently utilize and protect our natural resources •Located within a typical Southern Piedmont landscape
we must understand what they are made of and how the •Cropped watersheds: P1, P2, P3, P4
pieces function in harmony •Grazed watersheds: W1, W2, and 14 at Dawson Field
•Integrated watershed research offers us an opportunity to do •Experimental watershed, an outside hydrologic laboratory:
just that through collection, documentation, interpretation and the North Unit with measurable springs, stream, ponds,
dissemination of basic data, information, and knowledge of and cropped and grazed catchments
watershed processes and function •Twelve instrumented water quality plots
•These activities serve as a basis for design, implementation, •Twenty six groundwater monitoring wells
monitoring, evaluating, and understanding watershed •Several full and partial weather stations
management practices and programs and their impact, and •Soil physical, chemical, and microbiological laboratory
to predict watershed response to alternative land use and facilities
management practices •Laboratory capability for map analysis using geographic
•Water flow creates a physical link between the land and information system and global positioning system
streams. Water is erosive, a solvent for nutrients, and a key •Interdisciplinary team
component of agriculture and natural habitats. To understand •Partners and Cooperators: UGA, EPA, NRCS, other ARS
our natural environment, we must know how water gets from locations, other universities, environmental groups, local,
land to streams and what it does in the process state and federal agencies involved in natural resource
issues, farmers and producer groups and commissions
