The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
Laurel Fork and McCammon Branch site. At pool elevation of approximately 1,060 feet above
mean sea level, there would be an impoundment of approximately 396 surface acres, and a
volume of 15,700 acre feet and a capacity of 5.1 Billion gallons of water. During average
drought conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 12.5 million gallons of water per day
and a yield of 7.8 mgd during worst drought conditions. This is well above the requirement of
3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.2.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
According to the 1999 Eco-Tech, Inc. field survey the following Endangered species inhabits the
area of the proposed reservoir:
• Villosa trabalis (Cumberland Bean) federally and KSNPC listed as Endangered.
Other Threatened and Endangered species known to exist in the Rockcastle River Drainage but
not identified by Eco-Tech, Inc. include:
• Pleurobema oviforme (Tennessee Clubshell) KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Percina squamata (Olive Darter) KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Villosa lienosa (Little Spectaclecase) KSNPC listed as a Special Concern.
• Etheostoma cinereum (Ashy Darter) KSNPC listed as a Special Concern.
