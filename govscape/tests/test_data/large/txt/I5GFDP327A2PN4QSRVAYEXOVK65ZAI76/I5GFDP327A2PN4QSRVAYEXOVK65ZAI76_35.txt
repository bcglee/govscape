The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
South Fork of Station Camp Creek and Rock Lick Branch site. At pool elevation of
approximately 900 feet above mean sea level, there would be an impoundment of approximately
770 surface acres, and a volume of 54,700 acre feet and a capacity of 17.6 Billion gallons of
water. During average drought conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 21.9 million
gallons of water per day and a yield of 13.7 mgd during worst drought conditions. This is well
above the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.4.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
The Karst topography and drainage patterns within this area create an ideal habitat for regional
bat species. Several Threatened and Endangered bat species have been identified within the
boundaries of the proposed reservoir including:
• Myotis sodalis (Indiana Bat) federally and KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus (Virginia Big Eared Bat) federally and KSNPC
listed as Endangered.
• Corynorhinus rafinesquii (Rafinesque’s Big Eared Bat) KSNPC listed as Threatened
(Eco-Tech, Inc., 1999).
