The logic of the yield estimates is as follows. All of the streamflow that occurs during the five-
month high demand period will be used to supply the demand. Furthermore, as much of the
reservoir storage volume as can be replenished during the refill period will also be used to supply
the demand during the high demand period. The sum of these two volumes, converted to an
annual demand rate in million gallons per day is estimated to be the yield of the site. This yield
estimate is high (because it does not take into account losses to evaporation and releases required
to provide streamflow to maintain downstream aquatic ecosystems), but it should be sufficiently
accurate to permit comparative evaluation of the thirteen sites in terms of their capability to
supply water for water supply purposes.
3.2 THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES
The Endangered Species Act provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants
that are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S. or elsewhere. Provisions are made for
listing species, developing and implementing recovery plans, and designating habitat that is
critical for listed species to survive (known as critical habitat). Mostly the Fish and Wildlife
Service (FWS) govern the Act, with some assistance from the National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
The purposes of the Act are to:
¤ Provide a means of conserving the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened
species depend.
¤ Provide a program for conserving those species.
¤ Take the steps necessary to achieve the purposes of the related international treaties and
conventions.
Congressional policy is that federal agencies must seek to conserve endangered and threatened
species and use their authorities in furtherance of the Act's purposes (16 USC 1531).
Critical habitat must be designated for each threatened and endangered species (referred to as
listed species). The designation must be based on the best scientific data available and take into
consideration the economic impact(s) and any other relevant impact(s) of specifying a particular
area. An area may be excluded if it is determined that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the
benefits of designation, unless it is determined that exclusion will result in extinction of the
species (16 USC 1533(b)(2)).
Species that are officially proposed to be added to the endangered and threatened lists are also
provided protection. Federal agencies are required to confer with FWS on any action that is
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species or result in the destruction or
adverse modification of proposed critical habitat (15 USC 1536(a)(4)).
All Federal agencies must insure that each action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or destroy or adversely modify any
designated critical habitat. In fulfilling these requirements, each agency is to use the best
scientific and commercial data available (Final ESA Section 7 Consultation Handbook, March
1998). Agencies must confer with FWS to determine if a listed or proposed species or critical
habitat may be affected by an action, what the effect(s) would be, and how the effect(s) could be
