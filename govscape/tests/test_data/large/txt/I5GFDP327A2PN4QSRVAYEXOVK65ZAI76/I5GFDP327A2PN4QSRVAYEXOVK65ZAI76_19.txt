According to the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans (SCORP) analysis, created
by the Division of Parks and Recreation, a surplus of facilities exists for certain recreational
facilities, including fishing, boating, water skiing, and canoeing in the study area of the proposed
Jackson County lake. The current facilities will adequately meet the demand for these activities
in the study area beyond the year 2020. However, the current facilities will be inadequate for the
increasing needs of camping, picnicking, hiking, and swimming facilities in the future. Based on
the current facility plans, a proposed Jackson County lake would help meet some of the needs for
picnicking facilities, and all of the needs for swimming facilities.
Based on the limited available data, current use of the regional lakes can be described as
moderate to heavy. Since population is expected to increase in the study area under moderate
and high growth scenarios, the proposed lake may help alleviate the potential heavy use of the
surrounding lakes in the future.
As suggested by the Corps of Engineers, lake size was used to predict potential lake usage. The
Rec. Needs study used the visitation figures represented in Table 2 to determine the potential use
of a Jackson County Reservoir.

*VISITOR HOUR - A visitor hour of use is the presence of one or more persons on an area of land or water for the purposes
of engaging in one or more recreation activities. Visitor hours of use will not include time spent by people passing over,
through or along the project, where such travel is unrelated to recreation activities.
**VISITS â€“ A "visit" is defined as one person visiting the project for recreation purposes for any period of time. For instance,
one person sightseeing for 15 minutes is 1 visit; one person camping for 14 days is also one visit. This number is available on
the VERS report. Round to the nearest hundred.
