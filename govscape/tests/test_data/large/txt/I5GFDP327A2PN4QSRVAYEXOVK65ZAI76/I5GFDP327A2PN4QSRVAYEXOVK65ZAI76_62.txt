The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
Sturgeon Creek site. At pool elevation of approximately 980 feet above mean sea level, there
would be an impoundment of approximately 370 surface acres, and a volume of 6,800 acre feet
and a capacity of 2.2 Billion gallons of water. During average drought conditions, there would
be a sustainable yield of 11.1 mgd and a yield of 7.0 mgd during worst drought conditions. This
is well above the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.13.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
There are no known federally listed threatened or endangered species in the proposed area. The
Villosa lienosa (Little Spectaclecase) has been documented from Sturgeon Creek (Eco-Tech,
Inc., 1999) but was not observed during the 1999 Eco-Tech, Inc. field study. This native mussel
has been designated as a species of KSNPC Special Concern.
4.13.3 Special Resource Designations
This portion of Sturgeon Creek does not have any status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act or
the Kentucky Outstanding Resource Water program (Miller, 1999).
