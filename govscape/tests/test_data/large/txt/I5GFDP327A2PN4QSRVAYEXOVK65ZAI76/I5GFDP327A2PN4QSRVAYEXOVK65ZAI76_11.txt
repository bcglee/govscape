But all alternatives that do meet these criteria of meeting the need and of being practicable, do
need to be studied as to their environmental impact. Even projects that cost somewhat more than
the least cost alternative need to be studied. This is because it often happens that the least cost
course of action also entails substantial environmental impacts. If an alternative could avoid
those impacts, but if it would cost only a little more, then that latter alternative might well be
regarded as “the best”.
As stated above, NEPA requires a process of broad consideration, but it does not dictate a
particular choice. However, another law that is relevant here is somewhat more restrictive. The
Clean Water Act requires permits for placing material in waters of the US. The dam will
therefore need a permit, issued by the Corps of Engineers. The regulations regarding that
permitting process are similar to NEPA’s, but they go somewhat further: they do in fact allow a
permit only for the practical alternative that has the least impact to the aquatic environment,
unless it has significant impacts on other parts of the environment. This can force a weighing of
different types of impacts against one another, but at any rate, the Corps’ permitting rules clearly
can force the selection of something other than the least cost alternative.
To comply with NEPA, therefore, the EIS must study the full range of alternatives that would at
least partly meet one or both needs, and which would not be unreasonably expensive or
impractical. NEPA also requires an EIS to study the “no-action” alternative, even though taking
no action generally does not meet a project’s purposes at all. The “no-action” analysis is useful,
however, in forming a basis of comparison for the other alternatives.
