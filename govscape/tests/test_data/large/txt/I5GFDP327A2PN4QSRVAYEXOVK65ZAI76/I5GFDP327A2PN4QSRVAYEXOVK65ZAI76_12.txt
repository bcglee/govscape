3.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA
3.1 YIELD
The most important factors in determining the selection of a reasonable alternative are based
upon the water needs of the region and the potential yield of a proposed site. The following
discussions detail the water needs and the methodology for determining the potential yield of a
possible reservoir site. For the purposes of this study, any site that does not produce water
sufficient to meet the need would be recommended for exclusion.
3.1.1 Water Needs
The study of present and future water needs of Jackson County is documented in the Draft Water
Needs Analysis for Jackson County, Kentucky, February 22, 1999, Commonwealth Technology,
Inc.
Quantifying Jackson County water needs from now until the year 2050 requires three types of
information. The first is water consumption rates, the second is population projections, and the
third is regional requirements. All three of these elements are subject to many factors that can
either increase or decrease their rates. As a result of the variance in water use and population,
ranges of plausible standards were used to determine water needs in Jackson County. Three per
capita use rates were computed for the water needs analysis: low, moderate and high. These
rates included water for residential, commercial, industrial, and public customers. Three
estimates of future population in Jackson County were used: low, moderate, and high.
Population projections were made for the year 2000 and every fifth year to the year 2050.
Projected water demands were computed by taking each population growth projection (low,
moderate, and high) and multiplying it by each of the three per capita water use rates (low,
moderate, and high). Growth projections were assumed for industrial demand and these
projections were added to the product for every fifth year from 2000 to 2050 to get a total
demand in gallons per day. Regional projections were based upon contact with surrounding
water associations and their potential use of a possible reservoir in Jackson County.
Currently, the two surface water sources of public drinking water originating in Jackson County
are Tyner Lake and McKee Reservoir. The Jackson County Water Authority (JCWA) acquires
its drinking water supply from Tyner Lake and the City of McKee uses the McKee Reservoir.
According to monthly operating reports, the average monthly maximum withdrawal from Tyner
Lake is 874,000 gallon per day (gpd), which exceeds the recommended maximum withdrawal
rate of 700,000 gpd (Kenvirons, Inc., 1998). The monthly operating reports on file for calendar
year 1998 with the Kentucky Division of Water (KDOW) state that the average monthly
maximum withdrawal from McKee Reservoir is approximately 201,600 gpd.
Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) has recently completed a multi-purpose
floodwater control and water supply dam on the Billâ€™s Branch tributary of the Pigeon Creek
watershed. This dam is called Multi-Purpose Structure #1 (MPS #1) and is located upstream of
