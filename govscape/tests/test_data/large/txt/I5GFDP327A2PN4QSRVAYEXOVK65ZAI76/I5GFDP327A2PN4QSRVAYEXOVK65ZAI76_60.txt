be a sustainable yield of 1.1 mgd and a yield of 0.7 mgd during worst drought conditions. This is
well below the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.12.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
There are no known endangered, threatened, or special concern plants or animals that have been
reported within the boundaries proposed reservoir (Eco-Tech, Inc., 1999).
4.12.3 Special Resource Designations
This portion of Travis Creek does not have any status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act or
the Kentucky Outstanding Resource Water program (Miller, 1999).
4.12.4 Recreation
Travis Creek at pool elevation would cover 452 acres. Using the calculations from Section 3.4
and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site would be
approximately 670,000 visitor hours per year.
4.12.5 Availability
No portion of the reservoir site is located on National Forest Service lands. Privately owned
properties would have to be acquired (USGS, 1983f, USGS, 1983c).
4.12.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance from Site 12 to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along
roadways, is approximately 7.5 miles.
4.12.7 Conclusion
The yield for this proposed site is below that required to be considered reasonable. For this
reason the recommendation is for this site to be excluded form further consideration.
