2.0 REGULATORY GUIDELINES
Whenever an organization, or a community, plans to take an action to meet a particular need,
ordinary common sense dictates that they seek “the best way” to proceed. To meet a given
purpose, they will consider at least some alternative courses of action, perhaps different locations
for the project, or different designs.
Study of factors such as the comparative costs, benefits and effectiveness of these different
alternatives leads to a sound decision as to which course of action is best. This is routinely done,
either formally or informally in every organization, in fact, in most people’s everyday lives.
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) merely builds upon this common sense
foundation. The law gives every Federal agency the responsibility to help protect the
environment through the actions that it takes, funds or permits. Accordingly, NEPA simply tells
agencies to add “environmental” costs and benefits to the list of factors that they look at in
choosing the best alternative. That is, NEPA calls upon planners to identify the environmental
impacts that could arise from each of the reasonable alternatives available, and then consider
those impacts alongside cost, effectiveness and other factors in order to identify “the best”
choice. Note that NEPA does not require agencies to choose the alternative that has the least
environmental impacts. NEPA does not dictate the outcome of the decision, merely the process
used to reach it.
The Environmental Impact Statement study done under NEPA, must therefore look at the
reasonable range of alternatives, and not merely the “least cost” or “most convenient” choices.
Determining the reasonable range of alternatives has very often been argued about in law courts.
Most of these arguments reduce down to two criteria:
• Does it at least partly meet the purpose(s) of the project?
• Is it practicable, i.e. could it in fact be carried out at a reasonable cost, in a reasonable
timeframe, with existing technologies?
Alternative sites, designs and so on for a project that would not accomplish the project’s
objectives at all, need not be considered. However, the project objectives need to be stated in
broad, fundamental terms rather than in such narrow terms that it biases the range of alternatives.
For example, this project’s purpose(s) can be appropriately stated as:
• Provide adequate water supplies for the JWCA and its customers for the next 50 years
AND
• Provide water-based recreation opportunities for the people in the Jackson County
area
It would have been unreasonable to narrow the possibilities at the outset by requiring that the
water be impounded on a particular stream.
As to the practicality of an alternative, this is a matter of common sense and judgement. Courses
of action that would cost many times what other alternatives cost, or alternatives which would
require technological breakthroughs, are not generally considered practicable. They need not be
considered.
