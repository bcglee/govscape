mitigated or minimized. This consultation process can be achieved in several ways, including
informal, formal, and emergency consultations and formal conferences. As a part of this process,
a biological assessment may be completed to report on such an evaluation. Biological
assessments are mandatory for actions that also require environmental impact statements. As
further means of implementing this coordination, Federal agencies often enter into partnerships
and Memoranda of Understanding with the FWS for implementing and funding conservation
agreements, management plans, and recovery plans developed for listed species (USFWS &
NMFS, March 1998).
The State of Kentucky also has biological species protection laws. The Kentucky Revised
Statutes (KRS) sections 150.183 and 150.990 protect endangered animals; KRS 146.600 through
146.619 protect endangered plants. These regulations cover species found in Kentucky with
restrictions, allowances, penalties, and other provisions similar to the Federal Endangered
Species Act provisions. The Kentucky State Nature Preserves Commission (KSNPC) lists
Kentucky species that are provided, or need, protection. The KSNPC lists each species as
endangered, threatened, historic, or special concern, which is a species that should be monitored
because:
¤ It exists in a limited geographic area.
¤ It may become threatened or endangered due to modification or destruction of habitat.
¤ Certain characteristics/requirements make it especially vulnerable to specific pressures.
¤ Experienced researchers have identified other factors that may jeopardize it.
¤ It is thought to be rare or declining but insufficient information exists for assignment to
the threatened or endangered status categories (KSNPC Homepage).
For the purposes of this study, an alternative would receive a recommendation to proceed only
with the absence of threatened, endangered, proposed, or other status species in or downstream
from an impoundment area.
3.3 SPECIAL RESOURCE DESIGNATIONS
The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 USC 1271-1287) (WSRA) established a method to provide
Federal protection for some of the country’s remaining free-flowing rivers, preserving them and
their immediate environments for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.
Rivers are included in the system to benefit from protective management and control of
development (NPS & FS, 1982). The Act’s preamble establishes this philosophy with the
institution of a national policy concerning these pristine rivers:
“It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that certain selected
rivers of the Nation which, with their immediate environments, possess
outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife,
historic, cultural, or other similar values, shall be preserved in free-flowing
condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for
the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Congress
declares that the established national policy of dam and other construction at
appropriate sections of the rivers of the United States needs to be complemented
by a policy that would preserve other selected rivers or sections thereof in their
