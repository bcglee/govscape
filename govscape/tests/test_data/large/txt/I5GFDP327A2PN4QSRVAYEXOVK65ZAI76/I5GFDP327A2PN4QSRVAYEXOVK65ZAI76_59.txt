The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
Travis Creek site. At pool elevation of approximately 1,100 feet above mean sea level, there
would be an impoundment of approximately 450 surface acres, and a volume of 29,400 acre feet
and a capacity of 9.6 Billion gallons of water. During average drought conditions, there would
