The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
Laurel Fork and Buzzard Branch site. At pool elevation of approximately 1,040 feet above mean
sea level, there would be an impoundment of approximately 750 surface acres, and a volume of
32,600 acre feet and a capacity of 10.6 Billion gallons of water. During average drought
conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 17.0 million gallons of water per day and a
yield of 10.6 mgd during worst drought conditions. This is well above the requirement of 3.0
mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.1.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
According to the 1999 Eco-Tech, Inc. field survey the following Endangered species inhabits the
area of the proposed reservoir:
• Villosa trabalis (Cumberland Bean) federally and KSNPC listed as Endangered.
Other Threatened and Endangered species known to exist in the Rockcastle River Drainage but
not identified by Eco-Tech, Inc. include:
• Pleurobema oviforme (Tennessee Clubshell) KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Percina squamata (Olive Darter) KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Villosa lienosa (Little Spectaclecase) KSNPC listed as a Special Concern.
• Etheostoma cinereum (Ashy Darter) KSNPC listed as a Special Concern.
