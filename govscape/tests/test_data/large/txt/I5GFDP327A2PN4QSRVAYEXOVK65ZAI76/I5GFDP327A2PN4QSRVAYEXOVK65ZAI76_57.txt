• Villosa lienosa (Little Spectaclecase) KSNPC Special Concern.
Plant species potentially impacted by the flooding of the area include:
• Taxus canadensis (Canadian Yew) KSNPC Threatened.
• Spiranthes lucida (Shining Ladies’-Tresses) KSNPC Threatened.
• Saxifraga micranthidifolia (Lettuce-Leaf Saxifrage) KSNPC Endangered.
• Dryopteris carthusiana (Spinulose Wood Fern) KSNPC Special Concern.
4.11.3 Special Resource Designations
This area is under Study River status for possible inclusion under the Federal Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act. Further, the U.S. Forest Service has recommended to the Department of
Interior/National Park Service that the portion of War Fork between Turkey Foot campground
and the mouth of the South Fork of Station Camp Creek be included in the National Wild and
Scenic River System. This alternative lies within these boundaries and has the protection
provided for a Study River (Miller, 1999).
4.11.4 Recreation
South Fork and War Fork at pool elevation would cover 1,171 acres. Using the calculations
from Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this
site would be approximately 2,270,000 visitor hours per year.
4.11.5 Availability
Approximately 70% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1987b, USGS, 1983c).
4.11.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance from Site 11 to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along
roadways, is approximately 18.5 miles.
4.11.7 Conclusion
The yield for this alternative is well above the necessary requirement. However, due to Study
River status of this portion of War Fork, the recommendation is for this alternative to be
excluded from further consideration.
