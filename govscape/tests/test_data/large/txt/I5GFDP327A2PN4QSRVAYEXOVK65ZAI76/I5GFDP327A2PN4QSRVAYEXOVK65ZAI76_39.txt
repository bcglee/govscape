Other species identified during the Eco-Tech, Inc. field study were:
• Villosa lienosa (Little Spectaclecase) KSNPC Special Concern.
Plant species potentially impacted by the flooding of the area include:
• Taxus canadensis (Canadian Yew) KSNPC Threatened.
• Spiranthes lucida (Shining Ladies’-Tresses) KSNPC Threatened.
4.5.3 Special Resource Designations
The South Fork of Station Camp Creek has been a Study River for possible inclusion in the Wild
& Scenic River system. Even though the Forest Service’s recommendation is to not include this
river in the system, the Study status of the river excludes it from further consideration (Hersel
1999).
4.5.4 Recreation
South Fork and Cavanaugh Creek #2 at pool elevation of 710 acres, using the calculations from
Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site
would be approximately 1,270,000 visitor hours per year.
4.5.5 Availability
Approximately 25% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1987b; USGS, 1987a).
4.5.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 20 miles.
4.5.7 Conclusion
The yield for this alternative is well above the necessary requirement. However, due to Study
River status of this portion of South Fork, the recommendation is for this alternative to be
excluded from further consideration.
