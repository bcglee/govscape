Plant species potentially impacted by the reservoir construction include:
• Taxus Canadensis (Canadian Yew) KSNPC Threatened.
• Saxifraga micranthidifolia (Lettuce-Leaf Saxifrage) KSNPC Endangered.
• Dryopteris carthusiana (Spinulose Wood Fern) KSNPC Special Concern (Eco-Tech,
Inc., 1999).
4.9.3 Special Resource Designations
This area is under Study River status for possible inclusion under the Federal Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act. Further, the U.S. Forest Service has recommended to the Department of
Interior/National Park Service that the portion of War Fork between Turkey Foot campground
and the mouth of the South Fork of Station Camp Creek be included in the National Wild and
Scenic River System. This alternative lies within these boundaries and should be excluded from
further consideration (Hersel, 1999).
4.9.4 Recreation
War Fork and Alcorn Branch at pool elevation would cover 156 acres. Using the calculations
from Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this
site would be approximately 140,000 visitor hours per year.
4.9.5 Availability
Approximately 80% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1987b; USGS, 1983c).
4.9.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 18 miles.
4.9.7 Conclusion
The yield for this alternative is well above the necessary requirement. However, due to Study
River status of this portion of War Fork, the recommendation is for this alternative to be
excluded from further consideration.
