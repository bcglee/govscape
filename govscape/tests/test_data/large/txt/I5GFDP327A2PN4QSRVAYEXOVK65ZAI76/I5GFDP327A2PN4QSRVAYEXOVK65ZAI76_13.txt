the City of McKeeâ€™s current reservoir. The total land area affected by the structure (dam,
emergency spillway, and rural water supply pool) is 28 acres and reservoir storage volume is 367
acre-ft. The rural water supply pool covers about 19 acres surface area, with a volume of 203
acre-ft. This would provide a yield of 271,000 gallons per day (USDA, NRCS, 1990). The
combination of the water yield from MPS#1, Tyner reservoir, and McKee reservoir would result
in a maximum sustainable yield of approximately one million gallons per day.

2050 2.6 3.5 5.4
Table 1, taken from Water Needs Analysis for Jackson County, Kentucky, illustrates projected
water needs for Jackson County under three different growth and water use scenarios. Table 1
indicates that Jackson County will have a water need of from 2.6 to 5.4 millions of gallons per
day by the year 2050. For the purposes of this study, a figure of 3.0 million gallons per day will
be used. This figure was derived by subtracting the approximate 1.0 mgd presently available
from the moderate growth of 3.5 mgd (see Table 1 Year 2050) resulting in 2.5 mgd. Because
this figure does not factor in evaporation and instream flow requirements, it is raised to 3.0 mgd.
Therefore, 3.0 mgd is used as the screening criterion. Any reservoir site that would not produce
at least 3.0 mgd should not be studied further. Any site that does produce that much should be
studied.
3.1.2 Water Yield
For the screening of potential sites to be meaningful (in the sense that the comparative evaluation
of sites in the screening investigation produces the same, or nearly the same, ranking as would be
produced in a more thorough planning investigation), the screening study needs to take into
account the streamflow characteristics of the sites as well as the specific physical characteristics
of the sites. Developing information on the physical characteristics of a site is relatively simple
if topographic maps are available, as they were in the case of the Jackson County sites. The
drainage area and the elevation-area-capacity relationships were determined for each of the
thirteen sites using a digitizer and the topographic maps.
Determining the streamflow characteristics for the sites when there are no streamflow records at
any of the sites, as was the case for the Jackson County sites, is a more difficult task. Among the
data needed for determination of yield is information on the streamflow quantity and its seasonal
variation. Seasonal variation of streamflow, particularly variation with respect to expected
demand patterns for water withdrawal from reservoirs and with respect to the magnitude of
storage available at the reservoir sites, is a critical factor in yield determinations made in
advanced reservoir planning. Experience has shown that the extent to which a screening study
takes this into account is a measure of the reliability of the screening results insofar as their
utility in more advanced planning studies.
