5.0 CONCLUSIONS
As indicated earlier, the purpose of this alternatives study was to identify a set of reservoir sites
that would be worth studying in detail. From this set of alternative sites the Federal agencies will
choose, after the detailed EIS and engineering studies are done, the specific alternative site, if
any, to fund. Thus, the present report does not identify “the best” site; it only identifies the set of
reasonable sites. It does this primarily by eliminating the sites that are unreasonable. The
“unreasonable” sites are those which would not meet the need, or would clearly involve
significant legal and regulatory difficulties.
While the eventual choice made by the agencies must come from this list of reasonable
alternatives, this list is not necessarily static. As the subsequent detailed environmental and
engineering studies progress, one or more of these detailed study sites may be found to have such
substantial economic, engineering or environmental costs and problems as to warrant being
dropped from all further consideration. Conversely, it is also possible that as the detailed studies
progress, and more information about each site becomes available, it may emerge that one or
more of the sites that were screened out at this stage may be seen as being no worse than sites
which weren’t screened out. If that case arises, one or more of the screened-out sites may be
added back in to the list of sites for detailed study and consideration.
Table 30 summarizes the findings about each of the sites in regard to each of the screening
criteria.
Based on this summary, the following sites can be screened out as unreasonable because they
would not meet even minimum water needs:
• Alternative # 7- McCammon Branch
• Alternative # 8- Mill Creek
• Alternative # 12- Travis Creek
The following sites can be screened out based on the known presence of a Federal Endangered
Species:
• Alternative # 1- Laurel Fork & Buzzard Branch
• Alternative # 2- Laurel Fork & McCammon Branch
• Alternative # 3- Horse Lick Creek
• Alternative # 7- McCammon Branch
The following sites can be screened out because of their legal protection under the Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act or Outstanding Resource Water:
• Alternative # 1 - Laurel Fork & Buzzard Branch
• Alternative # 2 - Laurel Fork & McCammon Branch
• Alternative # 3 - Horse Lick Creek
• Alternative # 4 – South Fork and Rock Lick
• Alternative # 5 – South Fork and Cavanuagh Creek #2
