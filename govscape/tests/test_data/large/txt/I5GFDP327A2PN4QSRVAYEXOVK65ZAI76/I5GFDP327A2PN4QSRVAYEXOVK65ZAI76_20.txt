Table 3 summarizes potential usage estimates. As shown in the example, Martins Fork Lake was
used as the model for a projected 300 acre lake. The average of Martins Fork Lake and Carr
Fork Lake was used as the model for a 600 acre lake. The average of Carr Fork Lake and Dewey
Lake was used as the model for a 900 acre lake. And finally, the average of Dewey Lake,
Paintsville Lake, and Buckhorn Lake was used to estimate usage for a 1200 acre lake. The
calculation used was as follows: 300 acres/340 acres X 400,000 visitor hours = 353,000 visitor
hours.
Table 3. Estimated Usage of a Potential Jackson County Lake.
Size in acres Average use per acre Projected Use (visitor hours/year)
300 1,175 353,000
600 1,750 1,057,000
900 1,850 2,115,000
1200 1,950 2,337,000
Overall, there is a demand for recreational facilities in the region. This demand is likely to
increase with population growth in the region. Additionally, this growth could be further spurred
by the economic impacts associated with the Empowerment Zone. Using the Comparison of
Visitor Hours and Lake Size analysis, it is possible to forecast a sizable level of visitation to a
proposed lake in Jackson County (Mangi Environmental Group, Inc., 1998).
For the purposes of this study, recreational need would not determine the suitability of one
alternative over the other. However, the study will try and present a potential utilization figure to
be used as a factor and not as an exclusion.
3.5 AVAILABILITY (LAND AND WATER RIGHTS, PERMITS, ETC.)
Legal, regulatory and institutional issues can severely delay or even prevent a water development
project from being implemented. Necessary land and water rights must be acquired, and in some
cases defended in litigation; permits from federal, state, and local agencies obtained; and
approvals from other localities obtained in cases of a project located outside the boundaries of
the projectâ€™s owner. An alternative may be considered unavailable if legal, regulatory, or
institutional obstacles are insurmountable (e.g., the USACE, EPA, State Water Control Board, or
another state, federal, or local agency determines that an alternative is not permitted). Any
determination of unavailability will be based on documentation of severe delays, uncertainties
associated with potential permit denials, or other insurmountable legal or institutional
constraints.
As a result, it would be impossible to determine the ultimate success or failure in acquiring lands
for the purpose of a reservoir. This study, therefore will simply detail the types of land available
and present this as a factor and not as an exclusion.
