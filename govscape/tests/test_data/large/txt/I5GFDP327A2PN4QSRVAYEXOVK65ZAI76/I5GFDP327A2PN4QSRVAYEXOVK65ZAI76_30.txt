â€¢ Ophiogomphus howei (Pygmy Snaketail) KSNPC listed as a Special Concern.
4.2.3 Special Resource Designations
The State of Kentucky has designated this portion of the Laurel Fork River as an Outstanding
Resource Water (Miller, 1999).
4.2.4 Recreation
Laurel Fork and McCammon Branch at pool elevation would cover 395 acres. Using the
calculations from Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational
usage of this site would be approximately 540,000 visitor hours per year.
4.2.5 Availability
Approximately 35% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1983c; USGS, 1989).
4.2.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 7.5 miles.
4.2.7 Conclusion
Although the yield for this alternative would be well above that required, the presence of
threatened or endangered species, especially the Cumberland Bean, and the Outstanding
Resource Water designation would make this a difficult alternative to pursue. The
recommendation is that this proposal be excluded from consideration.
