The Average End Area Method
Using a topographic chart depicting the proposed impoundment:
1. The area of the enclosed by the lowest contour line within the proposed impoundment is
determined using a digitizing pallet and cad program.
2. The area enclosed by the next higher contour line is determined as in 1. above.
3. The areas determined in 1. and 2. above are added, and the average value determined by
dividing by 2.
4. The average area determined in steps 1, 2, and 3 is then multiplied by the contour interval to
give the approximate volume of the proposed reservoir when filled to the level of the 2nd
contour line.
5. The area enclosed by the 3rd contour line is determined and averaged with the area
determined for the 2nd contour line to give the volume of the proposed reservoir between
these contour lines. And the two volumes are summed to give the volume of the proposed
reservoir when filled to the level of the 3rd contour line.
6. The method outlined above is continued until the last contour line enclosed by the height the
proposed dam has been calculated.
7. To formulate a stage capacity curve the volume of water, as calculated with the above
method, below each contour line in the proposed lake, is plotted on the vertical axis of a set
of Cartesian coordinates. The water levels or “pool stages” are plotted horizontal axis of
these coordinates. A curve can then be plotted that will yield the approximate volume at any
pool stage.
