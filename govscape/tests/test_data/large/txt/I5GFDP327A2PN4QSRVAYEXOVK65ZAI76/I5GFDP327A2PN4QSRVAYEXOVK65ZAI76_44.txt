The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
McCammon Branch site. At pool elevation of approximately 1,160 feet above mean sea level,
there would be an impoundment of approximately 280 surface acres, and a volume of 17,000
acre feet and a capacity of 5.5 Billion gallons of water. During average drought conditions, there
would be a sustainable yield of 3.7 mgd and a yield of 2.3 mgd during worst drought conditions.
The sustainable yield meets the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable, however,
worst drought conditions fall below the requirement.
4.7.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
There are no known endangered, threatened, or special concern plants or animals that have been
reported within the boundaries of the proposed reservoir (Eco-Tech, Inc., 1999). There are,
however, reported Villosa trabalis (Cumberland Bean) downstream of the proposed site.
4.7.3 Special Resource Designations
This portion of McCammon Branch does not have any status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act or the Kentucky Outstanding Resource Water program. However, the waters of McCammon
Branch feed into waters that the State of Kentucky has designated as an Outstanding Resource
Water (Miller, 1999).
