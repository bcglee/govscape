4.3.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
Several Threatened and Endangered species of bivalve mussels have been identified within the
boundaries of the proposed reservoir. Threatened and Endangered mussels known to inhabit
Horse Lick Creek include:
• Villosa trabalis (Cumberland Bean) federally and KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Pegias fabula (Little-Wing Pearly Mussel) federally and KSNPC listed as
Endangered.
• Toxolasma lividus (Purple Lilliput) KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Ptychobranchus subtentum (Fluted Kidneyshell) KSNPC listed as Threatened.
• Pleurobema oviforme (Tennessee Clubshell) KSNPC listed as Endangered.
The following plant species have also been identified at the site and may be impacted by the
construction of the reservoir:
• Vallisneria americana (Eel-Grass) listed as a species of KSNPC special concern.
4.3.3 Special Resource Designations
The State of Kentucky has designated this portion of Horse Lick Creek as an Outstanding
Resource Water (Miller, 1999).
4.3.4 Recreation
Horse Lick Creek at pool elevation would cover 422 acres. Using the calculations from Section
3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site would be
approximately 600,000 visitor hours per year.
4.3.5 Availability
Approximately 60% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1983b; USGS, 83d; USGS, 83e; USGS, 83a).
4.3.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 18.5 miles.
4.3.7 Conclusion
Although the yield for this alternative would be well above that required, the presence of
threatened or endangered species - especially the Cumberland Bean - and the Outstanding
Resource Water designation would make this a difficult alternative to pursue. The
recommendation is that this proposal be excluded from consideration.
