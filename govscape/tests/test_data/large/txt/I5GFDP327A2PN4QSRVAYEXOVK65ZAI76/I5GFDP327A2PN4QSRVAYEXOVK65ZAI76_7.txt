1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND
This report documents the analysis to identify and screen alternatives for a proposed dam and
reservoir project in Jackson County, Kentucky. The purpose of the analysis is to select a list of
reasonable alternatives from all the alternatives identified so far. The selected alternatives would
be studied further in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as required by the National
Environmental Policy Act, 1969 (NEPA).
The Empowerment Zone (EZ) is an initiative to empower rural communities to create jobs and
opportunities through federal/state/and local government, and private-sector partnerships. The
Empowerment Zone was initiated as part of Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1993; Subchapter C, Part 1 - Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities and Rural
Development Investment Areas. The Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC)
manages the Kentucky Highland Empowerment Zone and its activities.
The Jackson County Lake Project (Project), is one of the proposed initiatives developed for the
Kentucky Highlands EZ. Originally included in the proposal is the raw water intake and pumps,
a water treatment plant upgrade from 1.0 million gallons per day (mgd) to 2.0 mgd, and pipelines
necessary for transporting raw water to the Jackson County Water Association’s water treatment
plant for treatment and distribution to residents in Jackson County and portions of Lee, Madison,
Owsley, and Rockcastle Counties. The primary purpose of the project is to improve the water
supply to these service areas. In addition, the Project will serve to meet a stated goal of the
Kentucky Highland Empowerment Zone’s Strategic Plan (Collins and Eller, Date unknown) for
increasing local recreational and tourism opportunities in the Jackson County area.
This study takes the original project description a step further. From other referenced studies
involving water and recreational need analysis, a water need has been projected to the year 2050.
This study assesses potential reservoir sites as “Reasonable Alternatives” for inclusion in an
Environmental Impact Statement.
1.2 LITERATURE REVIEW
To develop the methodology and evaluation criteria for this alternatives screening analysis,
related environmental studies were reviewed for comparison. The EISs reviewed include:
1. Recreational Lake and Complex on Porter Creek, Franklin County, Mississippi
(USFS, May 1998 Final )
2. Randleman Lake, Guilford and Randolph Counties, North Carolina (USACE, June
1997 Draft)
3. Regional Raw Water Study Group, Lower Virginia Peninsula Regional Raw Water
Supply Plan (USACE, February 1994 Draft)
The Porter Creek EIS covers a proposed lake to improve the economic condition through nature-
based tourism and recreation. The EIS considered seven alternatives, including lakes of various
