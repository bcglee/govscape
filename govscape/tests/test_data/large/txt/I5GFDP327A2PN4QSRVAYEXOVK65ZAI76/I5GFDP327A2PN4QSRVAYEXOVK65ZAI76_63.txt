4.13.4 Recreation
Sturgeon Creek at pool elevation would cover 368 acres. Using the calculations from Section
3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site would be
approximately 480,000 visitor hours per year.
4.13.5 Availability
No portion of the reservoir site is located on National Forest Service lands. Privately owned
properties would have to be acquired (USGS, 1983f).
4.13.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 5.5 miles.
4.13.7 Conclusion
The yield of this alternative is well above the necessary requirement. There are no known
threatened or endangered species. The waters have not been granted any special designations.
The only possible negative is the requirement for acquisition of privately owned lands, which is
not exclusionary. For this reason, the recommendation is to include this proposal as a
Reasonable Alternative.
