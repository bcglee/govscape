Other species identified during the Eco-Tech, Inc. field study were:
• Villosa lienosa (Little Spectaclecase) KSNPC Special Concern.
Plant species potentially impacted by the flooding of the area include:
• Taxus canadensis (Canadian Yew) ) KSNPC Threatened.
• Spiranthes lucida (Shining Ladies’-Tresses) KSNPC Threatened.
4.4.3 Special Resource Designations
The South Fork of Station Camp Creek is a Study River for possible inclusion in the Wild &
Scenic River system. Even though the Forest Service’s recommendation is to not include this
river in the system, the Study status of the river remains in effect until removed (Hersel 1999).
The recommendation is that this proposal be excluded from consideration.
4.4.4 Recreation
The reservoir located on the South Fork of Station Camp Creek and Rock Lick at pool elevation
would cover 768 acres. Using the calculations from Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated
usage, the potential recreational usage of this site would be approximately 1,380,000 visitor
hours per year.
4.4.5 Availability
Approximately 30% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1987b; USGS, 1987a).
4.4.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 23 miles.
4.4.7 Conclusion
The yield for this alternative is well above the necessary requirement. However, due to Study
River status of this portion of South Fork, the recommendation is for this alternative to be
excluded from further consideration.
