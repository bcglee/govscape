The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
War Fork and Alcorn Branch site. At pool elevation of approximately 800 feet above mean sea
level, there would be an impoundment of approximately 155 surface acres, and a volume of
6,500 acre feet and a capacity of 2.1 Billion gallons of water. During average drought
conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 9.1 mgd and a yield of 7.3 mgd during worst
drought conditions. This is well above the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.9.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
The Karst topography and drainage patterns within this area create an ideal habitat for regional
bat species (USFS, 1996). A survey completed by John MacGregor, T&E Specialist for the
Daniel Boone National Forest, identified a significant concentration of colonies and
hibernaculums in this drainage which include:
• Myotis sodalis (Indiana Bat) federally and KSNPC Endangered.
• Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus (Virginia Big Eared Bat) KSNPC Endangered.
• Corynorhinus rafinesquii (Rafinisque Big Eared Bat) KSNPC Threatened.
