The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
South Fork and War Fork site. At pool elevation of approximately 800 feet above mean sea
level, there would be an impoundment of approximately 1,170 surface acres, and a volume of
60,000 acre feet and a capacity of 19.7 Billion gallons of water. During average drought
conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 46.5 mgd and a yield of 29.1 mgd during worst
drought conditions. This is well above the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.11.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
The Karst topography and drainage patterns within this area create an ideal habitat for regional
bat species. Several Threatened and Endangered bat species have been identified within the
boundaries of the proposed reservoir including
• Myotis sodalis (Indiana Bat) federally and KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus (Virginia Big Eared Bat) federally and KSNPC
listed as Endangered.
• Corynorhinus rafinesquii (Rafinesque’s Big Eared Bat) KSNPC listed as Threatened
(Eco-Tech, Inc., 1999).
Other species identified during the Eco-Tech, Inc. field study were:
