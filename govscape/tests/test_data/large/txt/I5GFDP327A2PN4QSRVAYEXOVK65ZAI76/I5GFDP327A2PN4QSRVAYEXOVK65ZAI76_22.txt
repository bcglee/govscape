4.0 RESERVOIR SITE ALTERNATIVES
Section 4 describes the physical characteristics and location of each site, water needs/reservoir
yield information, river resource designations, the existence of Threatened and Endangered
species, recreational needs information, land availability, and distance to the Water Treatment
Plant.
Each section is arranged in the following manner:
¤ Introduction: This section introduces the proposal accompanied with charts to assist
the reader in the location of the potential impoundment. All information pertaining
reservoir location has been acquired via 7.5 minute series (topographic) quadrangle
maps provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
¤ Yield Analysis: This section describes the estimated yield of the potential
impoundment. Pool elevation, watershed size, capacity and volume are displayed in
two graphs. A third table presents the yield analysis in average and worst drought
conditions. These depictions are followed by a discussion. The terms used in the
third table are defined in the following sentences. Runoff is something that runs off,
as rain in excess of the amount absorbed by the ground. Refill is to fill again. Yield
is to give in return, produce as a result, profit, etc., and drawdown is the lowering of
the water level of a well, reservoir, etc. Although meeting the need at some of the
sites would require greater seasonal drawdowns than at other sites, the amount of
drawdown was not used as a screening factor for this study. For those sites to be
studied in detail, the amount of drawdown will be one of many evaluative factors that
must be considered.
¤ Threatened or Endangered Species: This section gives a brief description of any
Threatened, Endangered, or otherwise protected species found within or downstream
of the proposed impoundment. All information concerning all species was gathered
by Eco-Tech through a literature search, with the exception of the information
concerning Villosa trabalis (Cumberland Bean Pearly Mussel), which Eco-Tech
gained by a field survey. The literature and methodologies used are discussed in Eco-
Tech’s Endangered Species Screening Study and Field Survey for the Cumberland
Bean Pearly Mussel for a Proposed Reservoir in Jackson County, Kentucky.
¤ Special Resource Designations: This section describes any special designation for the
waterway stemming from the Federal Wild & Scenic Rivers Act or Kentucky
Outstanding Resource Water program.
¤ Availability: This section gives a brief description of the type of land, public or
private, included within the potential impoundment.
¤ Distance to Water Treatment Plant: This section gives an approximate distance to the
water treatment plant along the most probable roadways. These are rough estimates
only, and were originally developed as a rough indicator of construction and
