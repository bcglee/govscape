Plant species potentially impacted by the reservoir construction include:
• Taxus Canadensis (Canadian Yew) KSNPC Threatened.
• Saxifraga micranthidifolia (Lettuce-Leaf Saxifrage) KSNPC Endangered.
• Dryopteris carthusiana (Spinulose Wood Fern) KSNPC Special Concern (Eco-Tech,
Inc., 1999).
4.10.3 Special Resource Designations
The U.S. Forest Service has recommended to the Department of Interior/National Park Service
that the portion of War Fork between Turkey Foot campground and the mouth of the South Fork
of Station Camp Creek be included in the National Wild and Scenic River System. This portion
of War Fork does not fall within the previously described area and therefore does not have any
status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act or the Kentucky Outstanding Resource Water
program (Miller, 1999).
4.10.4 Recreation
War Fork-Steer Fork at pool elevation would cover 378 acres. Using the calculations from
Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site
would be approximately 500,000 visitor hours per year.
4.10.5 Availability
Approximately 60% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1983c).
4.10.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways, is
approximately 12 miles.
4.10.7 Conclusion
The yield for this alternative is above the necessary requirement. Due to the presence of
potential bat habitat within this region, a bat survey should be conducted in order to definitively
include or exclude this alternative. Until such time as a bat survey can be accomplished, the
recommendation is to include this proposal as a Reasonable Alternative.
