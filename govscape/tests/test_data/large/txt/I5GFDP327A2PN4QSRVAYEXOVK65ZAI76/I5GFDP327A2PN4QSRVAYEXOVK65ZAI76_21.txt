3.6 DISTANCE TO WATER TREATMENT PLANT
The action involving the proposed reservoir includes an expansion of the existing water
treatment plant. The entire pipe network for the distribution system emanates from this
treatment plant. An expansion of the current facility would be more cost effective and have the
advantage of being able to take advantage of the current distribution system.
For the purposes of this report, the approximate distance along the most probable roadway route
from the proposed alternative site to the water treatment plant will be presented as a factor and
not as an exclusion.
