free-flowing condition to protect the water quality of such rivers and to fulfill
other vital national conservation purposes” (16 USC 1271(b)).
To be eligible for inclusion in the system, rivers must meet certain criteria judging how natural
the river segment is. These criteria are based on several factors, such as being free of
impoundments (dams, etc.), accessibility, and the amount of development of the riverbanks and
watersheds. Based on these criteria, a listed river section will be classified as wild, scenic, or
recreational.
The key to the WSRA is that it is only meant to protect specific outstanding resources of a river
portion, not the entire river, nor all the aspects of a particular river portion. This protection is
achieved through management plans, which are individually approved for each component of the
system (each listed river portion). These plans determine the kinds and amounts of public use
that the river area can sustain without impacting the values for which it was designated (NPS &
FS, 1982). It is vital to note that the Act and the management plans do not expressly prohibit or
limit development or activities along a listed river portion.
Study Rivers are those rivers or river segments that are under study by an agency to determine
their suitability for addition to the system (NPS & FS, 1982). The purpose of this study is to
provide information upon which the President can base a recommendation and Congress can
make a decision on whether to add it to the system. The study area usually must cover at least ¼
mile from each bank of the river. Adjacent river areas beyond ¼ mile may be studied if their
inclusion could facilitate management of the resources of the river area. Study Rivers are
granted even greater protection from development than listed rivers. This extra protection is
granted to make sure that any potentially suitable river segments are not degraded by
development before they can be listed and have management plans instituted.
Any river portions that meet the system’s eligibility criteria may be designated as potential
additions to the system. The National Park Service (NPS) adds these rivers to the Nationwide
Rivers Inventory (NRI). A Presidential Directive, signed in 1980, requires each Federal agency,
as part of its normal planning and environmental review processes, to avoid or mitigate adverse
effects on rivers identified in the Nationwide Rivers Inventory. Further, all agencies are required
to consult with NPS prior to taking actions that could effectively foreclose wild, scenic or
recreational status for rivers on the inventory. Rivers on the NRI may be Study Rivers or they
may be awaiting study status, having only been identified by the NPS as meeting the eligibility
criteria for inclusion.
USDA agencies have their own requirements concerning this Act and concerned rivers. The
USDA/Forest Service regulations protect listed and study rivers:
“No license, permit, or other authorization can be issued for a Federally assisted
water resources project on any portion of a Wild and Scenic River or Study River
nor can appropriations be requested to begin construction of such projects,
without prior notice to the Secretary of Agriculture, and a determination in
accordance with section 7 of the Act” (36 CFR 297.4).
