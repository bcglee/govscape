The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
Horse Lick site. At pool elevation of approximately 980 feet above mean sea level, there would
be an impoundment of approximately 422 surface acres, and a volume of 10,800 acre-feet and a
capacity of 3.5 billion gallons of water. During average drought conditions, there would be a
sustainable yield of 19.3 million gallons of water per day and a yield of 15.9 mgd during worst
drought conditions. This is well above the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
