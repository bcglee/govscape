RUS regulations for the WSRA, implemented when the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA)
was merged into RUS, are located at 7 CFR 1940, Exhibit E to Subpart G. The regulations
include:
¤ Each application for financial assistance or subdivision approval will be reviewed to
determine if it will affect a river or portion of it which is either included in the system,
designated for potential addition to the system, or identified in the Nationwide Inventory.
¤ If NPS or Forest Service (FS) advises that the proposal will have an unavoidable adverse
effect on a river segment which is either included in the system or designated for
potential addition to the system, the application will be denied.
¤ If NPS or FS advises that the proposal will have an adverse effect on a river segment
identified in the Nationwide Inventory, the reviewer shall further consult with NPS or FS
in order to formulate adequate measures or modification to avoid or mitigate the potential
adverse effect. The purpose of such measures or modification is to ensure that the
proposal does not effectively foreclose the designation of a wild, scenic or recreational
river segment.
In Kentucky, there is a similar system that provides additional protection and restrictions for the
state’s waters. The state’s surface water standards (401 KAR 5:031(7)) classifies certain waters
as outstanding resource waters (ORW). Surface waters that receive this classification include:
¤ Waters designated under the Kentucky Wild Rivers Act;
¤ Water that are listed on the Federal Wild and Scenic Rivers System;
¤ Waters identified under the Kentucky Nature Preserves Act; and
¤ Waters that support Federally recognized endangered or threatened species.
ORW status is not a use designation nor does it grant specific protection. Instead, waters with
ORW classification are eligible to receive potential protection measures, such as biological
monitoring, through the permit process. For instance, if an ORW waterway was found to have
declining fish populations, then use permits on that waterway may be suspended or modified to
repair the water quality. In addition, waters which have a national wild or scenic river
designation or have a resource that is considered extremely valuable are classified as outstanding
national resource waters, and do receive a higher level of protection (Schnider, 1999).
For the purposes of this study, an alternative would receive a recommendation to proceed only if
the alternative was free of any Wild & Scenic, Study Status, or Outstanding Resource Waters
designations.
3.4 RECREATIONAL NEEDS
A study of present and future recreational needs of Jackson County is documented in the
Recreational Needs Analysis for the Proposed Jackson County Lake Project, September 1998, by
The Mangi Environmental Group, Inc.
The proposed lake would primarily be used as a water supply reservoir for Jackson County and
perhaps the surrounding counties. Recreational use of the lake would be an added benefit.
Future recreational development around the proposed Jackson County lake may include a public
dock, boat landings, picnic and camping areas, and a public beach.
