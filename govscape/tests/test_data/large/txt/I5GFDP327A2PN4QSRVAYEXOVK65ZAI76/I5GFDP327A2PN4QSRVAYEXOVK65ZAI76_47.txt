The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
Mill Creek site. At pool elevation of approximately 1,140 feet above mean sea level, there
would be an impoundment of approximately 96 surface acres, and a volume of 4,800 acre feet
and a capacity of 1.6 Billion gallons of water. During average drought conditions, there would
be a sustainable yield of 1.4 mgd and a yield of 0.9 mgd during worst drought conditions. This is
well below the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.8.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
There are no known endangered, threatened, or special concern plants or animals that have been
reported within the boundaries of the proposed reservoir (Eco-Tech, Inc., 1999).
4.8.3 Special Resource Designations
This portion of Mill Creek does not have any status under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act or the
Kentucky Outstanding Resource Water program (Miller, 1999).
