operation cost. In the event that one or more of the sites had been found to be
significantly more expensive and clearly more inferior to all other sites, in every other
factor, then such sites could also have been screened out from further study. As it
happens, however, no sites could be ruled out on this basis. A similar rationale led to
the inclusion of recreational opportunity data. For this same reason, the recreation
data did not result in any sites being screened out. This data may be useful at a later
stage to aid in the comparison of alternatives.
¤ This section gives the study’s recommendation.
