The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
South Fork and Cavanaugh Creek #2 site. At pool elevation of approximately 820 feet above
mean sea level, there would be an impoundment of approximately 710 surface acres, and a
volume of 35,400 acre feet and a capacity of 11.45 Billion gallons of water. During average
drought conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 30.0 million gallons of water per day
and a yield of 18.7 mgd during worst drought conditions. This is well above the requirement of
3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.5.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
The Karst topography and drainage patterns within this area create an ideal habitat for regional
bat species. Several Threatened and Endangered bat species have been identified within the
boundaries of the proposed reservoir including:
• Myotis sodalis (Indiana Bat) federally and KSNPC listed as Endangered.
• Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus (Virginia Big Eared Bat) federally and KSNPC
listed as Endangered.
• Corynorhinus rafinesquii (Rafinesque’s Big Eared Bat) KSNPC listed as Threatened
(Eco-Tech, Inc., 1999).
