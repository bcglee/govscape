4.7.4 Recreation
For McCammon Branch at pool elevation would cover 281 acres. Using the calculations from
Section 3.4 and interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site
would be approximately 320,000 visitor hours per year.
4.7.5 Availability
Approximately 80% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands
(USGS, 1983c).
4.7.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance from Site 7 to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways,
is approximately 5.5 miles.
4.7.7 Conclusion
Although the yield for this alternative would be above that required limit during average drought
conditions, the yield falls below the required limit during worst drought conditions. For the
purposes of this study, the presence of a protected species, the Cumberland bean pearly mussel,
downstream of the proposed site would make this a difficult alternative to pursue. In addition,
stream waters that feed into waters with Outstanding Resource Water designation also contribute
to its exclusion as a reasonable alternative. The recommendation is that this proposal be
excluded from further consideration.
