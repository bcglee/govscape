surface areas at three different locations and the no action alternative. The proposed lake would
not be used as a water supply.
The Randleman Lake EIS was done on a proposed dam and reservoir to provide safe and
dependable water supply for the region. The EIS considered seven alternatives, including two
alternative reservoir locations, a combination of two reservoirs, purchasing water from other
municipalities, groundwater development, a combination of a reservoir and groundwater
development, and the no action alternative.
The Lower Virginia Peninsula EIS evaluated alternative actions to meet the region’s future water
needs. The EIS originally considered 31 alternatives, including new dams, new intakes on
existing reservoirs, combinations of different water sources, groundwater development,
desalination, wastewater reuse, use restrictions, and the no action alternatives. The alternatives
were screened in an analysis to rule out the ones that are 1) environmentally fatally flawed, 2)
unavailable based on permitting, host approval, or legal constraints, or 3) infeasible based on
cost or technological reliability. Only seven alternatives were considered in detail in the EIS.
Even though the proposed Jackson County Lake project is more similar in scale to the Porter
Creek and Randleman Lake projects, the alternatives screening process in the Lower Virginia
Peninsula EIS was adopted for this analysis because of the similarity in study approach. The
screening criteria for this analysis were modified to reflect issues relevant to the project area.

1.3 EVALUATION CRITERIA
A list of 13 alternative impoundment sites and associated flooded areas were identified by the
Rural Utility Service (RUS). A set of evaluation criteria are used to screen these sites for their
potential suitability to satisfy Jackson County’s water needs, environmental conflicts,
recreational impact, and their availability. The six evaluation criteria (discussed in Section 3.0)
are:
¤ What is the estimated reservoir yield from the proposed impoundment, and to what extent
would the reservoir satisfy the projected water needs of Jackson County?
¤ Are any threatened and endangered species present in the drainage area that would be
flooded by impoundment, or affected by the reduced downstream flow?
¤ Would the impoundment affect any stretch of river designated or proposed under Wild
and Scenic Rivers Act (1968) or rivers that are afforded some level of protection by a
State designation?
¤ What is the reservoir’s estimated impact or benefit to projected recreational needs?
