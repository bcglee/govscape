The above tables represent the analysis of capacity and yield for a proposed impoundment at the
War Fork and Steer Fork site. At pool elevation of approximately 1,060 feet above mean sea
level, there would be an impoundment of approximately 380 surface acres, and a volume of
22,000 acre feet and a capacity of 7.2 Billion gallons of water. During average drought
conditions, there would be a sustainable yield of 5.7 mgd and a yield of 3.6 mgd during worst
drought conditions. This is above the requirement of 3.0 mgd to be considered reasonable.
4.10.2 Threatened or Endangered Species
A survey completed by John MacGregor, T&E Specialist for the Daniel Boone National Forest,
identified a significant concentration of colonies and hibernaculua in close proximity to the
proposed reservoir site (USFS, 1996). Included are:
• Myotis sodalis (Indiana Bat) federally and KSNPC Endangered.
• Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus (Virginia Big Eared Bat) KSNPC Endangered.
• Corynorhinus rafinesquii (Rafinisque Big Eared Bat) KSNPC Threatened.
Further analysis must be performed in order to conclude whether or not these bat species would
be effected by the construction of the proposed reservoir.
