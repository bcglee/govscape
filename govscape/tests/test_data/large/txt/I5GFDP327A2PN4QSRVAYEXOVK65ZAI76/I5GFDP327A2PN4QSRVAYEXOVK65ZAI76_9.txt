¤ What is the availability of land for the impoundment and reservoir?
¤ What is the distance from the proposed impoundment to the Water Treatment Plant?
During this phase of alternative selection, the emphasis is to identify, as early as possible, the
suitability and possible environmental impacts of all potential alternatives. Any alternative that
is either unsuitable (e.g., because of cost or water quantity limitations) or would have serious
environmental impacts (e.g., would impact an endangered species or significant stretch of river)
can be eliminated from further analysis. In order to conduct the evaluation, the Mangi
Environmental Group, Inc. made use of available, related environmental studies (as described in
the Literature Review, Section 1.2) and undertook the following special studies:
Recreational Needs Analysis for the Proposed Jackson County Lake Project. February 1999.
The Mangi Environmental Group, Inc. This study compiled available recreational usage
statistics for lakes in the Jackson County area, estimates future recreational needs, and identifies
the proportion of future need that would be satisfied by a new lake.
Water Needs Analysis for Jackson County, Kentucky. February 1999. Commonwealth
Technology, Inc. This document quantifies Jackson County water needs from now until the year
2050. In addition, calculations were made by the Mangi Environmental Group, Inc. to determine
shoreline length (feet), reservoir surface area (acres), reservoir storage capacity (acre-feet), and
reservoir yield (mgd) for each alternative site.
Endangered Species Screening Study and Field Survey for the Cumberland Bean Pearly Mussel
(Villosa trabalis) for a Proposed Reservoir in Jackson County, Kentucky. February 1999. Eco-
Tech, Inc. Eco-Tech, Inc. performed a literature search identifying all previous studies
concerning rare species in Jackson County, Kentucky. Next field studies were performed at five
of the proposed reservoir locations. This document compiles all previous data pertaining to
Threatened and Endangered species in Jackson County, Kentucky and all data collected during
Eco-Tech, Inc. field studies.
