In the case of the Jackson County sites, where no streamflow data is available, a search of
streamflow records in that area of the state revealed that there was a station relatively nearby (at
Silver Creek near Kingston, KY, in neighboring Madison county). This streamflow gage existed
for sixteen years (from 1967 until 1983), and the drainage area at this site (28.6 square miles)
was about the size of the average drainage area for the potential reservoir sites in Jackson
County. Consequently the Silver Creek streamflow data were used to develop information on
the streamflow characteristics for the Jackson County sites.

respectively. Furthermore, it
was apparent from exa-
mination of the daily streamflows in these three dry years that most of the runoff occurred in the
first four months of the year (the percentage of the annual total runoff occurring in these four
months ranged from 51 percent in 1969 to 84 percent in 1980). Furthermore, the amount of
streamflow occurring in the five-month period when water demands are generally very high was
quite low, ranging from 1.6 inches in 1980 to 5.1 inches in 1969. These patterns of streamflow
quantity and seasonal variation were applied to the Jackson County sites using ratios of the
drainage areas of each of the thirteen Jackson County sites to the drainage area of the Silver
Creek gage to develop estimates of the worst dry year streamflow condition (lowest amount of
runoff in the four-month [January - April] spring reservoir refill period and lowest amount of
runoff in the five month [June - October] high water demand period) and an average‚Äù dry year
streamflow condition, which was defined as the average streamflow for those two periods in the
three driest years. The runoff and refill volumes for each of the Jackson County sites under each
low-flow condition were then computed using drainage area ratios. The refill was calculated by
subtracting the demand during the low-demand months from the in-flow during those months.
Although seasonal drawdowns will occur during average conditions, only the more extreme
drawdowns are shown, i.e. those for the worst drought. The drawdown was calculated based on
the volume of water that would be taken from the reservoir during high demand periods in excess
of the volume of in-flow during that period.
