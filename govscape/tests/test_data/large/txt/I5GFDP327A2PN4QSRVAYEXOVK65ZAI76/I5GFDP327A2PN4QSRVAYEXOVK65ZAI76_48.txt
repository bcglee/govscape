4.8.4 Recreation
Mill Creek at pool elevation would cover 96 acres. Using the calculations from Section 3.4 and
interpolating the estimated usage, the potential recreational usage of this site would be
approximately 74,000 visitor hours per year.
4.8.5 Availability
100% of the reservoir site would be located on National Forest Service lands (USGS, 1983c).
4.8.6 Distance to the Water Treatment Plant
The approximate distance from Site 8 to the Tyner Lake water treatment facility along roadways,
is approximately 7.5 miles.
4.8.7 Conclusion
The yield for this proposed site is below that required to be considered reasonable. For this
reason the recommendation is for this site to be excluded form further consideration.
