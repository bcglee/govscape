Number and Value of Livestock Lost to Vultures
Predation on newborn calves by vultures exceeded the
amount of predation on all other species and age classes,
and accounted for 82.4% of all livestock lost (Table 1).
Of the respondents that reported vulture predation to
cattle, the mean number of newborn calves reported lost
to vultures in the last year was 7.8 (±20.6), yearlings 0.21
(±0.14), and adults 0.8 (±0.18). Finally, total value of
cattle lost was $316,570 with a mean of $2,595
(±$5,728).
Coyote Damage
The level of coyote predation to livestock was also
solicited for response on this survey. Of the subset of
respondents that responded to Question 13 (“How many
animals do you lose annually to coyotes, and what is the
value of the animals lost to coyotes?”), the mean number
of newborn calves killed by coyotes was higher for those
who answered “yes” to Question 5 (“Do vultures attack
your livestock?”), than for those who answered “no” (t = -
3.712, P < 0.001) (Figure 5).
On ranches of 200 hectares or less, the mean number
of newborn calves killed by coyotes was also higher for
those who answered “yes” to Question 5, than those who
answered “no” (t = -3.01, P = 0.003). On ranches of 121
hectares or less, this pattern was the same, although it was
not significant at a 95% confidence level (t = -2.06, P =
0.051).

Deterrent Methods
Respondents reported a variety of control or deterrent
methods. Each deterrent method given was assigned to
one of the following groups: use of dogs, attractant
removal, shooting, traps, human presence, scarecrow/
effigy, or none. A mean effectiveness score was then
assigned to each method (Table 2). The use of dogs was
rated the most effective, followed by attractant removal
and shooting.
Opinion Questions
Responses to the nine opinion questions are
summarized in Figures 6 and 7. For the statements
“Vulture predation to livestock is a problem on my farm”
(Statement A), “Numbers of vultures in my area are
increasing” (Statement B), “Current methods for control-
