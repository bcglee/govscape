448 questionnaires were returned for a response rate of
15%, representing 60 of Florida’s 67 counties.
Landscape Level Analysis
We also looked at the survey data from a landscape
level perspective. Survey respondents who included their
address (discarding P.O. boxes) were entered into a
geodatabase. StreetMap USA address locator (ESRI
StreetMap extension for ArcMap 9.1) was used to
geocode the addresses to physical coordinates. We
focused on landfills, due to the likelihood for association
between vultures and landfills. All active class 1 and 2
landfills and transfer stations (Anonymous 1997) were
plotted on the same map. The distance from each ranch
to the nearest landfill or transfer station was then

Ranch Data
Of the 448 forms returned, 43 were omitted from the
analyses due to discrepancies or the fact that they
reported having no livestock. Thus, 405 were included in
700
the final analyses.
There was considerable variation in ranch size. The 600
mean ranch size was 370.7 (±1912.9) hectares (range:
1.01 - 34,398.28 hectares). The mean number of cattle 500
across all ranches was 215 (±1099.4). Mean cattle
400
density was 1.03 (±1.1) cows per hectare (range: 0.03-
12.36 cows per hectare). In addition, there were 9 300
ranches ≥1 sheep, 21 ranches with ≥1 pigs, and 35
ranches with poultry. A small number of ranches had 200
horses, goats, emus, rabbits, donkey, or water buffalo.

Question 5 on the survey asked ‘Do vultures attack
Yes (n=145) No (n=229)
your livestock?”. Two-hundred fifty-eight respondents
(63.7%) answered “no”, while 147 respondents (36.3%)
answered “yes”. The mean ranch size of those who
answered “no” was 97.9 hectares and was smaller than
the mean size of 850 hectares reported by those who
answered “yes” (t = -2.926, P = 0.004) (Figure 1). The
mean number of cattle followed a similar pattern with
those answering “no” to this question reporting fewer
cattle than those who answered “yes” (t = 3.109, P =
0.002) (Figure 2). However, there was no significant
difference in livestock density between the two groups (t
= -0.854, P = 0.394).
Respondents reported that most vulture attacks
occurred between November and March (Figure 3). A
majority of respondents reported attacks at midday,
followed by morning, and evening (Figure 4).
Several questions were designed to elicit responses
regarding the pattern of vulture attacks around birthing.
In response to the question asking if animals were
attacked while giving birth, 90% of respondents answered
“yes”. A majority of respondents (59%) also answered
“yes” when asked if first-time reproductive females were
more likely to be attacked than older females. Finally,
95% of respondents answered “yes” when asked if
newborns were attacked by vultures.
