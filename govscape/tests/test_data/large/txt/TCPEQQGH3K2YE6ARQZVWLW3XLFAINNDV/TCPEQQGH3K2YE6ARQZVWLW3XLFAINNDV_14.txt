1 Can sizes are industry terms and do not necessarily appear on the label.
2 The net weight on can or jar labels differs according to the density of the contents. For example: A No. 10 can of
sauerkraut weighs 6 lb 3 oz; a No. 10 can of cranberry sauce weighs 7 lb 5 oz. Meats, fish, and shellfish are known
and sold by weight of contents.
3 Number of cans to equal a No. 10 can are approximate measures. More exact measures can be made by using exact
volume or weight of contents.
