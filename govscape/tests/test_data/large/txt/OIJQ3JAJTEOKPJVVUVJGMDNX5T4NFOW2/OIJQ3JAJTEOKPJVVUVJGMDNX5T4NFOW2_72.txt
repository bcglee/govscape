Soil Properties and Features Management concerns and measures:
(cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are
Permeability: Moderately rapid
the slope and the large stones in the soil. Because of
Available water capacity: Low
the severity of the limitations, there would be
High water table: At a depth of more than 6 feet
considerable expense in designing and building
Drainage class: Well drained
structures or facilities that function properly.
Flood hazard: None

Typical Profile
Use and Management
Surface layer:
Cropland 0 to 6 inches—brown loam
Suitability: Unsuited Subsoil:
Management concerns and measures: 6 to 40 inches—brown and dark yellowish brown loam
(cid:127) Because areas of this soil are so steep, narrow, and
Substratum:
rocky, agricultural production of any type is virtually
40 to 60 inches—dark yellowish brown sandy loam
prohibited.

Permeability: Moderate
Suitability: Unsuited Available water capacity: High
Management concerns and measures: High water table: At a depth of more than 6 feet
(cid:127) Because of the low available water capacity, the high Drainage class: Well drained
content of rock fragments in and on the soil, and the Flood hazard: Rare for very brief duration from
equipment limitation on extremely steep slopes, the December to March
