52 Soil Survey
Interpretive Group Pasture and hay
Land capability classification: 7e Suitability for pasture: Poorly suited
Suitability for hay: Unsuited
Management concerns and measures:
DtF—Ditney sandy loam, 35 to 50 percent
(cid:127) Good pasture management is essential in controlling
slopes
erosion and maintaining productivity. It includes
applying lime and fertilizer according to soil test
Setting recommendations, weed control, and prevention of
overgrazing.
Landscape position: Side slopes of mountain ridges
Major uses: Woodland in most areas Woodland
Typical Profile Suitability: Moderately suited
Management concerns and measures:
Surface layer:
(cid:127) The slope creates an erosion hazard during
0 to 3 inches—dark grayish brown sandy loam
harvesting and reforestation and limits the safe
Subsurface layer: operation of equipment.
3 to 7 inches—yellowish brown loam (cid:127) Plant competition is a concern unless competing
vegetation is controlled.
Subsoil:
(cid:127) Trees suitable for planting include shortleaf pine and
7 to 18 inches—yellowish brown loam
eastern white pine.
18 to 24 inches—yellowish brown cobbly loam
Urban development
Substratum:
24 inches—hard sandstone Suitability: Poorly suited

Soil Properties and Features
(cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are
Permeability: Moderately rapid the slope and depth to bedrock. Because of the
Available water capacity: Low or moderate severity of the limitations, there would be considerable
High water table: At a depth of more than 6 feet expense in designing and building structures or
Drainage class: Well drained facilities that function properly.
Flood hazard: None
Interpretive Group
Reaction: Very strongly acid or strongly acid
Depth to bedrock: 20 to 40 inches Land capability classification: 7e
Inclusions
DtG—Ditney sandy loam, 50 to 80 percent
Contrasting inclusions:

high content of rock fragments and have bedrock
within a depth of 20 inches Setting
Similar inclusions: Landscape position: Side slopes of mountain ridges
