General Soil Map Units
The general soil map shows broad areas that have a Typical texture of surface layer: Sandy loam
distinctive pattern of soils, relief, and drainage. Each Slope: Steep to extremely steep
map unit on the general soil map is a unique natural
Unicoi
landscape. Typically, it consists of one or more major
soils or miscellaneous areas and some minor soils or Depth class: Shallow
miscellaneous areas. It is named for the major soils or Drainage class: Somewhat excessively drained
miscellaneous areas. The components of one map unit Landscape position: Backslopes and shoulders
can occur in another but in a different pattern. Parent material: Residuum
The general soil map can be used to compare the Typical texture of surface layer: Cobbly sandy loam
suitability of large areas for general land uses. Areas of Slope: Extremely steep
suitable soils can be identified on the map. Likewise,
Cataska
areas where the soils are not suitable can be identified.
Because of its small scale, the map is not suitable Depth class: Shallow
for planning the management of a farm or field or for Drainage class: Excessively drained
selecting a site for a road or building or other structure. Landscape position: Crests, shoulders, and side slopes
The soils in any one map unit differ from place to place Parent material: Residuum
in slope, depth, drainage, and other characteristics that Typical texture of surface layer: Channery silt loam
affect management. Slope: Very steep and extremely steep
