from January to March Management concerns and measures:
Drainage class: Moderately well drained (cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are
Flood hazard: None the wetness and the moderately slow permeability in
Reaction: Very strongly acid to slightly acid the subsoil. Because of the severity of the limitations,
Depth to bedrock: More than 60 inches there would be considerable expense in designing and
