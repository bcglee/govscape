Use and Management
mapped area
Cropland, pasture, and hay Typical Profile
Suitability: Unsuited Burton
Management concerns and measures:
Surface layer:
(cid:127) Because areas of this map unit are so steep, cold,
0 to 1 inch—partially decomposed forest litter
and droughty, agricultural production of any type is
1 to 14 inches—black loam
virtually prohibited.
Subsoil:
Woodland 14 to 24 inches—dark yellowish brown loam
Suitability: Poorly suited Substratum:
Management concerns and measures: 24 inches—hard gneiss bedrock
(cid:127) Because of the limited depth to bedrock, there is a
Wayah
windthrow hazard in established stands and a
susceptibility to seedling mortality due to an Surface layer:
inadequate moisture supply. 0 to 1 inch—mostly decomposed forest litter

16 to 23 inches—strong brown loam
(cid:127) Because trees at high, frigid, exposed elevations are
susceptible to severe wind and frost damage, Subsoil:
productivity is substantially limited. 23 to 32 inches—strong brown loam
32 to 49 inches—strong brown fine sandy loam
Urban development
Substratum:
Suitability: Poorly suited 49 to 55 inches—strong brown fine sandy loam
Management concerns and measures: 55 to 65 inches—multicolored saprolite that crushes to
(cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are fine sandy loam
the slope and depth to bedrock. Because of the 65 inches—multicolored, partly consolidated,
severity of the limitations, there would be considerable weathered bedrock
expense in designing and building structures or
facilities that function properly. Soil Properties and Features
