Use and Management Minor Soils
Land use: Most areas are in mixed woodland; many of (cid:127) Lonon soils that formed in very deep, loamy
the less sloping areas are cleared for crops, hay, colluvium; on fans and footslopes
or pasture (cid:127) Braxton soils that formed in very deep, clayey
Primary limiting features: Slope in most areas is the residuum; on small intervening limestone ridges
only significant limitation (cid:127) Pettyjon soils that formed in very deep alluvium that
has almost no rock fragments; on flood plains
