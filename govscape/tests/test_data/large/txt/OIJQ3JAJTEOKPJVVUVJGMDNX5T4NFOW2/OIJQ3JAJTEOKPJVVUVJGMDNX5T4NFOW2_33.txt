Use and Management
Surface layer:
Cropland, pasture, and hay 0 to 1 inch—partially decomposed forest litter
1 to 14 inches—black loam
Suitability: Unsuited
Management concerns and measures: Subsoil:
(cid:127) Because areas of this map unit are so cold and 14 to 24 inches—dark yellowish brown loam
droughty, agricultural production of any type is virtually
Substratum:
prohibited.
24 inches—hard gneiss bedrock
Woodland
Craggey
Suitability: Poorly suited
Surface layer:
Management concerns and measures:
0 to 13 inches—black loam
(cid:127) Because of the limited depth to bedrock, there is a
windthrow hazard in established stands and a Substratum:
susceptibility to seedling mortality due to an 13 inches—hard gneiss bedrock
inadequate moisture supply.
Soil Properties and Features
(cid:127) Because trees at high, frigid, exposed elevations are
susceptible to severe wind and frost damage, Permeability: Moderately rapid
productivity is substantially limited. Available water capacity: Burton—low or moderate;
Craggey—very low or low
Urban development
High water table: At a depth of more than 6 feet
Suitability: Poorly suited Drainage class: Burton—well drained; Craggey—
Management concerns and measures: somewhat excessively drained
(cid:127) The main limitation affecting most urban uses is the Flood hazard: None
depth to bedrock. Because of the severity of this Reaction: Extremely acid to moderately acid
limitation, there would be considerable expense in Depth to bedrock: Burton—20 to 40 inches; Craggey—

function properly.
