44 Soil Survey
Management concerns and measures: Subsoil:
(cid:127) The slope creates a severe erosion hazard during 8 to 23 inches—yellowish brown and brownish yellow
harvesting and reforestation and limits the safe loam
operation of equipment and the types of equipment that
Substratum:
may be used.
23 to 33 inches—brownish yellow loam
(cid:127) Susceptibility to windthrow is a concern due to the
33 inches—weathered granite
limited rooting depth.
(cid:127) Plant competition is a concern unless competing Ashe
vegetation is controlled.
Surface layer:
(cid:127) Trees suitable for planting include eastern white pine
0 to 2 inches—partially decomposed forest litter
and yellow-poplar.
2 to 8 inches—very dark grayish brown sandy loam
(cid:127) Fraser fir is an example of a Christmas tree species
suitable for planting. Subsoil:
8 to 15 inches—dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam
Urban development
15 to 32 inches—yellowish brown gravelly fine sandy
Suitability: Poorly suited loam
Management concerns and measures:
Substratum:
(cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are
32 inches—hard granite bedrock
the slope and depth to bedrock. Because of the
severity of the limitations, there would be considerable Soil Properties and Features
