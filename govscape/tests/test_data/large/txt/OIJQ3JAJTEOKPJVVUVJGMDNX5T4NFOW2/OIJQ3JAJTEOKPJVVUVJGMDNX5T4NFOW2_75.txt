Soil Properties and Features
(cid:127) The main limitation affecting most urban uses is the
Permeability: Moderately rapid slope. Because of the severity of this limitation, there
Available water capacity: Moderate would be considerable expense in designing and
High water table: At a depth of more than 6 feet building structures or facilities that function properly.
Drainage class: Well drained

Contrasting inclusions: percent slopes, stony
(cid:127) Areas of Cleveland soils that have bedrock at a
depth of less than 20 inches
Setting
Similar inclusions:
Landscape position: Side slopes of mountain ridges
(cid:127) Areas of soils that do not have a dark surface layer
Major uses: Woodland in most areas

Management concerns and measures:
Subsoil:
(cid:127) Because of a severe hazard of erosion and an
