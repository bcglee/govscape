This soil survey is a publication of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, a joint effort
of the United States Department of Agriculture and other Federal agencies, State
agencies including the agricultural experiment stations, and local agencies. The Natural
Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service) has
leadership for the Federal part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
Major fieldwork for this soil survey was completed in 1990. Soil names and
descriptions were approved in 2000. Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this
publication refer to the conditions in the survey area in 1991. This survey was made
cooperatively by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Tennessee
Agricultural Experiment Station, the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, the Carter
County Board of County Commissioners, and the United States Department of
Agriculture, Forest Service. The survey is part of the technical assistance furnished to
the Carter County Soil Conservation District. The Carter County Board of County
Commissioners and the Tennessee Department of Agriculture provided financial
assistance for the survey.
Soil maps in this survey may be copied without permission. Enlargement of these
maps, however, could cause misunderstanding of the detail of mapping. If enlarged,
maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a
larger scale.
