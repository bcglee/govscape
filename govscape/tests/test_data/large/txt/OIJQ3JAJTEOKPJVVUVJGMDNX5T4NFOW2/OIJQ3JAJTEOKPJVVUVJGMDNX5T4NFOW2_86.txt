Suitability: Poorly suited
Permeability: Moderate Management concerns and measures:
Available water capacity: Low (cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are
High water table: At a depth of more than 6 feet the slope and depth to bedrock. Because of the

Inclusions
Land capability classification: 7e
Contrasting inclusions:
(cid:127) Small areas of Plott soils that have bedrock at a
UcG—Unicoi-Rock outcrop complex, 50 to
depth of more than 60 inches
80 percent slopes
