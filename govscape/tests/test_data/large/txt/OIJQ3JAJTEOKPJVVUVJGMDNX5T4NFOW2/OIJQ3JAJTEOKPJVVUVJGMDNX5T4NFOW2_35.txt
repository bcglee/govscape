Contrasting inclusions: Major uses: Woodland consisting mostly of Fraser fir

Composition
of less than 20 inches
(cid:127) Small areas of organic soil ranging from less than 10 Burton soil: Averaging about 60 percent of map units,
to as much as 25 inches thick over bedrock but ranging between 55 and 65 percent of each

Similar inclusions:
Wayah soil: Averaging about 35 percent of map units,

40 and 60 inches Typical Profile
Use and Management Burton
Surface layer:
Cropland, pasture, and hay
0 to 1 inch—partially decomposed forest litter
Suitability: Unsuited 1 to 14 inches—black loam
Management concerns and measures:
Subsoil:
(cid:127) Because areas of this map unit are so steep, cold,
14 to 24 inches—dark yellowish brown loam
and droughty, agricultural production of any type is
virtually prohibited. Substratum:
24 inches—hard gneiss bedrock
Woodland
Wayah
Suitability: Poorly suited
Management concerns and measures: Surface layer:
(cid:127) Because of the depth to bedrock of the Burton soil, 0 to 1 inch—mostly decomposed forest litter
there is a windthrow hazard in established stands. 1 to 4 inches—very dark brown loam
(cid:127) Seedling mortality is a concern because of the cold, 4 to 16 inches—dark brown loam
droughty climate of the map unit.
Subsurface layer:
(cid:127) The slope creates an erosion hazard during
16 to 23 inches—strong brown loam
harvesting and reforestation and limits the operation of
equipment. Subsoil:
(cid:127) Because trees at high, frigid, exposed elevations are 23 to 32 inches—strong brown loam
susceptible to severe wind and frost damage, 32 to 49 inches—strong brown fine sandy loam
productivity is substantially limited.
Substratum:
Urban development 49 to 55 inches—strong brown fine sandy loam
55 to 65 inches—multicolored saprolite that crushes to
Suitability: Poorly suited
fine sandy loam
Management concerns and measures:
65 inches—multicolored, partly consolidated,
(cid:127) The main limitations affecting most urban uses are
weathered bedrock
the slope and the depth to bedrock of the Burton soil.
Because of the severity of the limitations, there would
