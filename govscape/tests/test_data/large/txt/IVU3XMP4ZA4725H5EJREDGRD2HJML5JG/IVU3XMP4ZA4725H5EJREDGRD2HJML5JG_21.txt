Conclusions
NHANES and SIPPprovide useful estimates of NSLPparticipant character-
istics. This analysis also provides a bridge across the two national surveys
that are used to study different aspects of the NSLP: from eligibility issues
studied with SIPPto nutrition impacts studied with NHANES. Both surveys
provide estimates that are similar to available FNS administrative data for
participation by payment type. The weighting of NHANES observations by
reported purchase frequency results in estimates that are closer to FNS
reports for distribution by payment type than observations weighted by only
the NHANES population projection factors. The data on purchase frequency
represent the advantage of NHANES for some purposes, while monthly
data and data on additional household composition and program participa-
tion variables represent the advantage of SIPP. SIPPestimates for fiscal
year 2001 were also close to FNS reports for distribution by payment type.
Two limitations of these data include: (1) the possibility that survey respon-
dents include receiving school foods that are not part of the USDAmeal
programs when they say that they participate, and (2) the lack of informa-
tion about whether the participating students are actually certified for free
or reduced-price lunches.
Both surveys suggest that free lunch recipients are evenly divided among
White, African-American, and Hispanic participants, while full-price meal
recipients are predominantly White, reflecting the higher average incomes
for the latter group. Although Whites had the smallest share receiving free
lunches, they were about as likely as other groups to receive reduced-price
meals. Both NHANES and SIPPshow that participation for all payment
categories is higher for children ages 8-13. This finding is related to
younger students being from households with lower income-to-poverty
ratios, but the finding that participation is higher for younger children has
also been found in studies to be linked to greater feelings of stigma and
independence among older students (Glantz et al., 1994).
Additional information from SIPPshows that two-thirds of participants
from female-headed households received free lunches, reflecting lower
incomes in this group. About 9 in 10 participants in households receiving
food stamps, 82 percent receiving TANF, and 97 percent receiving both
received free lunches. But almost two-thirds of households with students
receiving free lunches were not participating in either FSPor TANF. These
data suggest that access to the NSLPcould be expanded among participants
in FSPand TANF. And there appears to be room for expanding access to
FSPor TANF among the many NSLPfree-lunch beneficiaries who are
possibly eligible.
