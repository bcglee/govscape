Appendix: Comparing SIPP and
NHANES to FNS Administrative
Data and the 1992 SNDA I
Here we compare SIPPand NHANES results with FNS administrative data
as a validation step. We also compare NSLPparticipation rates from SNDA
I with 1991-94 NHANES data and 1992 SIPPdata because those years best
match when SNDAI data were collected (spring 1992).
Comparing SIPP and NHANES Estimates
With FNS Administrative Data
We test the estimates of the distribution by payment category against FNS
reports by checking whether the 95-percent confidence intervals around our
estimates contain the FNS reported breakdowns. If the confidence interval
does not contain the FNS statistic, the difference between the survey result
and the FNS report would be considered statistically significant—that is,
unlikely to be due to chance. Our confidence in the survey results would be
diminished if the confidence intervals did not contain the FNS statistics.
The SIPPdata are sufficiently detailed to test monthly data against FNS
annual data. The results show that estimated breakdowns from SIPP
traced FNS reports well on a month-by-month basis through 2001. For
every month, the estimate was within the 95-percent confidence interval
(app. table 1).
The NHANES estimates are tested for a 4-year average because analysis
guidelines for NHANES recommend taking the 1999-2002 samples as a
whole (app. table 2). NHANES estimates are produced two ways. The first
set of NHANES estimates are characteristics used in the report. They are
simply weighted by the projection factors supplied by NHANES. These
estimates are different from the FNS reports by a statistically significant
amount: The 95-percent confidence intervals do not contain the FNS
reports, except for the reduced-price meals.
The second set of estimates are the NHANES estimates weighted by
respondents’answers on how frequently they purchase the NSLPlunch—
1-5 times per week in order to better match FNS data (i.e., in addition to
using the person weights). Respondents who reported that they purchase
lunch every day are counted fully, while those who purchase four times per
week are weighted at 80 percent of their full NSLPprojection factor, and so
on, down to 20 percent of the projection factor for those who purchase once
per week. This weighting is intended to account for differences in purchase
frequency across payment categories and thus more closely approximate the
FNS data, which are based on actual lunches purchased. The weighted
breakdowns were not significantly different from the FNS statistics: The
confidence intervals for these estimates do contain the FNS reports.
