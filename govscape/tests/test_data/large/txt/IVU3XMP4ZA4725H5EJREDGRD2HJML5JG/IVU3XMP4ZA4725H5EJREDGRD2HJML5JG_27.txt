fiscal year 1992 estimates are from ERS analysis.The age of individual recipients was estimated
with an assumption that the youngest household members were more likely to participate.
Therefore, age group estimates are not available from SIPP 1992.CCD 1991-92 is from the
Common Core of Data for America's Public Schools, National Center for Education Statistics
(http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/bat/) for school year 1991-92.These data were not available for free or
