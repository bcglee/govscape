Comparing SIPP and NHANES
Estimates With SNDA I Data
Characteristics of NSLPand the School Breakfast Program (SBP) participants
were reported by Wemmerus et al. (1996) using data from the School Nutrition
Dietary Assessment I of 1992. We compare earlier rounds of NHANES and
SIPPwith results from SNDAI as an additional validation step. However,
school meal participation information was collected differently in the 1992
SIPPPanel and NHANES 1991-94 (also known as NHANES III, Phase 2), the
years most comparable to the 1992 SNDAI. The 1992 SIPPasked whether any
children in the household received school lunch and school breakfast in the last
month, whether the meal was free or reduced-price, and the total number of
children who received a meal. The main limitation is that the individual recip-
ients were not identified. NHANES 1991-94 asked how often per week chil-
dren received school lunch and school breakfast, but did not ask whether meals
were free or reduced price, and asked only about children ages 16 or younger.
Another important difference between the surveys is that neither NHANES
1991-94 nor SIPP1992 collected data on the certification status of students
while SNDAI did. If a student is “certified” to receive a free lunch, for
example, the school has evaluated his or her application and deemed the
student eligible for a free lunch. Also, the definition of participation in
SNDAI is more precise than that in SIPPand NHANES. Within each certi-
fication category, students were counted as participants or nonparticipants;
they were participants if they ate at least three of five foods required for
reimbursable lunches (because, under the “offer vs. serve” provision of
NSLPregulations, meals may be counted as reimbursable if the student
takes at least three of the five foods).
The other difference between the surveys is that SIPPand NHANES have
more than double the sample size of SNDAI. Though SNDAI was designed
explicitly to measure NSLPand SBPprogram participants and the other two
surveys were not, its sample is much smaller in comparison. In Wemmerus
et al., the total NSLPand SBPcertified-free meal sample is 873 and the
number of reduced-price certified students is 154. The distribution of partic-
ipant characteristics is drawn from even smaller samples and may not repre-
sent certain demographic characteristics if the sample was not stratified to
capture them. In contrast, 1 month in SIPP, March 1992, has a sample size
of 2,154 free and 483 reduced-price “participating” students (where partici-
pation is self-reported). NHANES 1991-94 has 2,774 free and 512 reduced-
price “participating” students (where, again, participation is self-reported).
Appendix table 3 gives participation rates by grade for students in NSLP-
participating schools from SNDAand NHANES 1991-94. The estimates
from NHANES are weighted by frequency of participation, as just
explained. Participation rates from NHANES 1991-94 are higher than
SNDAI results in every grade group. While weighting by frequency
appears to improve the match to FNS administrative data, students may be
over-reporting the number of times per week they get the school lunch. The
possible bias in NHANES 1991-94 of visiting the North in the summer
might contribute as well because the South has higher rates of certification
for free meals than the Northeast and Midwest do. (This possible bias was
corrected in later versions of the survey.)
