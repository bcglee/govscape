Estimates are not available from NHANES because NHANES does not ask
for details on payment type. But the comparison of SNDAI and FNS data is
not as close as we expected it to be.
We think that each of these data sources has its pros and cons. While
SNDAdata are probably best for many measures (such as age), SIPPand
NHANES appear to have other advantages (such as representing ethnicity
and income, and matching FNS statistics on payment type distribution).
