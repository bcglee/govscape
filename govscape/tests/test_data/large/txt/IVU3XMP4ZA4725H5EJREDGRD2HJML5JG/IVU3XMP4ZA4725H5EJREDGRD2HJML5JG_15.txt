to poverty of 51-100 percent. For households with incomes above 185 percent
of poverty, 7-8 in 10 participants (72.1 percent in SIPP, 79.9 percent in
NHANES) paid full price for lunches. Estimates from SIPPand NHANES
diverge somewhat for the share of higher income participants receiving free
lunches. But both show roughly one-half (55.3 percent in SIPP, 45.6 percent
in NHANES) of participants at 131-185 percent of poverty receiving free
lunches and about 1 in 10 (12.3 percent in NHANES) to 2 in 10 (17.9
percent in SIPP) above 185 percent of poverty receiving them.
Income eligibility for meal benefits is determined in SIPPby monthly income
and poverty averaged over the year and in NHANES by annual income and
poverty. SIPPcollects the most detailed income data of any national surveys,
while NHANES collects income more generally by category. This difference
