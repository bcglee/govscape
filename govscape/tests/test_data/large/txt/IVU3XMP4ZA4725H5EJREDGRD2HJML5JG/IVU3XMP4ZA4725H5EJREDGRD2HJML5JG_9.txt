Although program participation is known to be underreported in national
surveys, SIPPand NHANES data can provide an unbiased estimate of the
share of different kinds of school meal participants by group as long as
different kinds of respondents are not more or less likely to report their
participation on a survey. Apotential issue in both surveys is that survey
respondents may incorrectly assume that they are being asked about any
meal items purchased at school, including those not included in the official
NSLPlunch. To the extent that such interpretations were made, the statistics
for all NSLPparticipants and for the category of participants paying full
price would be biased. NHANES tries to avoid this bias by defining a
school lunch as “a complete lunch that costs the same every day” and then
asking how often the respondent usually eats a “complete school lunch.”
Misinterpretations are still possible, however.
