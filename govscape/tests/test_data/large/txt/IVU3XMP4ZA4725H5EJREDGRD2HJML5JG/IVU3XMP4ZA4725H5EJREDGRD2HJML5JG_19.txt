however, using annual data to estimate a householdâ€™s monthly income at
the time of application provides a rough match, and some children eligible
for reduced-price lunches may have received free lunches due to State and
local subsidies.
Table 9 shows the mean income-to-poverty ratios of all students and of
NSLPparticipants by ethnic group, age group, and household composition
from SIPP, which provides some context to the characteristics patterns that
we see in the other tables. When considering all NSLPparticipants, White
(non-Hispanic) student households had higher income-to-poverty ratios
(4.2) compared with Black (3.3), Hispanic (3.4), Native American (3.4), and
Asian (4.0). Married-couple households were better off than other types of
households (4.2), while female-headed households were the least well off
(3.1). Households with older students had consistently higher income-to-
poverty ratios than households with younger students did, although the
differences were not great. Households with students ages 16-18 had an
average income-to-poverty ratio of 4.0, while households with the youngest
students had an average income-to-poverty ratio of 3.7.
