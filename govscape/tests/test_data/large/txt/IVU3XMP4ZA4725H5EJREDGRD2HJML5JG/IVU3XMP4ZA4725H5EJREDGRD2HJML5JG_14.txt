Distribution of
Payment Types Within
Demographic Subgroups
Next, we look at the distribution of NSLPparticipants by type of benefit
received within different demographic subgroups (tables 5 and 6). Both
SIPPand NHANES provide information about ethnicity, age groups, and
income-to-poverty groups. SIPPalso provides information about household
composition and participation in FSPand TANF.
The results from SIPPsuggest that, among White NSLPparticipants,
25.5 percent received free lunches in 2001 and 9.9 percent received
reduced-price lunches. The rest, 64.6 percent, received paid lunches.
Among African-American NSLPparticipants, 65.8 percent received free
lunches, while 13.0 percent received reduced-price lunches. Hispanic and
Native American participants had the highest share receiving free lunches,
76.6 percent for Hispanics and 78.3 percent for Native Americans. For
reduced-price lunches, 8.1 percent of Hispanic participants and 6.3 percent
of Native Americans received them. Asian participants fell in the middle of
the other groups: 42.6 percent received free lunches, and 9.2 percent
received reduced-price lunches. All minority groups were more likely to
receive free lunches than were Whites, but Whites were about as likely as
others to receive reduced-price lunches.
NHANES shows a similar distribution of payment types by ethnicity as
SIPPdoes. For the combined years of 1999-2002, 69.6 percent of African-
American participants received free lunches and 10.7 percent received
reduced-price lunches. NHANES shows a slightly smaller share than SIPP
does of White participants receiving free lunches (24.9 percent) and
reduced-price lunches (7.0 percent). NHANES estimates for Hispanics
receiving free lunches is also lower (64.2 percent) but higher for those
receiving reduced-price lunches (12.8 percent). NHANES does not have
information on Asian or Native American participants as separate groups
but has a general group, “Other Ethnicity,” of whom 47.6 percent received
free lunches and 10.2 percent received reduced-price lunches.
Estimates of NSLPparticipation by age group also differ by survey, but like
ethnicity estimates, they show similar comparative rankings across charac-
teristics within each survey. Both NSLPand SIPPshow that younger partic-
ipants received the highest share of free lunches and that the share declines
with each older age group. SIPPestimates range from 49.6 percent for
students ages 5-7 to 38.1 percent for those ages 16-18, while NHANES esti-
mates range from 49.3 percent for students ages 5-7 to 32.7 percent for
those 16-18. SIPPshows a higher share of participants ages 11-13 (11.5
percent) and 14-15 (11.4 percent) receiving reduced-price lunches than
other age groups did. NHANES shows a higher share of participants
ages 8-10 (10.9 percent) receiving reduced-price lunches than other age
groups did.
Nearly 9 in 10 NSLPparticipants from poor households received free lunches
according to both surveys: 87-88 percent of participants in households with
income to poverty of 0-50 percent and 85-86 percent of those with income
