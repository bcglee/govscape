NSLP = National School Lunch Program;SIPP = Survey of Income and Program Participation.
1Measured according to the 2001 Federal fiscal year, which is from October 1, 2000, to September 30, 2001.
2Bold numbers indicate that Food and Nutrition Service estimates fall within the 95-percent confidence interval for the month and payment
type.The standard errors (SE) calculated here are based on the formula provided in 2/14/2005 Source and Accuracy Statement for 2001 SIPP
Panel, equation (7), which is the equation for calculating the “SE of Estimated Percentages.”The formula is as follows:
s(x,p) = sqrt[(b/x)*p*(1-p)]
where b is a parameter provided by Census, x is the total weighted population, and p is the percentage of the weighted population of interest in
the total weighted population (and 0 < p <100).

1Bold numbers indicate that Food and Nutrition Service estimates fall within the 95-percent confidence interval.The confidence intervals were
estimated using SAS “proc surveyfreq,”which corrects for stratified sample design.FNS averages were computed for this 4-year period from data
reported at http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/slsummar.htm.
