Introduction
In 2004, the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) served an average of
29 million lunches daily, at a Federal cost of $7.6 billion (USDA, Food and
Nutrition Service, 2005). Schools provide meals to any student who wishes
to participate and pay full price. Students can receive a reduced-price lunch
if their household income is less than or equal to 185 percent of the Federal
poverty level.1 Students qualify for a free lunch if their household income is 1We divide household income by
less than or equal to 130 percent of poverty or if their household receives the Federal poverty guideline, which is

is considered poor. Higher thresholds

Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) according to the
number of each type of meal served.
This report has two objectives: (1) to provide information on the demographic
characteristics of NSLPparticipants and (2) to assess the quality of alterna-
tive data sources on NSLPparticipation. Statistics on demographic charac-
teristics help assess how well the program is targeted for both efficiency and
program access. FNS administrative data include information on the number
of participants and how those numbers are distributed across the free,
reduced-price, and full-price meal categories. But the administrative data do
not include information about the economic and demographic characteristics
of school meal participants. FNS publishes such data when available from
their School Nutrition Dietary Assessments (from SNDAI in 1992 and the
forthcoming SNDAIII), but availability of these data is infrequent.
Two nationally representative surveys, the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), are examined here as alternative sources of data on
NSLPcharacteristics. These surveys are used by many analysts to estimate
NSLP-related issues, and they are used to answer different kinds of ques-
tions: SIPPis more typically used to look at eligibility issues, and
NHANES is used to look at health and nutrition outcomes. Ajoint compar-
ison of results in each survey to the other and to FNS data serves both
communities of users. The data from these surveys provide estimates statis-
tically similar in magnitude to administrative data from FNS on the distri-
bution of participants by payment type and thus can be reasonably assumed
to provide reliable estimates of NSLPdemographic characteristics. (See
appendix for statistical comparisons of estimates from SIPP, NHANES,
FNS, and SNDAI.)
SIPP, designed to measure national program participation, provides a rich
set of monthly data for the same households over 3-4 years, depending on
the survey panel. NHANES is another nationally representative survey that
contains information about participation in the school meals programs, as
well as data on nutrition and health outcomes (see box, “Data Sources”).
SIPPestimates discussed here are from Federal fiscal year 2001, and the
NHANES estimates are from the combined calendar years of 1999-2002.
Each survey has an advantage over the other: SIPPhas more detailed data
on different characteristics, while NHANES has data on how often in a
week a student purchased a school meal compared with SIPPdata on
whether the student purchased a meal in the last month.
