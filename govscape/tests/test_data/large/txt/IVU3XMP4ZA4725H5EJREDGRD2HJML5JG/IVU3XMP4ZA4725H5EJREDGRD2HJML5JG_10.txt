Participant Characteristics
From SIPP and NHANES
Table 1 shows the distribution of all students and NSLPparticipants by
demographic characteristics in SIPP. In fiscal year 2001,2 55.2 percent of 2For SIPPcalculations, we calculate

students, Whites and Asians were less likely to participate in the NSLP,
while minority groups were more likely to participate.
The youngest age group, 5- to 7-year-olds, made up 21.2 percent of all
NSLPparticipants; 8- to 10-year-olds made up 25.9 percent; 11- to 13-
year-olds, 24.3 percent; 14- to 15-year-olds, 13.9 percent; and 16- to 18-
year-olds, 14.7 percent. Children ages 8-13 were more highly represented
among NSLPparticipants than among all students, and children ages 16-18
were less represented.
According to SIPP, NSLPparticipants were likely to have lower income
relative to poverty than were all students: Almost one-half of NSLPpartici-
pants (48.3 percent) had income from 0 to 185 percent of poverty compared
with a little more than one-third of all students (36.3 percent).
Of all participants, 62 percent lived in married-couple households, while 7.1
percent lived in male-headed households and 30.9 percent in female-headed
households. Most NSLPparticipants (82.3 percent) did not participate in
either the Food Stamp Program (FSP) or TANF, while 11.2 percent partici-
pated in the FSPalone.
Table 2 shows the distribution of all students and NSLPparticipants by
demographic characteristics in NHANES. Although NHANES reports
how many times per week students participated in NSLP, we count all
participants equally, regardless of how often they participate (table 2). The
estimates without weighting for participation frequency are the most
comparable to SIPP, which reports for each month whether or not individual
children in the household participate. In the following comparisons to FNS
data and in the appendix, however, we weight students in NHANES by
participation frequency in order to obtain estimates more comparable to
FNS administrative data and SNDAI.
NHANES estimates for the share of participants in each ethnic group were
within 1 percentage point of SIPPestimates, except for estimates for Black
students, which were about 2 percentage points lower in NHANES than in
SIPP. Similarly, the share in each age group from the NHANES sample was
within 1 percentage point of the share in SIPP, except for students ages
16-18. The share of NSLPparticipants below the poverty line in NHANES
(26.2 percent) is similar to the corresponding share in SIPP(24.1 percent).
Data on household composition and food stamp and TANF participation
were not released in NHANES 1999-2002.
