Summary
In 2004, the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) served an average of
29 million lunches daily, at a Federal cost of $7.6 billion. Schools are reim-
bursed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition
Service (FNS) according to the number of each type of meal served.
Schools provide three payment alternatives:
• Schools provide full-price meals to any students who wish to participate
and pay full price.
• Schools provide reduced-price meals to students if their household income
is less than or equal to 185 percent of the Federal poverty level.
• Schools provide free meals to students if their household income is less
than or equal to 130 percent of poverty or if their household receives food
stamps or assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) program.
What Is the Issue?
FNS administrative data do not include information on the demographic
characteristics of school meal participants—information that could help
program administrators more effectively target the program.
This study examines the demographic characteristics of students who
are served by the NSLP. And it looks at whether nationally representative
surveys that include NSLPdata can adequately estimate participant
characteristics.
The most recent FNS estimates of student characteristics were based on
the School Nutrition and Dietary Assessment I (SNDAI) conducted in
1992. This study uses two more recent national surveys—the 2001 Panel of
the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the 1999-2002
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)—to present
new estimates of NSLPparticipant characteristics.
What Did the Study Find?
We examined student participants’ethnicity, household composition, age
groups, income-to-poverty groups, and household participation in other
assistance programs.
• Both SIPPand NHANES suggest that free-lunch recipients are about evenly
divided among White, African-American, and Hispanic participants.
Within ethnic groups, Whites had the smallest share of students receiving
free lunches, but they were just as likely as other groups to receive
reduced-price meals.
• SIPPshows that two-thirds of participants from female-headed households
received free lunches.
• Both NHANES and SIPPshow that participation within each lunch payment
category (free, reduced-price, and paid) was higher for children ages 8-13.
