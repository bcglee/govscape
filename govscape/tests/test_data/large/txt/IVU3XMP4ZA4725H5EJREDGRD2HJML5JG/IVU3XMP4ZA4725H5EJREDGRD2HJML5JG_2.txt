Data From Two National Surveys

Abstract
The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) serves more than 29 million
children each day, but there is little information on the characteristics of
those children. This study reports new estimates of NSLPparticipant
characteristics using two national surveys: the 2001 Panel of the Survey
of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the 1999-2002 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Study results also
show that these two surveys are suitable sources of data on NSLPpartici-
pants since they are consistent with more aggregated administrative data
of the Food and Nutrition Service. The surveys supplement periodic
characteristics data available from the School Nutrition and Dietary
Assessment (SNDA) surveys.
