When we compare SIPP1992 with SNDAI, we find that the results are
generally very different (app. table 4). We can compare ethnic groups and
income-to-poverty groups, if we assume that those are constant across the
household. In order to keep the measures at the individual level, we
assume that the youngest members of the household are the ones receiving
the meal benefits. The results show that, compared with SIPP, SNDAI has
a higher share of Whites among all students and a lower share of minorities,
especially Hispanics. Comparing both SIPPand SNDAI with ethnicity
data from the Common Core Data (CCD) of Americaâ€™s Public Schools from
the National Center for Education Statistics, the SIPPestimates are closer
than the SNDAI estimates. We cannot compare SIPP1992 with SNDAI
for age groups because we do not have information on individuals in
SIPP1992. However, SNDAI age group statistics are similar to those
from the CCD.
Income-to-poverty statistics are also very different for several reasons. First,
methods of measuring income differ, and Wemmerus et al. note that the
income is generally under-reported in SNDAI. In contrast, SIPPis generally
considered the best income data available because of its comprehensiveness.
Second, SNDAI data measure certified students, and certified students are
more likely to have been accurately screened for eligibility, unlike SIPP
students. Third, SIPPincome and poverty data are monthly, and the esti-
mates are average income-to-poverty ratios across all 1992 fiscal year
months. This difference in measurement might explain some of the differ-
ence in results because SNDAI data are presumably from annual income-
to-poverty data.
Given the large differences between both SIPPand NHANES and SNDA,
we wondered to what extent the SNDAI estimates approximate FNS
administrative data reports. FNS
