Participation by Payment Type:
Compared Across SIPP,
NHANES, and FNS Data
We compare estimates from the SIPPand NHANES with FNS statistics on
average participation levels by benefit type and find that both surveys
provide estimates close to FNS participation data by payment type. The
FNS data are taken as the most reliable benchmark because they are derived
directly from administrative data on lunches served and not subject to statis-
tical sampling variability. Percentages are calculated from the FNS data on
average daily meals served, which they adjust for student attendance. Table
3 shows average participation for each year from fiscal years 1999 to 2003
by meal type: full price (or “paid”), reduced price, or free. Almost one-half
of all NSLPlunches were free (46.9-48.2 percent), and 8.9-9.5 percent were
available at a reduced price, depending on the year. The remaining lunches
were full price.
SIPPand NHANES participation estimates by payment type are both close
to the FNS data (table 4). The SIPPestimate for free lunch participation
(45.3 percent) differs from the FNS statistic for 2001 (46.9 percent) by
about 2 percentage points, while the NHANES estimate for free lunch
participation (46.4 percent) differs from the 1999-2002 FNS estimates by at
most 2 percentage points. For reduced-price lunches, the NHANES esti-
mate (9.2 percent) is the same as the FNS statistic for 2000 and not more
than 1 percentage point different from the other years. The SIPPestimate
for reduced-price lunches (10.0 percent) is less than 1 percentage point
different from the FNS data for 2001 (9.5 percent). Statistical tests for the
significance of these differences are presented in the appendix.
