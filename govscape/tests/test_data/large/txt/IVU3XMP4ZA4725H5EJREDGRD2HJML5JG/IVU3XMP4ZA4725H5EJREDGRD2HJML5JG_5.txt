• Almost one-half of NSLPparticipants lived in households with incomes
of 0-185 percent of poverty compared with a little more than one-third of
all students, according to SIPP.
• According to SIPP, almost all students in households participating in the
Food Stamp Program (FSP) or TANF received free lunches. But almost
two-thirds of households with students receiving a free lunch were not
participating in either the FSPor TANF.
Estimates from NHANES and SIPPare generally similar to each other.
Both provide estimates that are statistically close to FNS administrative
data for overall participation in free, reduced-price, and full-price lunches.
Therefore, we find that these two national surveys are useful sources of
data for examining participant characteristics and NSLPeffectiveness.
How Was the Study Conducted?
We estimated NSLPparticipant characteristics from SIPPusing Federal
fiscal year 2001 and NHANES using calendar years 1999-2002. We tested
whether the FNS administrative data were within the 95-percent confidence
intervals of estimates from each of the two surveys. We compared the
results of the two surveys with each other. We also compared estimates from
earlier rounds of SIPPand NHANES with estimates from the 1992 SNDAI.
