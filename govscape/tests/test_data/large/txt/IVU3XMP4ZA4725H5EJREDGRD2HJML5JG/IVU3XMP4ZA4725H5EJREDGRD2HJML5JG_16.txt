may explain some of the mismatch between the eligibility categories and the
types of meals received, but errors in matching students to the right benefits
are known to be present. Further, students eligible for reduced-price lunches
(131-185 percent of poverty) may be subsidized by State and local govern-
ments in order to receive free lunches.
Female-headed households were the most likely among household types to
have participants receiving free lunches according to SIPP. More than two-
thirds (69.1 percent) of participants from female-headed households, almost
one-third (33.0 percent) from married-couple households, and one-half (48.5
percent) from male-headed households received free lunches. For reduced-
price lunches, 10.8 percent of participants from female- and 11.0 percent
from male-headed households received reduced-price lunches, while 9.5
percent of participants from married-couple households received them.
SIPPshows that FSPor TANF participants were more likely to receive free
lunches than any other type of lunch. Among the FSP-only participants,
92.6 percent received free lunches while 3.3 percent received reduced-price
lunches. Among participants in both FSPand TANF, 97.2 percent received
free lunches and 1.0 percent received reduced-price lunches. Among
TANF-only participants, however, the rate for receiving free lunches was
lower, 81.6 percent. As much as 100 percent of FSPor TANF participants
could have received free lunches because participation in those programs
automatically certifies the household as eligible in the NSLP.
