Distribution of
Demographic Subgroups
Within Payment Types
Both SIPPand NHANES suggest that free lunch recipients in 2001 were
roughly divided equally by the three major ethnic groups: Whites (31.1
percent in SIPP, 32.6 percent in NHANES), African-Americans (27.7
percent in SIPP, 27.9 percent in NHANES), and Hispanics (34.6 percent
in SIPP, 32.0 percent in NHANES) (tables 7 and 8). In SIPP, Native
Americans were 3.5 percent of free lunch receipients and Asians were 3.1
percent, and in NHANES, the comparable “Other Ethnicity” category were
7.5 percent. Among reduced-price lunch recipients in SIPP, 54.5 percent
were White, 24.7 percent were African-American, and 16.5 percent were
Hispanic. The share of Whites among reduced-price recipients is almost the
same as the share (55.2 percent) among all NSLPparticipants (table 1).
NHANES shows a lower share of White reduced-price lunch recipients
(42.8 percent) and African-American (19.9 percent) but a higher share of
Hispanic (29.7 percent).
The distribution by age in SIPPof free lunch recipients is similar to the
age breakdown for overall participation: 23.2 percent were ages 5-7; 27.8
percent, ages 8-10; 23.8 percent, ages 11-13; 12.8 percent, ages 14-15; and
12.4 percent, ages 16-18. Results from NHANES are mostly within 1-2
percentage points of the SIPPestimates. According to SIPP, older children
are slightly more highly represented among reduced-price recipients than
among free lunch recipients: 18.2 percent were ages 5-7; 25.2 percent, ages
8-10; 27.8 percent, ages 11-13; 15.9 percent, ages 14-15; and 13.0 percent,
ages 16-18. NHANES estimates are more concentrated toward younger
children, with 21.3 percent of reduced-price recipients ages 5-7 and 32.3
percent ages 8-10.
SIPPshows that students receiving free lunches were less likely to be from
a married-couple household (45.2 percent) and more likely to be from a
female-headed household (47.1 percent) than were students in other
NSLPcategories. Among reduced-price recipients, 58.8 percent were from
married-couple households, 7.7 percent were from male-headed households,
and 33.3 percent were from female-headed households.
According to SIPP, 63.4 percent of free lunch recipients did not participate
in either FSPor TANF, while 22.8 percent participated in FSPand 11.9
percent participated in both FSPand TANF. Both programs have restric-
tions that may keep households out of either program, but that only 34.7
percent participated in FSPis somewhat surprising. Almost all of the paid
(98.5 percent) and reduced-price (95.1 percent) recipients participated in
neither program, as would be expected.
SIPPshows that 38.8 percent of participants receiving free lunches had
income-to-poverty ratios above 130 percent—the eligibility threshold for a
free lunch. NHANES estimates show 27.3 percent of free lunch recipients
above 130 of poverty. Similarly, many reduced-price lunch recipients
(51.7 percent in SIPP, 39.5 percent in NHANES) had income-to-poverty
ratios out of the range of eligibility for reduced-price lunches. Again,
