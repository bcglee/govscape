USING Part III-RESOURCES WITH PART II
Resources follows Part II of the guide and contains information which may be used
either independently or in conjunction with the guide. A brief summary of each section
of Resources is outlined below.
• The Soil Quality Checklist lists a brief summary of all nine steps and a space to check
off when each step is completed. This can be used in the field and the office. It is to
be used as a guide or roadmap for assessing and improving soil quality.
• The Soil Quality Assessment Field Record lists all nine steps of soil quality
assessment and provides space to record information collected from the producer,
measurement data, and guidance on the information recorded.
• The Flow Chart for Selecting Indicators provides a framework for selecting
indicators for a minimum data set.
• Suggested Management Solutions to Soil Quality Problems can be used either with, or
independently of, the guide. This table begins with an indicator or concern, proceeds
to possible reasons for the problem, continues with suggested changes in management
to improve soil quality, and concludes with respective conservation practices listed in
the Field Office Technical Guide.
• Comparison of Soil Quality Assessment Methods briefly summarizes the pros and
cons of different methods for assessing soil quality. Users who are familiar with the
various methods may want to skim over Step 3 and glance at this chart before
selecting methods.
• The NRCS Soil Health Card Template (NRCS Template) is a generic template for
creating a locally adapted Health Card for qualitative assessments. More information
about the NRCS Template is given in Step 3. The NRCS Template can be used as is
or as a template to develop a card that is specific to a state or region.
