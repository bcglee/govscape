Figure 1. Soil quality framework outlining the process for selecting indicators for an MDS to
assess soil quality.
The farmer(cid:146)s goals for soil quality are established, and soil functions supporting those
goals are identified. Soil functions are what the soil does or the services it provides. For each
soil function, measurable soil properties that influence the capacity of the soil to perform that
function are defined. The attribute or property reflects the measured change in the function. One
or more attributes or properties can describe the change in a specific soil function. The attribute
or property can be difficult to measure directly, so an indicator can be used to serve as an indirect
and practical measure. The choice of the indicator would be based on the available
methodology, including ease of measurement and accuracy needed. The methodology could be
either qualitative or quantitative, depending on what is needed to fulfill the soil quality goals of
the farmer. The minimum data set (MDS) is the minimum number of indicators that will provide
a practical assessment of the soil functions identified.
For example, a goal of the farmer may be to improve infiltration of rainfall. A soil
function relating to this goal would be partitioning rainfall at the soil surface. A soil property
that can measure change in this soil function would be infiltration. An indicator of this property
could be infiltration rate. A methodology for this indicator could be the single ring method used
in the Soil Quality Test Kit. This is a quantitative method. An alternative methodology could be
observations of ponding or runoff during a rainfall. This would be a qualitative method.
