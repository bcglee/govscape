Table 1. Example of a Minimum Data Set of Indicators for Soil Quality
Indicator Relationship to Soil Health
Soil organic matter (SOM) Soil fertility, structure, stability, nutrient retention, soil
erosion, and available water capacity
PHYSICAL
Soil structure Retention and transport of water and nutrients, habitat for
microbes, and soil erosion
Depth of soil and rooting Estimate of crop productivity potential, compaction, and
plow pan
Infiltration and bulk density Water movement, porosity, and workability
Water holding capacity Water storage and availability
CHEMICAL
pH Biological and nutrient availability
Electrical conductivity Plant growth, microbial activity, and salt tolerance
Extractable nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), Plant available nutrients and potential for N and P loss
and potassium (K)
BIOLOGICAL
Microbial biomass carbon (C) and N Microbial catalytic potential and repository for C and N
Potentially mineralizable N Soil productivity and N supplying potential
Soil respiration Microbial activity measure
