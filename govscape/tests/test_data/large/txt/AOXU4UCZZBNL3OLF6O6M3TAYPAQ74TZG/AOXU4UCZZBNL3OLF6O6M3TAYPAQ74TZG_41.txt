NOTES:
1) Take all measurements under adequate moisture conditions (e.g., not excessively dry or wet).
2) Certain measurements, such as soil life, earthworms, structure, and tillage are affected greatly by field operations. They should be assessed before
major tillage operations.
3) Select the best time for assessment and take measurements at the same time every year. See Maryland Card for an example of assessment time or
calendar.
4) Include only regionally relevant indicators and descriptive terms.
5) This list is not all-inclusive. Add indicators as necessary, and leave blank spaces for field determined indicators.
