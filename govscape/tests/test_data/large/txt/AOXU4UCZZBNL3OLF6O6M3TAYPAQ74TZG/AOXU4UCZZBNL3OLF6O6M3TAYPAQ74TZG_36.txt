Problem:
Organic matter/ Excess tillage Diversify or increase crop rotations Residue management (329A, B, C,
residue Residue burned off Add animal manure and D)
Low residue crops Use cover crops Conservation crop rotation (328)
Indicators to test: Too much fallow Use high residue crops Cover and green manure crop (340)
Organic carbon Insufficient additions of crop residue Reduce tillage
Percent residues
Use of ammonium fertilizers Soil test - correct pH levels Nutrient management (590)
Problem No liming Add lime for low pH
Soil pH Poor drainage Improve drainage
Problem/Indicators Possible Reason for Low Ranking Suggestions to Improve Soil Quality Possible NRCS FOTG Practices*
Irrigation water management (449)
Problem: Seeps For sodium problem, apply gypsum and Conservation crop rotation (328)
Sodium Shallow water table leach with irrigation water Soil salinity management-
Low calcium irrigation water Manage irrigation water nonirrigated (571)
Indicators to test: Poor drainage Improve irrigation water quality Subsurface drain (606)
Soil structure Improve drainage Surface drainage-field ditch (607)
Soil pH Surface drain-main or lateral (608)
SAR Nutrient management (590)
Problem: Low residues Increase organic residues Residue management (329A, B, C,
Tilth/soil stability Low organic matter Use cover crops and D)
Excess tillage Add animal manure Conservation crop rotation (328)
Indicators to test: Fallow Reduce number of tillage passes Cover and green manure crop (340)
Aggregate stability Compaction Avoid tillage when wet
Slake test
Structure index
Problem: Nutrient imbalances (deficiencies or Soil test - correct nutrient and pH levels Nutrient management (590)
Soil fertility excesses) Increase organic residue Residue management (329A, B, C,
Poor drainage Use animal manure and D)
Indicators to test: Poor or limited soil microbial activity Use cover crops & crop rotations Conservation crop rotation (328)
Organic carbon Incorrect pH Reduce tillage Cover and green manure crop (340)
