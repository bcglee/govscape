Suggested Management Solutions to Soil Quality Problems
Instructions: Use this table to determine possible causes of the soil quality problem, possible indicators to test for the problem,
and potential management solutions. This is not a comprehensive list.
Problem/Indicators Possible Reason for Low Ranking Suggestions to Improve Soil Quality Possible NRCS FOTG Practices*
Avoid working wet soil
Problem: Working wet soil Reduce traffic/tillage operations Residue management, no-till and
Compaction Excess traffic Use controlled traffic patterns strip till (329 A)
Heavy machinery Avoid using heavy machinery Residue management, mulch till
Indicators to test: Repeated tillage at same depth Subsoil or rip when soil is not excessively (329 B)
Bulk density Excess animal traffic wet or dry Residue management, ridge till
Penetration Poor aggregation Alter tillage depth (329 C)
resistance Low organic matter Add organic residues Residue management, seasonal
Porosity Diversify cropping system (329 D)
Root growth patterns Use conservation tillage Chiseling and subsoiling (324)
Add cover crops Conservation crop rotation (328)
Use crop rotations Cover and green manure crop (340)
Add animal manures
Use non-compacting tillage (e.g., chisel vs
moldboard)
Soil test - correct nutrient and pH levels
Problem: Compacted layers Check for pathogens/pests Nutrient management (590)
Crop disease Saturated soil Reduce compaction following harvest Pest management (595)
Soil pathogen problems Improve drainage Conservation crop rotation (328)
Indicators to test: Nutrient deficiencies or unbalance Increase organic residue
Plant health Low organic matter Use animal manure
Crop vigor Monoculture Add cover crops
Yield Low biological diversity Use crop rotation
Diversify cropping system
Problem:
Crusting Excess sodium Increase organic residues Residue management (329A, B, C,
Low organic matter Reduce tillage depth and D)
Indicators to test: Low residues Use animal manure Conservation crop rotation (328)
Aggregate stability Add cover crops Cover and green manure crop (340)
Slake test For sodium problem - apply gypsum and
Observations flush with irrigation water
