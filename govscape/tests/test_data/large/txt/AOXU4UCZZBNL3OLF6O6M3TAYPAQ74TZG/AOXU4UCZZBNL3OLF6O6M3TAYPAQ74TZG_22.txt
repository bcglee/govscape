BASELINE AND TARGET VALUES .
A basic goal of a soil quality assessment
is to provide information about the trend
of soil quality (increasing, decreasing, or
maintaining).
Results obtained from the first soil
quality assessment provide the baseline
from which to evaluate future changes.
Subsequent measurements provide
information about the trend or direction
of soil properties. The goal is indicators
moving in the desired direction or
becoming relatively stable at an
acceptable level.
Achieving a target level may be desired.
