Problem: Tillage pan Subsoil to break up tillage pan Chiseling and subsoiling (324)
Drainage High water table Add drainage system Subsurface drain (606)
Poor soil structure Surface drainage-field ditch (607)
Indicators to test: Surface drainage-main or lateral

Problem/Indicators Possible Reason for Low Ranking Suggestions to Improve Soil Quality Possible NRCS FOTG Practices*
Problem:
Soil life Low organic matter Increase organic residues Residue management (329A, B, C,
Low residues Use conservation tillage and D)
Indicators to test: Excess pesticides or fertilizers Use crop rotations Conservation crop rotation (328)
Earthworms Excess tillage Add cover crops Cover and green manure crop (340)
Soil respiration Poor aeration
Microbial biomass
Pitfall trapping
Irrigation water management (449)
Problem: Saline seeps Leach excess salts Conservation crop rotation (328)
Salinity Saline irrigation water/well Plant deep rooted crops Soil salinity management-
Shallow water table Grow salt tolerant crops nonirrigated (571)
Indicators to test: Poor drainage Increase vegetative cover Subsurface drain (606)
Electrical conductivity Excess evaporation Manage irrigation water Surface drainage-field ditch (607)
Observe white crust Improve drainage Surface drain-main or lateral (608)
Residue management (329A, B, C,
Problem: Lack of cover and residue Diversify crop rotations and D)
Erosion Low organic matter Reduce tillage Conservation crop rotation (328)
Poor aggregation Use animal manure Cover and green manure crop (340)
Indicators to test: Tillage pan or compacted layer Use cover crops Contour farming (330)
Observe rills, gullies Tillage practices that move soil Increase surface residue or roughness Strip-cropping, contour (585)
Topsoil depth down slope Shorten slope length Terrace (600)
Aggregate stability Excessive tillage Plant strip crops Grassed waterway (412)
Intensive crop rotation Use wind breaks Contoured buffer strips (332)
Add organic residue Chiseling and subsoiling (324)
Problem: Compaction Add animal manure Residue management (329A, B, C,
Infiltration Surface crusting Use cover crops and D)
Plow pan Diversify crop rotation Conservation crop rotation (328)
Indicators to test: Poor soil structure/aggregation For sodium problem, apply gypsum and Cover and green manure crop (340)
Infiltration rate Excess sodium flush with irrigation water Contour farming (330)
Aggregate stability Subsoil or rip when soil is not excessively Strip-cropping, contour (585)
Soil structure wet or dry Terrace (600)
Use tillage that preserves soil structure Irrigation water management (449)
