(NOTE: The Soil Quality Assessment Field Record does not contain space for recording
data or observations about particular soil quality indicators. This information should be
recorded on either the Soil Quality Health Card, the NRCS Soil Health Card Template,
or the data worksheet included in the Soil Quality Test Kit Guide. For example, if
indicators are being measured using tools in the Soil Quality Test Kit, data notes should
be kept on the Soil Quality Data Worksheets included with the Kit).
