A NOTE ON THE NRCS PLANNING PROCESS
This guide complements existing NRCS planning documents, including the Quality Criteria in the
Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG, Section III), Resource Management Systems (RMS)
discussed in the FOTG and National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH), and the Conservation
Practices Physical Effects (CPPE) document (FOTG, Section V). It is designed to provide
information for a planner to use in assessing and improving soil quality in the planning process.
Because the term, (cid:147) soil quality,(cid:148) is relatively new, this guide was developed to help conservation
professionals better understand how to fit soil quality into planning. It does not lessen the
importance of the other natural resources recognized in the planning process (water, animals, plants,
and air). This guide provides a road map for the planner and is not meant to replace the FOTG and
Planning Handbook. All of the nine steps do not have to be followed to complete a successful soil
quality evaluation.
Although this guide deals specifically with soil quality assessment and enhancement, it can be tied
to the whole planning process, because soil resources affect water, animals, plants, and air.
HOW TO USE THE GUIDE
AS A PLANNING GUIDE: Follow the nine steps of planning in Part II. Follow the steps
sequentially when possible. Use the Soil Quality Assessment Field Record in Resources to record
information for the conservation plan.
FOR INFORMAL ASSESSMENTS: Select only the relevant parts. Use the Soil Quality Assessment
Field Record to record only the information needed. All nine steps of planning do not need to be
followed, nor must the steps be followed in sequence.
FOR QUICK ASSESSMENTS: Use the charts in Resources to find information for selecting
indicators and management solutions.
