Resources and enemy release may interact to cause invasion.(Left) Species adapted
to high resource availability are inhibited by enemies in their native range,and therefore
have great potential to benefit from escaping those enemies in their exotic range.
(Right) Although all high-resource species will benefit from high resource availability,
high-resource exotic species will also benefit from enemy release.Therefore,increasing
resource availability will increase the advantage of exotic over native species.
