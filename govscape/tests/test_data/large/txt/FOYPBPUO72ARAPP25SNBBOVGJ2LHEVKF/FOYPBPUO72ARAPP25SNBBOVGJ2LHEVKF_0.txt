ABSTRACT ter than the summer in the upper 0.3 m of soil. The results of this
study shows that alfalfa fine roots more thoroughly exploit the soil
Root development in alfalfa (Medicago satire L.) is dependent of
volume in the absence of wheel traffic and that compaction from
many factors including the soil environment which is influenced by
traffic diminished root growth to different depths depending on its
crop management procedures. Soil compaction, which is unavoidable

under current management procedures, can have a detrimental effect
on root development. The purpose of this field experiment was to
compare the effects of controlled and conventional traffic manage-
ment on alfalfa fine root growth in a Wasco sandy loam (coarse-
