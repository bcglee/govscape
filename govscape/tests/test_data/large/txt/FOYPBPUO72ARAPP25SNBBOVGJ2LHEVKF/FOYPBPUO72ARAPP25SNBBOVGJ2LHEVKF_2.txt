The absence of any difference in FRD during 1983
and the winter of 1984 represents no effect on root
density from harvest traffic even though it had been
implemented four to five times. Twenty months
elapsed from the time of planting until there was a
significant decrease in fine-root growth due to harvest
traffic. Prominent peaks in the surface-0.45-m depths
during the winters of 1984 to 1985 and 1985 to 1986
represent the maximum difference between these
treatments. The third peak, August 1986, is due to the
dramatic decline in root density in the GR-H lane
after four seasons of extreme traffic as seen in Fig. 2B.
The difference plot between NN and RE (graphic
representation not shown), shows statistical similarity
in root density from the 0.6 to 1.8-m depth throughout
the experiment. The significantly greater FRD in NN
(Fig. 1) was seen between the surface — 0.45-m layers.
This difference was not observed until October 1984.
