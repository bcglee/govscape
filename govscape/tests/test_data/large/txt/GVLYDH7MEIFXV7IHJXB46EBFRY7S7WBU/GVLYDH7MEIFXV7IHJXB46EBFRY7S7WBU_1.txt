his writings of the 1920s, none was more Washington, D.C.4
influential than a 1928 USDA bulletin
coauthored with William Ridgely Chapline
titled Soil Erosion: A National Menace.
Bennett expressed the motivation for his
later actions: “The writer, after 24 years
spent in studying the soils of the United
States, is of the opinion that soil erosion is
the biggest problem confronting the
farmers of the Nation over a tremendous
part of its agricultural lands.” The bulletin
was not a manual on the methods of
preventing soil erosion; rather it was
intended to draw attention “to the evils of
this process of land wastage and to the
need for increased practical information and
research work relating to the problem.”3
Bennett followed up momentum gained
from the bulletin and well-placed magazine
articles with a campaign for a national soil
erosion program. He knew the few soil
erosion researchers at the state agricultural
experiment stations. Important as their
investigations were, the experiments
covered only a few spots on the vast
agricultural landscape. In Bennett’s mind a
national program of soil erosion was
needed. Bennett’s ally in cause, A. B.
Connor of the Texas Agricultural
Experiment Station, enlisted the aid of
