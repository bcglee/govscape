been in place, through the zone or compartment, for at least the past 2 years without detection
of IHHNV.
OR
4. A zone previously declared free from IHHN but in which the disease is detected may not be
declared free from IHHN again until the following conditions have been met:
a) on detection of the disease, the affected area was declared an infected zone and a buffer zone was
established; and
b) infected populations have been destroyed or removed from the infected zone by means that
minimise the risk of further spread of the disease, and the appropriate disinfection procedures
(see Aquatic Manual) have been completed; and
c) targeted surveillance, as described in Chapters 1.1.4. and X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, has
been in place for at least the past 2 years without detection of IHHNV.
Article 4.1.6.6.
Maintenance of free status
A country, zone or compartment that is declared free from IHHN following the provisions of points 1
or 2 of Articles 4.1.6.4. or 4.1.6.5. (as relevant) may maintain its status as IHHN free provided that
basic biosecurity conditions are continuously maintained.
A country, zone or compartment that is declared free from IHHN following the provisions of point 3 of
Articles 4.1.6.4. or 4.1.6.5. (as relevant) may discontinue targeted surveillance and maintain its status as
IHHN free provided that conditions that are conducive to clinical expression of IHHN, as described
in Chapter X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, exist, and basic biosecurity conditions are continuously
maintained.
However, for declared free zones or compartments in infected countries and in all cases where
conditions are not conducive to clinical expression of IHHN, targeted surveillance needs to be
continued at a level determined by the Competent Authority on the basis of the likelihood of infection.
Article 4.1.6.7.
Importation of live aquatic animals from a country, zone or compartment declared free from
infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis
When importing live aquatic animals of species referred to in Article 4.1.6.2. from a country, zone or
compartment declared free from IHHN, the Competent Authority of the importing country should require an
international aquatic animal health certificate issued by the Competent Authority of the exporting country or a
certifying official approved by the importing country attesting that, on the basis of the procedures described
in Articles 4.1.6.4. or 4.1.6.5. (as applicable), the place of production of the commodity consignment is
a country, zone or compartment declared free from IHHN.
The certificate should be in accordance with the Model Certificate in Appendix 4.1.3.
