b) targeted surveillance, as described in Chapters 1.1.4. and X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, has
been in place for at least the last 2 years without detection of IHHNV.
OR
4. A country that has previously made a self-declaration of freedom from IHHN but in which the disease
is subsequently detected may not make a self-declaration of freedom from IHHN again until the
following conditions have been met:
a) on detection of the disease, the affected area was declared an infected zone and a buffer zone was
established; and
b) infected populations have been destroyed or removed from the infected zone by means that
minimise the risk of further spread of the disease, and the appropriate disinfection procedures
(see Aquatic Manual) have been completed; and
c) targeted surveillance, as described in Chapters 1.1.4. and X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, has
been in place for at least the past 2 years without detection of IHHNV.
In the meantime, part of the non-affected area may be declared a free zone provided that they
meet the conditions in point 3 of Article 4.1.6.5.
Article 4.1.6.5.
Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis free zone or free compartment
A zone or compartment within the territory of one or more countries not declared free from IHHN may
be declared free by the Competent Authority(ies) of the country(ies) concerned if the zone or compartment
meets the conditions referred to in points 1, 2, 3 or 4 below.
If a zone or compartment extends over more than one country, it can only be declared an IHHN free
zone or compartment if all the relevant Competent Authorities confirm that the conditions have been met.
1. A zone or compartment where none of the susceptible species referred to in Article 4.1.6.2. is present
may be declared free from IHHN when basic biosecurity conditions have been met continuously in
the zone or compartment for at least the past 2 years.
OR
2. A zone or compartment where the species referred to in Article 4.1.6.2. are present but in which
there has not been any observed occurrence of the disease for at least the past 10 years despite
conditions that are conducive to its clinical expression, as described in Chapter X.X.X. of the
Aquatic Manual, may be declared free from IHHN when basic biosecurity conditions have been met
continuously in the zone or compartment for at least the past 2 years.
OR
3. A zone or compartment where the last observed occurrence of the disease was within the past
10 years or where the infection status prior to targeted surveillance was unknown, for example
because of the absence of conditions conducive to clinical expression, as described in
Chapter X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, may be declared free from IHHN when:
a) basic biosecurity conditions have been met continuously for at least the past 2 years; and
b) targeted surveillance, as described in Chapters 1.1.4. and X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, has
