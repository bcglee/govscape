i) chemically preserved products (e.g. salted, pickled, marinated, pastes, etc.);
ii) products that have been heat treated or dried (e.g. ready prepared meals) in a manner to ensure
inactivation of the pathogen.
For the commodities listed in point 1b), Member Countries should consider introducing internal
measures to prevent the commodity being used for any purpose other than for human
consumption.
2. When authorising the importation or transit of the commodities of a species referred to in
Article 4.1.6.2., other than those listed in point 1 of Article 4.1.6.3., the Competent Authorities of

relevant to the IHHN status of the exporting country, zone or compartment.
3. When considering the importation or transit of any other commodity of a species not referred to
in Article 4.1.6.2. but which could reasonably be expected to be a potential IHHNV carrier
from an exporting country, zone or compartment not declared free of IHHN, the Competent Authorities
of the importing country should conduct an analysis of the risk of introduction, establishment and
spread of IHHNV, and the potential consequences, associated with the importation of the
commodity prior to a decision. The exporting country should be informed of the outcome of this
assessment.
Article 4.1.6.4.
Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis free country
A country may make a self-declaration of freedom from IHHN if it meets the conditions in points 1, 2, 3
or 4 below.
If a country shares a zone with one or more other countries, it can only make a self-declaration of freedom

any observed occurrence of the disease for at least the past 10 years despite conditions that are
conducive to its clinical expression, as described in Chapter X.X.X. of the Aquatic Manual, may
make a self-declaration of freedom from IHHN when basic biosecurity conditions have been met
continuously in the country for at least the past 2 years.
OR
3. A country where the last observed occurrence of the disease was within the past 10 years or
where the infection status prior to targeted surveillance was unknown, for example because of the
absence of conditions conducive to clinical expression, as described in Chapter X.X.X. of the
