Importation of live aquatic animals for aquaculture from a country, zone or compartment not
declared free from infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis
1. When importing, for aquaculture, live aquatic animals of species referred to in Article 4.1.6.2. from
a country, zone or compartment not declared free from IHHN, the Competent Authority of the
importing country should assess the risk and apply risk mitigation measures such as:
a) the direct delivery into and holding of the consignment in quarantine facilities;
b) the continuous isolation of the imported live aquatic animals and their first generation
progeny from the local environment;
c) the treatment of all effluent and waste materials from the processing in a manner that
ensures inactivation of IHHNV.
2. If the intention of the introduction is the establishment of new genetic lines, international
standards, such as the Guidelines of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas
(ICES), should be followed.
3. For the purposes of the Aquatic Code, the ICES Guidelines may be summarised to the following
main points:
a) identify stock of interest (cultured or wild) in its current location;
b) evaluate stockâ€™s health/disease history;
c) take and test samples for IHHNV, pests and general health/disease status;
d) import and quarantine in a secure facility a founder (F-0) population;
e) produce F-1 generation from the F-0 stock in quarantine;
f) culture F-1 stock and at critical times in its development (life cycle) sample and test for
IHHNV and perform general examinations for pests and general health/disease status;
g) if IHHNV is not detected, pests are not present, and the general health/disease status of the
stock is considered to meet the basic biosecurity conditions of the importing country, zone or
compartment, the F-1 stock may be defined as IHHN free or specific pathogen free (SPF) for
IHHNV;
h) release SPF F-1 stock from quarantine for aquaculture or stocking purposes in the country,
zone or compartment.
