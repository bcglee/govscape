began to increase was determined for the infiltration rate
curves. For example for F3, Ti occurred after 13 h (Fig. 2).

infiltration data corresponding to Ti and T > Ti. The com-
posite function better estimated the final infiltrated depth than

In irrigation management studies, estimation of the furrow

cordingly, furrow infiltration functions were also estimated us-
50 ing only the first half of the collected data (50% of the original
opportunity times), and a single Kostiakov function. Furrow
