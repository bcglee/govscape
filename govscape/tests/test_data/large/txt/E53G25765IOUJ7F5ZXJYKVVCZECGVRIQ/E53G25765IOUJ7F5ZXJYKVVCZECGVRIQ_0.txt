INFLUENCE OF ANION COMPETlTlON ON BORON
ADSORPTION BY CLAYS AND SOILS

Boron adsorption on the clay minerals, kaolinite and montmorillonite,
and two arid zone soils was investigated as a function of solution pH
(3-12) and presence of competing anions (nitrate, sulfate, molybdate, and
phosphate) after 2 h of reaction time. Boron adsorption on all materials
increased from pH 3 to 8, exhibited a peak at pH 8 to 10, and decreased
from pH 10 to 12. Boron adsorption was greatest using a NaNOJ back-
ground electrolyte. The competitive anion effects on B adsorption in-
creased in the order sulfate < molybdate < phosphate. The competitive
effect on B adsorption was small even for the strongly adsorbing anion,
phosphate. Our results suggest that B-adsorbing sites are, generally, spe-
cific to B and act independently of competing anions. This result will
simplify the description of B transport in that changes in solution con-
centration of competing anions may not have to be considered.
