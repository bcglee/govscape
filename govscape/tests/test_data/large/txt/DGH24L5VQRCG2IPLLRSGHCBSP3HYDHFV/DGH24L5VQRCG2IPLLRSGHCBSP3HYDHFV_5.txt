Awareness
Dugatkin & Wilson (1992) set out to test a common assumption in game theory models of
cooperation, namely that animals can remember the outcome of previous interactions with
particular individuals and behave with reference to that outcome in future interactions. They
concluded that their experiments demonstrated such cognitive abilities in bluegill sunfish,
Lepomis macrochirus. In this note we ask whether their experiments and results provide
unambiguous support for this conclusion and suggest that this is not the case.

Geographic variation in life history traits and population dynamics of Atlantic croakers
Micropogonias undulatus found north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, suggests the
possibility of two stocks along the U.S. Atlantic coast. The basis for this variation (i.e.,
genetic versus ecophenotypic) is unclear. Young-of-the-year Atlantic croakers were
collected from three Atlantic coast estuaries (Delaware Bay, Delaware, Cape Fear River,
North Carolina, and Indian River Lagoon, Florida) that represent the center and extreme
distributional limits of the species' U.S. Atlantic coast range. Intrinsic growth capacity and
cold tolerance were measured under common laboratory conditions to test for adaptive
genetic variation in these traits. Results were used to evaluate the two stock hypothesis for
the Atlantic croaker and to examine the integrity of Cape Hatteras as a possible genetic
stock boundary. Growth capacity, feeding rate, growth efficiency, and cold tolerance were
similar across geographic locations. Survival curves for Delaware and Florida Atlantic
croakers were indistinguishable at each of four low temperatures tested (1, 3, 5, and 7°C),
with neither group capable of surviving temperatures of 3°C or less. The suggested lack of
adaptive variation we found in these physiological traits supports the hypothesis of a single
genetic stock of Atlantic croakers along the Atlantic coast. Although severe winter
temperatures may select for fast growth and cold-tolerant genotypes in Northern estuaries,
gene flow is apparently sufficient to preclude local genetic adaptation.
