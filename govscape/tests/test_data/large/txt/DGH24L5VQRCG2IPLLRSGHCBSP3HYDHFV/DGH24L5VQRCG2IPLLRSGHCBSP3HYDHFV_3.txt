The possibility that phenotypical correlations between staccato movement (an element of fear
response in novel situations) and several other behavioural elements of paradise fish have a
genetic component has not been investigated previously. The difficulty in determining the genetic
underpinnings of staccato movement has been due to violation of the criteria of additive-
dominance genetic models of applied-classical and diallel-cross analyses. Furthermore, the limited
number of available inbred strains in these cross systems could decrease the number of variable
loci and thus one's ability to detect possible genetic effects including genetic covariation. To
circumvent these problems, bidirectional selection using a genetically variable outbred population
was carried out by recording the behaviour elements in a novel situation, and based on staccato
performance, breeding two high-performer and two low-performer lines and a non-selected
control population. The response to selection was immediate and strong in the first selected
generation in both directions without significant change in the succeeding generations, suggesting
a major gene effect in the inheritance of staccato movement. Phenotypical correlations were
confirmed between staccato and several other elements. However, correlated response to selection
was observed only in one behavioural element (swim), suggesting a genetic component in the
swim-staccato phenotypical correlation due either to pleiotropic gene effects or to genetic linkage.
The other significant phenotypical correlations between staccato and the behavioural elements,
which were non-genetic in origin, also represent a stable correlation structure, which is interpreted
to be the result of higher neural mechanisms.
