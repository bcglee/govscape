Glucose and lactate kinetics were examined in fed and food-deprived American eels,
Anguilla rostrata , under MS 222 anaesthesia (AE). These values are compared to free-
swimming, non-anaesthetized animals (FSE) reported previously (Cornish & Moon, 1985). The
AE group demonstrated a steady but minor hyperglycemia during the 5-h experiment and
significant decreases in both glucose turnover and metabolic clearance rates compared to the FSE
groups. Food-deprivation further depressed these kinetic parameters. Blood lactate continuously
increased during the experiment, reaching values 300 times (fed) and 100 times (food-deprived)
higher than the similar FSE groups. Rates of lactate appearance in and disappearance from the
blood generally increased with anaesthesia. This study supports the view of Soivio et al. (1977)
that MS 222 acts as an asphyxiant.
