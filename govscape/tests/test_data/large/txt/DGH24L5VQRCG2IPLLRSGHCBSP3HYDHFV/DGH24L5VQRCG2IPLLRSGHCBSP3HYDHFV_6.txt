Awareness
NAL Call No. 410 B77
In a recent study Dugatkin & Wilson (1992) tested for cognitive abilities in bluegill sunfish. They
found that when a focal fish was allowed to forage with different companions, it was able to
remember with which ones it had had greatest success and to use this information in future
interactions. Moreover, fish seemed to prefer to associate with familiar conspecifics over
unfamiliar ones. A number of subsidiary analyses were also reported.
