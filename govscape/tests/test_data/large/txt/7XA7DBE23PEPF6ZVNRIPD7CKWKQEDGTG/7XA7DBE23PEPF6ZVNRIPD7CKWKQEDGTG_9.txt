Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 2
equipment (excluding trucks) had 87 fatal crashes in 2006, representing 0.2 percent of the
major category identified as “Other Vehicle” types. The combined “Other Vehicle” type
was reported as having 622 fatalities or 1.1 percent of the total number of fatal crashes.
However, these agricultural related collision fatalities and injuries have more
significance when placed in the context of the agricultural population or when evaluated
based on exposure rates in the agricultural industry. For example, a 2003 report on work-
related roadway crashes by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH) showed that while Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing had a comparatively low
frequency of fatal crashes among all industrial divisions at 7.2%, the 4th lowest of the 11
major divisions, the industries’ rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers of 2.58
FTEs was the third highest rate (Pratt, 2003).
The importance of these fatalities and injuries are significant to agricultural safety
professionals. At the same time, because the proportion of incidents is so small in
comparison to all public roadway crashes, federal, state and local government bodies
rarely give this area of roadway safety any attention. Nor do non-agricultural industry
groups. For example, the American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA)
recently published, “Toward Zero Deaths: A Vision for Safer Roads in America”. This
document contains a section and recommendations for improving high-risk rural roads
but does not mention agricultural equipment (ATSSA, 2008).
Issues relating to operating agricultural equipment on public roads are multi-faceted
and complex (Costello et al., 2008). There are many ways to identify and discuss major
areas of concern. This report looks at a number of issues but not all issues can be
examined in the same detail because the literature in some areas is at best sparse. Issues
addressed in this report include rural/urban traffic interface, state and federal regulations,
higher speed tractors, and transport of workers on public roadways with farm equipment.
Issues with much less or barely existent literature include licensing of drivers and the
interface between rural and urban/suburban populations.
Whether there is literature or not, some issues do not have clear lines of separation.
For example, issues involving rural/urban interface, higher speed tractors, lighting and
marking of equipment, and licensing of drivers are all deeply intertwined. And all issues
can be placed within the context of regulations for agricultural equipment on public
roads, or within causes of crashes between faster moving motor vehicles and slower
moving agriculture equipment. Finally, many issues are researched only sporadically
which means that the literature that is available may be outdated or have important gaps.
This report provides known facts on the four issues named above and offers suggestions
for the future.
