Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 8
Wide machinery also becomes a big issue when farm machinery has to cross a rural
bridge or work its way around utility poles, mailboxes and road signs. In many areas it is
impossible for modern farm machinery to travel down rural roads and not take up well
over ½ the road. The height of modern machinery and lower hanging pole lights, traffic
signs, and utility lines and cables results in equipment shifting partially into the left lane
to avoid these obstacles. Space is also an issue from the perspective of new divided
highways in rural areas to handle increased traffic volumes because middle sections for
crossing divided highways need to be wide and deep enough to safely handle today’s
large machinery.
Any examination of safely moving agricultural equipment on public roads should
look at the perspectives of both agricultural and non-agricultural populations. While no
research was found that directly compared the perspectives of these two populations on
the same set of issues, surveys and interviews with farmers clearly show that they think
the hazards and risk associated with moving their machinery on public roads are
primarily due to the actions of the non-agricultural motoring public (Luginbuhl et al.,
2003; Tevis, 2008). The reports by Luginbuhl et al. (2003) and Tevis (2008) suggest that
farmers believe that traditional rural dwellers (including farmers) are more
understanding and knowledgeable about encountering slow moving farm equipment on
the road than urban and suburban dwellers, and that traditional urban dwellers are less
patient and understanding when farm equipment slows their travel speed. Furthermore, it
is not clear how well urban or suburban drivers understand what the lighting and
marking on farm equipment means when encountering it on public roads.
2.2.4 HORSE-DRAWN BUGGIES AND IMPLEMENTS.
One transportation issue that is having a growing impact on some rural communities
is the rapidly expanding presence of horse-drawn buggies and implements on public
roadways being operated by members of Old Order Anabaptists communities, including
the Amish and Old Order Mennonites. Members of these communities hold to selective
and cautious use of technology to protect their families, communities and way of life.
Some historians and sociologists argue that the use of horse-drawn vehicles is one of the
most recognized or distinguishing features that separate Old Order Anabaptists from the
rest of the culture (Hostetler, 1992; Scott, 1981; Kraybill and Olshan, 1994). Intentional
rejection of personally owned motor vehicles and farm tractors, and reliance on horse
powered transportation and farm implements are intended to keep Old Order families in
closer proximity, keep farms smaller, present a witness of humility, and reduce the
likelihood that their means of transportation would cause injury or death to other users of
public roadways.
Historically, Old Order Anabaptists have been primarily concentrated in small rural
communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Their small numbers and desire to
remain separate from the world around them led to generally few highway-related
problems. When collisions did occur between motor vehicles and horse-drawn vehicles, it
was primarily the Old Order Anabaptists who received the brunt of the losses. Due to an
explosive growth rate, however, there are currently approximately 375 Old Order Amish
communities located in twenty-seven states and the province of Ontario, Canada. In
addition, there are other expanding groups such as Old Order German Baptists and
Wenger Mennonites who still rely on horse-drawn vehicles for transportation and farm
