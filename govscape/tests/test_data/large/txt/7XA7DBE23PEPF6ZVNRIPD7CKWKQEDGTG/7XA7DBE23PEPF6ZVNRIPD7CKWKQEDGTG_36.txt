2. For towed equipment WITH brakes, the following information shall be provided:
Do not tow equipment that has brakes:
• at speeds over 32 mph (50 kph); or
• at speeds above that recommended by the manufacturer; or
• that, when fully loaded, has a mass (weight) more than 4.5 times the mass
(weight) of the towing unit.
• at speeds over 25 mph (40 kph), when fully loaded has a mass (weight) more
than 3.0 times the mass (weight) of the towing unit.
4.2.4 TRACTOR AXLE SUSPENSION.
United States tractors are not traditionally manufactured with suspension systems.
However, a fully suspended chassis, i.e., a suspension system for both front and rear
axles, may improve handling at all speeds. On a conventional tractor without suspension,
the weight can come off the wheels when going over a bump, giving minimal traction
when brakes are applied. The weight is also transferred forward onto the front axle, but
most of the braking power is in the rear axle. These factors combine to limit the braking
ability of the conventional tractor. With a full suspension, as the wheels go over bumps in
the road the wheel and axle are able to move up out of the way of the rough terrain while
the weight distribution remains similar. With a full suspension the wheels are more apt to
stay in contact with the ground which will maximize the traction coefficient of the wheels
during braking and under traction. For example, a full chassis construction allows the
mass of the machine to ‘float over’ the full suspension while the axles follow the
contours of the ground.
In general, the benefits of a full suspension system can be summarized as follows:
• Greater ride comfort and isolation from whole body vibration, both in the field and on
the road.
• Better control of the vehicle by the driver through minimized ground force variations
of the wheels.
• Better handling characteristics of the vehicle for safer use on the road, particularly at
higher speeds
• Increased traction through constant ground force at the wheels.
• Potential for greater travel speeds made possible by minimized body accelerations.
The requirements for an optimal full suspension system on a tractor, whether higher
speed or conventional, are:
• Tires kept such that the force that they exert on the ground surface remains nearly
constant.
• Tractors able to experience large variation in loading either within the wheelbase (as
in a loaded truck) or cantilevered at the rear or front of the vehicle when carrying
mounted implements.
• During high power and high draft operations, power is transmitted through the drive
wheels using low speed and high torque. This torque has to be reacted through the
axle location mechanism with no vertical component reaction.
• Significant axle travel to avoid generating high ground forces when addressing bumps
• Predictable and controllable cornering characteristics are most easily achieved with
equal tire sizes on both front and rear axles.
