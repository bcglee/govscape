the extreme case, if the driver first steers right and then rapidly left (as they would while
driving a car), the driver may be turning the wheel left while, or even before, the vehicle
has started to move right. Or the driver may continue turning right, resulting in turning
too far right. In either case the steering wheel becomes out of phase with the motion of
the road wheels and in attempting to correct this, the steering column can appear to have
elastic properties. In practice, the target response time to develop maximum cornering
force is between 0.6 and 0.8 seconds.
4.2.3 TRACTOR BRAKING.
Fundamentally, brakes serve the function of reducing vehicle kinetic energy by
conversion into heat energy. As a function of the square of vehicle speed, kinetic energy
increases rapidly. For example, a tractor traveling at 50 mph (80 kph) dissipates
approximately seven times the energy for braking than a tractor traveling at 20 mph (30
kph). This situation is exacerbated by the legal requirement for faster moving vehicles to
decelerate at higher rates. For example, 20 mph (30 kph) tractors have historically been
required to have braking systems capable of deceleration at 9.3 ft/s2 (2.8 m/s2). When
tractors reach a speed of 30 mph (50 kph), they are required to decelerate at a rate of 16.4
ft/s2 (5.0 m/s2), which is the same as the trucking industry.
With the combination of higher energy level and more rapid deceleration, brake
systems with excellent heat dissipation characteristics are required. Conventional tractors
have normally relied on either dry or oil immersed disc brakes incorporated within the
tractor rear axle. The oil used is common with that used for axle lubrication, gearbox
lubrication and as an external hydraulic oil supply to implements. Contamination of this
oil with brake lining debris can lead to serious functional problems within the tractor
hydraulic or transmission systems. Breakdown of oil lubrication properties can also occur
if the oil is subjected to high temperatures leading to impaired durability of components.
The weight distribution and large rear tires of conventional tractors have enabled
tractors to generate sufficient braking effort from their rear wheels alone; typically such
tractors have no front brakes fitted. The move to 25 mph (40 kph) tractors in Europe has
coincided with the almost universal acceptance of front wheel assist driven axles. This
has given manufacturers the opportunity to engage the front axle drive while braking.
This technology has also been carried into the 32 mph (50 kph) tractor models, with the
addition of incorporating some form of disc brakes onto the front drive system to assist
the braking effort.
According to the ANSI/ASAE Standard, S365.8, “Braking System Test Procedures
and Braking Performance Criteria for Agricultural Field Equipment,” the braking system
requirements for agricultural trailers and towed agricultural machines are
broken into two areas: one concerning towed equipment without brakes and the second
with brakes:
1. For towed equipment WITHOUT brakes, the following information shall be
provided: Do not tow equipment that does not have brakes:
• at speeds over 20 mph (32 kph); or
• at speeds above that recommended by the manufacturer; or
• that, when fully loaded, has a mass (weight) over 3300 lb (1.5 t) and more than
1.5 times the mass (weight) of the towing unit.
