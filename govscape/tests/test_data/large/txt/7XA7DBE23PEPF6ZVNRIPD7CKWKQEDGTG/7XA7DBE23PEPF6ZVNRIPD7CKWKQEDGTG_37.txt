4.2.5 TRACTOR/TOWED EQUIPMENT TIRES.
Road transport is one of the extreme uses for an agricultural tire because a tire's worst
enemy besides the hard pavement is heat. The recommended pressure not only depends
on tire load (carried by the axle) but will depend on maximum speed. Different
load/inflation tables are developed for the maximum speed of the machine. Tire data
books list weight capacities and recommended air pressures along with maximum travel
speeds.
According to the ANSI/ASAE Standard, S430.1, “Agricultural Equipment Tire
Loading and Inflation Pressures,” agricultural type tires are not designed for highway
vehicle use or to operate at speeds in excess of 25 mph (40 km/h) except for the F1 tires
designated as highway use. For agricultural tractor tires, according to SAE J709, similar
designations are warranted for higher speed travel.
4.2.6 ROPS ON HIGHER SPEED TRACTORS.
The rollover protective structure (ROPS), as described in the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) Standard J2194 “Roll-Over Protective Structures (ROPS) for Wheeled
Agricultural Tractors”, is a protective structure designed to minimize the frequency and
severity of operator injury resulting from accidental tractor overturn. ROPS are designed
to absorb energy resulting from the impact of the tractor with the ground surface during a
tractor overturn. The intent of the standard and the testing procedures, according to SAE
J67 “Overhead Protection for Agricultural Tractors—Test Procedures and Performance
Requirements” is to protect the operator during field operations and not for vehicle
crashes. The current ROPS test standard limits tractor test speeds to 3-5 mph (5-8 km/h)
for rear rollover, and a minimum velocity of 10 mph (16 km/h) for side rollover.
Liu and Ayers (2007) reported on the following concerns for ROPS on a higher speed
tractor: 1) how much more energy should a ROPS for a higher speed tractor absorb; 2)
how different are the impacting forces that the higher speed tractor will generate if it
overturns; 3) how the forward speed influences the energy absorbed by the ROPS in the
longitudinal and vertical directions; and 4) if the current criteria for the ROPS test is
compatible or strong enough for the ROPS of the higher speed tractor. They did not
address safety trade-offs that a stronger ROPS may introduce, such as lowered operator
visibility (especially when entering roadways), the potential of decreased stability from a
higher center of mass, or the increased risk to other road users from higher mass tractors.
4.2.7 DRAWBAR HITCH.
The North American drawbar hitch is a uniquely designed hitch and may not be
adequate for higher speed tractors. The drawbar and hitch pin configuration may give too
much flexibility for stable control at higher speed. A ball hitch (80 mm being considered
as a standard) would be an effective solution but the location of the ball relative to the
tractor rear axle is critical. The farther forward the hitch is connected, the more stable the
towed equipment will be during road operation. Unfortunately, moving the hitching
location forward decreases the turning radius, which limits operations during fieldwork.
