Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 18
visible to the rear of farm equipment and other drivers must know what the emblem
represents.
Another issue is how well SMV emblem regulations are enforced. There is concern
that many counties and states are not adequately enforcing the regulations they have.
This was brought out in a study by West and May (1998) who conducted a survey of
equipment at New York farm auctions to measure the amount of safety defects on
equipment sold. Based on ASAE standards, SMV signs were defective or absent on 60-
80% of equipment.
Finally, a question can be raised of the SMV emblem’s relevance to today’s
agricultural equipment. When the SMV emblem was initially devised and tested during
the early 1960s, most tractors did not travel faster than 20 mph (30 km/h) and did not
tow equipment much wider than the tractor itself. The only self-propelled equipment
found on public roads were combines and swathers and they typically moved even
slower than tractors. Nor was miss-use of the SMV emblem as common as it is today
(see the section below).
3.2.4 MISUSE OF THE SMV EMBLEM.
A continuing problem in most states is the misuse of SMV emblems. They can often
be found marking the entrance to driveways, mailboxes, gates, and on vehicles they are
not intended to be used on. Most states have laws that do not allow the misuse of the
emblem and allow for the perpetrators to be fined. For example, in Illinois anyone that
uses an SMV emblem on any vehicle or structure other than those vehicles classified as
slow moving vehicles in their statutes can be fined up to $75. However, enforcement is
generally very lax or non-existent. Most law enforcement officers are either not familiar
with this aspect of their respective state motor vehicle regulations or they choose not to
enforce the law for a variety of reasons.
While there has been no known research conducted to verify what affect misuse of
the emblem has on collision risk with farm equipment, it is likely there are negative
impacts. For instance, because the emblem is no longer a unique identifier of slow
moving agricultural equipment, faster traveling motorists may not be as likely to slow
down as quickly as they approach from the rear. As explained earlier, the potential hazard
of this situation becomes apparent when considering the rate of closure between vehicles
traveling at a posted speed and slow-moving vehicles.
3.2.5 SPEED INDICATOR SYMBOL (SIS).
Currently, tractors and agricultural trailers are classified as slow moving vehicles.
But as tractors begin to rival the speeds of trucks, the current legal classifications may
need to be revised to either change the definition of a slow moving vehicle or exempt
tractors that can operate at 40 mph (64 km/h) and faster. Iowa lawmakers have already
begun to wrestle with these issues. In 1999, the state changed the speed classification for
SMVs from 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 km/h) to keep faster tractors covered under the law.
Ohio is one of the country’s leaders in the number of high-speed tractors traveling the
roadways. According to the Ohio Farm Bureau, two counties in Ohio have the highest
concentration of high-speed tractors in the United States. Speeding citations have been
issued to tractor operators operating at speeds over 25 mph (40 km/h) because the current
law in Ohio requires that tractors must remain at 25 mph (40 km/h) or less and display a
