work. In some counties such as Lancaster County, Pennsylvania; Holmes County, Ohio;
and LaGrange County, Indiana, there are several thousand horse-drawn buggies and
implements that are used on local roads and the number of buggies may exceed the
number of licensed motor vehicles. The result has been a growing number of reported
highway crashes involving horses and buggies, some of which have involved multiple
fatalities to buggy occupants.
Even though Old Order Anabaptist populations may, on the surface, appear to have
many similarities, there are no uniform standards among the many affiliations of Old
Order Anabaptists with respect to the design and use of horse-drawn carriages and
implements. For example, buggies can be black, white, gray or a combination. Some
affiliations within these communities allow rubber tires while others don’t. Some allow
the use of electric lights, reflective tape and Slow Moving Vehicle (SMV) emblems while
other groups forbid their use (Kraybill and Olshan, 1994). These differences, and the
tenacity to which they are defended, have been seen as barriers to developing uniform
standards designed to enhance the safety of operating horse-drawn vehicles on public
roadways.
The use of the SMV emblem on buggies has been central to one of the more intense
conflicts that have occurred between Old Order Anabaptists groups and the general
public. In some cases where the local pressure to adopt SMV emblems, reflective tape
and electric lighting has intensified, the non-complying Old Order families simply moved
to a more receptive community or to where the codes were not so severely enforced by
local law enforcement. In Minnesota a group of Old Order families known as
Swartzentrubers refused to use the SMV emblem and were ticketed by local law
enforcement. This case was eventually reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court and the
decision of a lower court to overturn the citation was affirmed on the grounds of this
group’s beliefs that compliance with the state marking and lighting codes prevented them
from freely practicing their religion (Zook, 1993).
There are no directly available data that provides for an accurate assessment of the
injuries, deaths, or property losses associated with motor vehicle crashes involving horse-
drawn buggies or implements. Some studies, however, can be considered suggestive. For
example, a study of 217 farm-related injuries to children under the age of 18 from 14
states and Canada documented during 2002 identified less than one percent involving
motor vehicle-related crashes or highway-related incidents (Gilliam et al., 2007). Based
solely upon the frequency of injuries reported within the Old Order Anabaptist
community, it would be difficult to make a strong case that the highway-related incidents
they experience should be a high priority for intervention activities compared to other
injury events. It does appear, however, that these incidents are occurring more frequently
and often result in multiple fatalities and severe injuries because of the limited protection
provided by horse-drawn carriages. In other words, the probability of these events may be
low, but the severity of the consequences is high.
Grassroots efforts within the Old Order communities, primarily facilitated by
Cooperative Extension programs in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana have resulted in a
substantial increase in the voluntary use of enhanced marking and lighting on Old Order
Anabaptist buggies and farm implements. In LaGrange County, Indiana, for example, the
use of SMV emblems increased from less than 30% to over 85% through a community-
wide awareness campaign.
