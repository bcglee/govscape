Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads ii
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health would like to thank several people
who helped to develop and review various drafts of this white paper. Many, though not
all, are members of the National Institute for Farm Safety (NIFS) or the American
Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE). We are particularly indebted
to the NIFS organization as they let us use a Professional Development Workshop
opportunity at their 2008 Annual Meeting and Conference to present a draft of the
document to gain important feedback and suggestions about our white paper.
The Committee also thanks Murray Madsen, from the University of Iowa and a non-
committee member who provided original text on the Uniform Vehicle Code and on
lighting and marking of agricultural equipment, and Marsha Hull, Graphic Artist at Penn
State, for final design and layout of our document.
