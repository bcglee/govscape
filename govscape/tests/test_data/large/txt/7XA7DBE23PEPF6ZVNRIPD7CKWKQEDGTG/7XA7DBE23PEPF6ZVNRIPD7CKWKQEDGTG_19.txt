Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 12
3.0 FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
3.1 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED BY US:
• Guidance relating to farm equipment operation on roadways and lighting and
marking for it provided by the national Uniform Vehicle Code is inadequate and
not embraced in state regulations.
• There is a bewildering array of state vehicle code regulations governing lighting
and marking of agricultural equipment on public roads.
• These state vehicle code regulations have not kept pace with advances in lighting
and marking made by the voluntary consensus standards process implemented by
farm equipment manufacturers.
• Tractors have historically been identified as moving 25 mph (40 km/h) or less but
some new tractors may now travel up to 45 mph (72 km/h).
• States are inconsistent in how they address young operators of agricultural
equipment on public roads.
3.2 WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS?
3.2.1 UNIFORM VEHICLE CODE AND LIGHTING AND MARKING OF
AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT.
Perhaps the most fundamental issue surrounding the requirement of lighting and
marking of agricultural equipment is directed towards the confusion of how state laws
define a slow-moving vehicle or implement of husbandry. Some states define a slow
moving vehicle by its maximum speed; and some define it by use or vehicle type
(Glascock et al., 1995). This variation in legal definition allows for a wide variety of
accepted lighting and marking configurations, and perhaps is a contributing factor to the
motoring public’s lack of recognition of an agricultural slow moving vehicle.
Legislation dealing with farm tractors and agricultural equipment generally reflects
how such machines, historically, were used in the field and spent minimal time on the
road. In the United States each state has its own traffic code, although most of the rules of
the road are similar for the purpose of uniformity, given that all states grant reciprocal
driving privileges (and penalties) to each others' licensed drivers. Ironically, there is a
“Uniform Vehicle Code” (UVC) which is a privately prepared set of suggested model
United States traffic codes prepared by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws
and Ordinances (NCUTLO).
The NCUTLO is a private, non-profit membership organization dedicated to
providing uniformity of traffic laws and regulations through the timely dissemination of
information and model legislation on traffic safety issues. This committee adopted its
first code in July, 1926. The Code consisted of four acts: vehicle registration; antitheft;
operators’ and chauffeurs’ licensing; and a fourth part, regulating the operation of
vehicles on highways. this section prescribed rules of the road, speed limits, rules against
reckless driving or driving while intoxicated, and those governing size, weight, and
equipment of vehicles (Barber, 1927).
Some states adopt selected portions of the code as written by the NCUTLO or with
modifications, while other states create their own versions. Initially, both the regulations
suggested by the UVC for lighting of agricultural equipment on public roads and
