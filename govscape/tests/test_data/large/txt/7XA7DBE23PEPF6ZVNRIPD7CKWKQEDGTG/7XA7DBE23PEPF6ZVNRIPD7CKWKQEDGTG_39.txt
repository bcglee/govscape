Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 32
speed of the equipment and the unprotected nature of the extra rider in the event of a
vehicle crash, whether on the prime mover or riding a towed implement such as a trailer.
Most studies examining extra riders on farm equipment have focused on youth.
Mason and Earle-Richardson (2002) suggested youth falling from farm tractors and other
farm equipment (presumably as extra riders) were a major cause of death for youth on
New York farms. Studies of farm operators suggest a willingness to allow extra riders on
farm tractors, especially those over the age of 14 years of age (Aherin and Todd, 1989;
Ambe et al., 1995), but neither study looked at such behaviors specifically on public
roads, or the work-relatedness of such behaviors. Similarly, in a study of farm youth in
Kentucky, Browning et al. (2001) found that 54% of the youth between the ages of 10
and 18 years reported being an extra rider on a farm tractor in the last year. Again, there
was no specific information if these youth were extra riders while on public roadways, or
if such activities were work-related. The Migrant and Seasonal Farm Worker Protection
Act (MSPA) requires farm operators and farm labor contractors to provide a minimum
level of protection when transporting farm workers to and from farming operations for
work (29 CFR500, 1983). This includes providing a designated seat for each worker in a
registered, inspected passenger vehicle with one exception: when transporting farm
workers to work areas within ten miles of the farm center, where the transport is
primarily (but not exclusively) on farm roads, and where the travel begins and ends on
the farmâ€™s property. The MSPA does not permit the transport of farm workers on farm
machinery, other than the machine operator. The MSPA does not apply to farm family
members.
There are numerous fact sheets developed by a variety of safety specialists within the
USDA extension service warning farm operators about the risks of having extra riders on
farm equipment (especially farm tractors), or towed implements ( Karsky and Jaussi,
1998; Lehtola and Brown, 2001; Murphy and Steel ,1995; Schwab, 1996).
