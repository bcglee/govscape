Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 21
The 1954 ASAE safety lighting standard called for tractor manufacturers to provide
an SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) standard electrical connector socket. This
outlet provided power to a safety lamp, showing red to the rear and amber to the front,
which tractor manufacturers were to “make available”. It called for a means for the lamp
to be mounted on the tractor, or optionally at the left extremity of the towed implement
and be energized through a 22-foot (6.7 meters) electrical cable running from the outlet
on the tractor. In addition, towed implement manufacturers were to make available
either two taillights or two reflectors showing red to the rear and indicating as nearly as
practicable the extreme left- and right-rear extremities of the towed implement. If
implements mounted on the tractor obscured the tractor’s lighting, that lighting was to be
moved or replicated on the implement. Mounted implements extending more than 4 feet
(1.2 meters) to the left of the tractor’s centerline were required to have reflectors or an
additional taillight. In addition, providers of self-propelled agricultural equipment were
to make available lighting and marking consistent with that for tractors and tractor-
implement combinations.
A new standard for lighting and marking of agricultural tractors, self-propelled
machines, implements, and implements in combination with tractors or self-propelled
machines was published as ASAE Standard S279, “Lighting and Marking of Farm
Equipment on Public Roads” in the 1965 edition of Agricultural Engineers Yearbook. It
is instructive to consider the purposes for which this 1965 edition of the standard was
aimed:
“1.1 To provide for lighting and marking of farm equipment for the purpose of
promoting safety for the operator of the equipment and for the operators of
other vehicles whenever such farm equipment is in operation, or is being
transported, on a public road;
1.2 To provide manufacturers with a suitable guide for uniform practice in the
industry; and
1.3 To assist regulatory bodies and educational groups in formulating uniform
regulations and programs governing the operation or transport of farm
equipment on public roads.”
The S279 standard (1965 edition) distinguished between lighting and marking for
daytime versus nighttime transport on roadways, as well as between what was required
for equipment with and without electric lighting systems. Daytime transport of farm
equipment on roads required equipment with electric lighting systems to have a safety
lamp showing red to the rear and amber to the front mounted at the left rear of tractors,
self-propelled machines, and mounted or towed implements. Equipment without an
electric lighting system was to display a warning flag or other generally accepted
emblem during daytime transport.
Numerous revisions and enhancements have occurred to S279 over the ensuing 40
years. Most revisions and enhancements occur in one year and are published the
following year. The current version, S279.13 “Lighting and Marking of Agricultural
Equipment on Highways” incorporates provisions for at least two red, rear-facing stop
lamps on machines designed for travel at speeds over 25 mph (40 km/h) and optionally
for slower transport design speeds. These stop lamps are illuminated by braking control
activation and deceleration rate of the equipment. Stop lamps may be combined with tail
