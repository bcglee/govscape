Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 10
Some communities have enhanced the safety of operators of horse-drawn buggies and
implements by providing wider shoulders or “buggy lanes” along the road for these
vehicles to operate outside the stream of higher speed traffic. Other communities have
recognized the potential hazards associated with the co-mingling of high and low speed
vehicles and have responded by reducing the posted speed limits and placing warning
signs where there is frequent use of horse-drawn buggies and implements.
A national Amish buggy safety committee, which is comprised of buggy
manufacturers from across the United States, has addressed issues such as the use of
L.E.D. (light emitting diode) lighting technology, high capacity/long life gel-type
batteries, use of retro-reflective tape and strobe lights, and the need for training younger
buggy operators. A growing number of Old Order buggy and harness shops now carry a
wide variety of safety accessories to help make buggies and implements more visible to
other highway users.
In 2008, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)
completed a standard that established a unique identification system for animal drawn
vehicles on public roadways and highways. The ANSI/ASAE EP576.1 standard,
"Lighting and Marking of Animal Drawn Equipment," is intended to complement
existing laws, rules and regulations in individual states, providences and municipalities
to provide a consistent lighting configuration for horse-drawn vehicles. The
recommended practice includes proper lighting and marking of both the vehicle and the
animal, such as the use of headlamps, tail lamps, battery-operated or generator-powered
lighting systems, and retro-reflective material, as well as the display of the slow-moving
emblem. The Recommended Practice will affect consistency with all carriages, carts, and
buggies, not just those in Amish communities. It appears that the Old Order Anabaptist
community is becoming more accepting of the use of marking and lighting accessories
that meet current voluntary consensus standards.
2.3 LITTLE-EXAMINED ISSUES.
There are additional issues which anecdotally are known to increase hazards and risks
for the motoring public but for which there appears to be little to no publicly available
documentation. Some of these issues are:
• Collisions with farm animals (e.g., a cow, sow or horse) that are on a road as a
result of a broken fence or open gate and are hit by the motorist.
• Rural road bridge damage and failure from larger and heavier grain and cotton
trucks and wagons, manure spreaders, and tractors and tillage equipment.
• Agricultural equipment carrying hazardous materials like anhydrous ammonia,
pesticides and animal waste in quantities that can pose significant environmental
and personal injury risks.
Likewise, there are ideas which could possibly increase the safety of farmers
operating their equipment on public roads but for which there is little to no
publically available documentation regarding implementation or effectiveness.
Some of these ideas are:
• Use of escort vehicles. Other large size vehicles with wide loads are required to
use one or more escort vehicles. This suggests that a motor vehicle with hazard
lights flashing traveling in front of, behind, or both, of agricultural equipment
provides increased visibility and warning to other motorists for immediate
