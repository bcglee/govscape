Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 17
(122 to183 meters). In addition, degradation of the visibility characteristics of the
emblem is significantly reduced under the Florida sunlight test. Emblems meeting the
S276.5 standard generally last about twice as long as the older material before fading
below levels set by the standard. Since this significant revision of the standard, most
states have adopted the newer version of the standard for slow moving vehicles
manufactured since about 2001. Illinois is the only known state that requires all
implements of husbandry operated on public roadways to display an SMV emblem, new
or old, that meets ASAE S276.5 or greater. Most manufacturers have complied with the
new standards since they were adopted by ASABE.
Most farm equipment on farms have an SMV emblem on it. For example, in a survey
of Pennsylvania Farmers Association members (now known as Pennsylvania Farm
Bureau), farm operators indicated that 77-85% of their most frequently operated tractor
was equipped with an SMV emblem (Ambe,1994). Hanna et al. (1997) found that a large
majority of tractors and wagons (70 to 87%) in lines at a sample of commercial grain
elevators in Iowa were equipped with an SMV emblem. However, the condition or
quality of the SMV may be more problematic.
Anecdotally, many farm safety professionals routinely observe SMV emblems that
are severely faded, bent, cracked or on upside down. West and May (1998) found in their
inspections of tractors and PTO-powered implements at auction sites in New York state
that 80.7% of tractors and 62.7% of PTO-powered implements had missing or defective
SMV emblems. The researchers did not distinguish between “missing” or “defective’, nor
did they define the term defective. It is reasonable to presume that the term “defective”
included badly faded and bent and cracked emblems. Some support for the assumption
that many, if not most, of these deficiencies were faded, bent or cracked emblems comes
from a study by Murphy et al. (1998). In this study, trained farm safety auditors in
Central Pennsylvania considered the quality of SMVs on a cohort of cooperating farm
operators’ three most used tractors. Only 32.5% of the 193 SMV emblems were found to
be “on, properly placed and bright in color”.
Despite the longevity and use of the SMV emblem by farmers, there is a significant
problem with recognition of the SMV emblem by the general driving public. Garvey
(2003) reported that, while older drivers understood the meaning of the emblem better
than their younger counterparts, overall emblem comprehension was fewer than 30%.
According to Garvey, the improvement of the SMV emblem’s comprehensibility must be
addressed through more consistent and accurate motorist education, increased
enforcement of state motor vehicle codes (particularly against illegal use of the emblem
to mark fixed objects), and emblem modification to make it more iconic in nature or at
least to ensure that it appears the same to approaching drivers in daylight and at night.
Lehtola (2007) confirmed that many states do not provide any information on the
emblem in the educational materials provided to those in drivers’ education programs or
for those studying on their own to take their state driver’s test. Lehtola found that in
many states there is no mention of the hazards associated with sharing the road with farm
equipment in driver’s education manuals, and that the training drivers receive regarding
recognition of SMV emblems and farm equipment is inconsistent. Driver’s manuals in
nine states (several being highly agricultural states) had no mention of farm equipment or
slow-moving vehicles at all. This is a substantial finding because for SMV emblems to
be a potential factor in avoiding collisions, it requires that a good SMV emblem be
