Costello et al. (2003) further indicated that 2 in every 100 crashes involving tractors,
which may or may not be towing other farm equipment, and 1 in every 100 crashes
involving other farm equipment (self-propelled or towed farm vehicles other than
tractors) leads to a traffic death. The concern among farmers about the risk of driving
agricultural equipment on public roads was revealed in North Carolina (Luginbuhl et al.,
2003). This study focused on farmersâ€™ perceptions of roadway safety. The study was
instigated after a group of farmers in one region of North Carolina reported an increase
of traffic on rural roads and their need to drive their equipment on these roads was
viewed as their number one workplace hazard. In their review of farm equipment
crashes, tractors were found to be involved in the majority of crashes on roadways.
When these crashes occurred 34% of the drivers of non-farm vehicles were cited.
Typical citations included failure to reduce speed, improper passing, and driving left of
center. In 23% of the cases where the farm operator was issued a citation, lighting and
yield violations were noted. In at least 11% of the cases where the farm operator was
cited, the crash occurred in the evening and the tractor was not utilizing adequate
lighting.
Additionally, when asked about their safety precautions, 92% of the study
participants responded they used signal lights to warn others and 88% indicated they had
an SMV emblem on the back of their equipment. Interestingly, though, when asked
questions on whether other farmers knew the lighting requirements for farm equipment
traveling on public roadways or whether most farmers were aware of the safety marking
for farm equipment recommended by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers
(ASAE) there was not strong agreement (Note: ASAE changed their name to American
Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) in 2005). A majority of
respondents agreed that an effective way to reduce crashes would be to ensure that: a) all
farm vehicles had blinking or flashing lights; b) road officials placed diamond-shaped
caution signs showing a tractor ahead on roads with heavy farm traffic; and c) roadway
shoulders were wide enough to allow farmers to drive totally on the shoulder. Finally,
the study found that most farmers believed that driving their tractor on rural roads was
more dangerous now than it was five years before. A similar concern was expressed in
1990 in a survey reported in a Farm Journal magazine story (Ottey and Fink, 1990). In
