Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 31
5.0 TRANSPORTATION OF WORKERS ON PUBLIC ROADWAYS WITH
FARM EQUIPMENT
5.1 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED BY US:
• The majority of the farm equipment, including tractors, combines, and other self
propelled machinery, are designed with only one seat, which is for the operator.
• Towed equipment on public roadways, including wagons and trailers, do not have
safe seating accommodations for either an operator or other persons on them.
• Lighting and marking of animal-drawn vehicles on public roadways (e.g.
Anabaptist farming communities) may not be adequate to warn motorists of the
slow speeds these vehicles are moving, increasing the risk of collisions.
• There are no clear regulations preventing adults, employees or farm family
members from being extra riders on farm equipment on roadways, or being
transported on towed equipment on roadways.
5.2 WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS?
Farm tractors and most self-propelled equipment were traditionally manufactured
with a seat for only the operator. Nevertheless, carrying another person on the tractor or
self-propelled machine, popularly known as an “extra rider”, is a common practice
among farmers. Reasons for extra riders on tractors and self-propelled machines includes
saving diagnosis, performance and monitoring time, convenience, work assistance,
training, information exchange, and child supervision. Common unsafe extra rider
locations on tractors are the drawbar, side links of 3-point hitches, rear axle housing, rear
wheel fenders, and the operator platform. Most towed farm machines excepting select
planters and bean buggies, for example, are not manufactured with any designated safe
place for riders though this practice, too, is common for the same reasons as people ride
extra on tractors. The tongue of a towed implement, inside or on the bed of trailers or
wagons, and on top of crops and produce are common locations for these riders. An
example of an extra rider on a self-propelled machine would be a person riding in the
bucket of a skid steer loader. Extra rider injury incidents occur while the machine is being
operated in fields, around farmsteads, and on public roadways.
In 1993, AGCO Corporation became the first United States tractor manufacturer to
provide a passenger seat on some of their larger tractor models sold in the United States
(Metcalf, 1993). For example, AGCO Allis tractors between 133 to 191 horsepower and
AGCO White tractors between 121 to 192 horsepower came with a second seat in
addition to the operator seat as standard equipment. The passenger seat was provided
only on tractors with enclosed ROPS cabs and a seat belt for the passenger was provided.
Other manufacturers soon followed suit and in 2000, ASAE adopted ANSI/ASAE S574,
Instructional Seat for Agricultural Equipment, as a standard. As noted by the standard
title, by the time the standard was adopted the preferred term was “instructional seat”.
The standard stipulates that the purpose of the instructional seat is for limited use by a
trainer or trainee inside a closed cab on tractors and self-propelled agricultural
equipment, and that it is not intended or designed for use by children.
There are limited statistics on the number of deaths or injuries associated with the
transportation of workers on farm equipment or towed implements on public roadways.
The specific concerns with having extra riders on such equipment on public roads are the
