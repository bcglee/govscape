Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 13
provisions provided by manufacturers on agricultural equipment moved forward,
incrementally, evolving roughly in sync into the middle 1950s. Thereafter, both industry
consensus standards and what manufacturers provided improved regularly. But neither
the model UVC nor the requirements passed by state codes kept pace. For example, at
the time of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s January 1971 “Agricultural Tractor
Safety on Public Roads and Farms” report to Congress, only one state had laws
conforming in all respects with the UVC and only twelve were in substantial agreement
with the UVC with regard to agricultural tractors and self-propelled machines.
Furthermore, one-third of all states still required only the minimal lighting devices that
were considered feasible four decades earlier.
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s report to Congress concluded that if
immediate corrective action was necessary, enabling legislation at the state level based on
the UVC was the mechanism recommended to improve illumination and turn signaling.
Furthermore, such legislation should be developed to address retrofitting equipment since
it would otherwise take an estimated 30 years before new lighting presentations would
dominate if they were introduced solely on new equipment (U.S. DOT, 1971). The report
did not include antique equipment, a category of vehicle that is much more popular and
visible today than in 1971.
The 2000 edition of the NCUTLO UVC offers that, after a specified date left to State
discretion, every new tractor and self-propelled machine be equipped with at least two
headlights, at least one red rear light mounted as far left as practicable, and two red rear
reflectors (NCUTLO, 2000). The UVC 2000 also calls for every agricultural tractor and
self-propelled machine to be fitted with hazard warning lights visible to the front and to
the rear, whenever on a roadway, to warn operators of other vehicles about the presence
of a special traffic hazard requiring unusual care. Moreover, every such vehicle is to be
equipped with hazard warning lights required for that vehicle by applicable standards of
the U.S. Department of Transportation at the time of its manufacture. However, no such
U.S. Department of Transportation standards have been found.
For every combination of an agricultural tractor and towed implement, according to
UVC 2000, the tractor is to be equipped as described in the preceding two paragraphs and
the towed implement equipped as follows. If the towed unit extends over 4 feet (1.2
meters) to the rear of the tractor or obscures any light, the implement shall be equipped
with at least one red rear light mounted as far left as practicable and at least two red rear
reflectors. If the towed implement extends over 4 feet (1.2 meters) to the left of the
tractor’s centerline, the implement shall be equipped with an amber reflector to the front
as far left as practicable. If the towed implement or its load obscures either of the flashing
warning lights of the tractor, the towed implement shall be equipped with hazard warning
lights as prescribed for the tractor, along with two red rear reflectors positioned to
delineate the combination’s extremes of width. In some instances reflectors are
substituted for lights.
3.2.2 STATE VEHICLE CODES.
Additional comprehensive reviews of state highway regulations and lighting and
marking for agricultural equipment were published in the early 1990s. For example,
Becker (1991) contacted all 50 state highway commissioners or directors to ask about
highway safety laws for agricultural vehicles, equipment and personnel. Eicher et al.
