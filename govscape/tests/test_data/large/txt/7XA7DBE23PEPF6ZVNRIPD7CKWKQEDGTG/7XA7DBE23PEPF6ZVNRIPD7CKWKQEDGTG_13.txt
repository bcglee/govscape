Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 6
this survey, farmers reported that their number one concern was that of public road travel
to reach fields and markets.
A more recent study by Costello et al. (2008) examined driver, vehicle, public
roadway, and farm enterprise characteristics for their combined association with farm
vehicle public roadway crash group membership. North Carolina farmers experiencing a
public roadway crash from 1992-2003 (n=200) were compared with a non-crash control
group (n=185). The researchers found that five characteristics were associated with
increased odds of crash group membership in the combined model. These characteristics
were: 1) use of non-English speaking drivers; 2) use of non-family hired help drivers; 3)
types of non-farm vehicle public road use; 4) farm injury history; and 5) use of younger
farm vehicle drivers.
While acknowledging several limitations associated with their methods and
instruments, the majority of their findings were in the expected direction, based on other
studies cited in their literature review. Two findings that were not in the expected
direction—increased odds of crash involvement—were that farms with older farm
vehicle drivers and farms with low farm income were less likely crash group members.
A recent study in Iowa (Freeman et al., 2008) found that a sample of 1,343 Iowa farmers
did not rank transporting agricultural equipment on public roadways as a very stressful
event in comparison to numerous other events. Potentially stressful events could be
ranked between 100 (most stressful) and 0 (least stressful). Transporting agricultural
equipment was ranked 53.2%. One message that these recent studies (Costello et al,
2008; Freeman et al., 2008) give is reinforcement that there is still much to be learned
about the issues and characteristics of operating agricultural equipment on public
roadways.
2.2.2 SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRASHES.
Several researchers have identified some of the common types of crashes involving
agricultural equipment (Costello et al., 2003; Hughes and Rodgman, 2000; Schwab and
Miller, 1995). These common types of crashes include rear-end, left-turn, passing,
crossroads, and oncoming collisions. Costello et al. (2003) reported five categories of
farm vehicle operator traffic citations as vehicle equipment, unsafe movement, failure to
yield, being left of the center line, and not signaling. These account for approximately
70% of all North Carolina farm vehicle public road citations from 1995-1999. There are
also individual reports of these types of collision events from all around the nation that
help illustrate the nature of these events.
Rear-End Collision. The rear-end collision is a common type of farm equipment vs.
motor vehicle collision on public roads. Lehtola et al. (1994) reported that of fatal
incidents involving tractors and motor vehicles that occurred on Iowa public roads from
1988-1992, 43% (6 of 14) were the tractor being hit from the rear. Gerberich et al. (1996)
reported that a large proportion of farm vehicles are struck in the rear during daylight
(24%) as well as night, dawn, or dusk hours (65%), compared with non-farm vehicles
(4% and 4%, respectively). Costello et al. (2003) reported that the top traffic citation
issued among North Carolina non–farm vehicle operator violations was failure to reduce
speed (29.5%). The speed difference between agricultural equipment and other motor
vehicles creates this potential hazard. It is easy to misjudge speed when approaching a
slow-moving vehicle, you have only a few seconds to react and slow down. Agricultural
