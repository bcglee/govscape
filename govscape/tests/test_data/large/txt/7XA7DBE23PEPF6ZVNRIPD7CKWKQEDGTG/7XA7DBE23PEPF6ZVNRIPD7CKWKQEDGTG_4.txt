Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads iii
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension was formed
by the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education,
and Extension Service (USDA-CSREES) North Central Regional (NCR) Administrators
in 2000. The goal of the committee, designated as NCR 197, was to more effectively use
the land grant system's research and extension capacity in cooperation with the
experience of those who live and work in agriculture to reduce work-related injuries,
illness, death, and property loss. The NCR 197 Committee produced a landmark
publication in 2003 titled, National Land Grant Research and Extension Agenda for
Agricultural Safety and Health: National Agenda for Action. Twelve priorities for action
were identified:
1. Sensors and guarding systems
2. Agricultural equipment on public roads
3. Agriculture confined spaces
4. Emerging technologies
5. Human factors engineering and design
6. Management of agricultural emergencies
7. Livestock handling and housing systems
8. Public policy issues
9. Capital and management intensive vs. family labor intensive operations
10. Fire detection and suppression
11. Agricultural safety education and training
12. Special populations and enterprises
In 2007, the committee chose to develop a white paper on Agricultural Equipment on
Public Roads. This white paper has multiple purposes: a) to help identify research, policy
and extension/outreach priorities for the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and
Transportation, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, state
departments of agriculture, transportation and law enforcement, county government, and
production agriculture based organizations; and b) to identify possible design and
practice standards, goals, or guidelines for farm equipment manufacturers, standard
setting organizations, and government agencies.
Issues relating to operating agricultural equipment on public roads are multi-faceted
and complex. This report looks at a number of issues, however, not all issues can be
examined in the same detail because the literature in some areas is at best sparse. Issues
addressed in this report include rural/urban traffic interface, state and federal regulations,
higher speed tractors, and transport of workers on public roadways with farm equipment.
Several suggestions in the areas of research, standards, education/outreach and policy
have been developed to help guide future work as a result of this review.
Research is needed to:
1. Develop criteria to better describe characteristics of crashes between motor vehicles
and agricultural equipment using standard reporting terminology. This would include
developing model definitions, methods, and data collection instruments. Examples of
standard data elements would include:
a. Road and visibility conditions
