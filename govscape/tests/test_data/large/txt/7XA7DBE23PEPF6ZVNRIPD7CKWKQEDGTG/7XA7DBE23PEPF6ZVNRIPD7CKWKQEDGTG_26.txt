Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 19
Slow Moving Vehicle (SMV) emblem. One problem Ohio lawmakers recognized was
that there were no legal signs available to place on the tractors that would warn other
drivers of the vehicle’s presence on the road. It was illegal to place the large orange slow
moving vehicle (SMV) emblem on the tractors because they are capable of going over 25
mph (40 km/h).
During the same time period that the Ohio State Highway Patrol was issuing tickets
because of higher speed tractors, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological
Engineers was in the process of adopting (in 2005) Standard S584 “Agricultural
Equipment: Speed Identification Symbol (SIS)”. The scope of this standard is primarily
directed to identifying farm machinery that has been designed in its original equipment
configuration for specified ground speeds greater than 25 mph (40 km/h). Because of the
obvious connections, S276 “Slow Moving Vehicle Identification Emblem (SMV Emblem)”
and S279 “Lighting and Marking of Agricultural Equipment on Highways” were revised
to include the SIS on higher speed tractors in 2006.
Ohio legislation, enacted in October 2007, permits any unit of farm machinery that is
designed by its manufacturer to operate at a speed greater than 25 mph (40 km/h) to do so
as long as the unit displays both an SMV emblem and the Speed Identification Symbol
(ASAE Standard 584.1) and that the vehicle does not exceed this documented speed
(Ohio Revised Code, 2007). For towed implements, legislation requires both SMV and
SIS emblems be displayed, and that the implement's SIS match the SIS on the tractor.
This legislation requires the operator to have documentation of manufacturer’s stated
maximum speed of the vehicle, and maintain reasonable control while operating the
vehicle on roadways. In addition, the operator of a unit of higher speed farm machinery
who wishes to travel on a public street or road faster than 25 mph (40 km/h) must have a
valid driver's or commercial driver's license.
A flaw in this legislation is that it requires the two SIS emblems (on the tractor and
implement) to match. This may result in either: (1) operator citations unjustified from a
safety perspective; or (2) encouraging operators to apply SIS emblems inappropriately to
implements not rated for that speed, causing potentially unsafe situations.
The first scenario, citations that are unjustified from a safety perspective, can occur
when an implement with a given SIS emblem (as applied by the implement
manufacturer) is pulled by a tractor with either a lower SIS emblem or none at all. The
SIS emblem represents an official manufacturer's rating of the highest safe speed at
which an implement can be pulled; there is nothing unsafe about an implement being
pulled by a tractor with a lower SIS rating. Furthermore, tractors without SIS emblems
were not manufactured to travel fast enough to merit an SIS emblem, and thus would also
have a top speed lower than that of the implement with the SIS emblem. Since only a
small percent of tractors currently in use have SIS emblems, it is quite likely that new
implements with an SIS emblem applied by the manufacturer will be pulled by tractors
without an SIS rating, which is perfectly safe. The law, as is, could actually encourage
tractor operators to apply SIS emblems to tractors that cannot travel at that speed simply
to avoid being cited.
The second scenario, inappropriate application of SIS emblems to implements not
rated for that speed, could result when an operator of a tractor with an SIS emblem must
pull an implement without an SIS emblem, i.e., an implement that has not been rated for a
speed above 25 miles per hour (the speed above which an SIS emblem is required). To be
