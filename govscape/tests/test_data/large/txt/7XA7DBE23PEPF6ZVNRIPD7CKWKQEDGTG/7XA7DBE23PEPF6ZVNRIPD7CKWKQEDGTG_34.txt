4.2.2 TRACTOR STEERING.
Historically, tractors have incorporated: a) pure mechanical steering; b) hydraulically
assisted mechanical steering; and c) full hydrostatic steering systems. While many older
tractors still in use have mechanical steering, most current tractors use hydrostatic
steering. The characteristics of hydrostatic steering are:
• Low steer effort
• High steer torque
• Limited or no feedback from the road wheels to the steering wheel
• Limited or no self aligning ability, and
• Limited steering in the event of an engine or hydraulic failure.
Loss of steering during an engine failure has been a concern but tests show that
during these situations, total malfunction of the steering system does not occur (Grisso,
2007). The driver is able to steer the tractor within a determinate radius and has time
appropriate for stopping the tractor. Experience shows that hydraulic steering systems do
not fail abruptly. In addition, some systems are self-aligning and are designed with
sufficient hydraulic reserve for the driver to respond appropriately and maintain control
of the tractor.
The response of the vehicle to input from the steering wheel is critical to vehicle feel
and behavior. If the time is too short, the tractor will be sensitive to operate and require
continuous correction to maintain it in a straight line. Conversely, if the time is too long,
the tractor will be sluggish to respond and may create steering problems for the driver. In
