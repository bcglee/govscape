Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 14
(1995) and Glascock et al. (1995) have reported on their reviews of all 50 states for
regulations concerning lighting and marking of agricultural equipment on public roads.
Based on an earlier survey of state agencies (McFarland, 1965), Eicher et al. (1995)
developed a new set of 29 questions regarding agricultural road safety issues. From the
Eicher et al. (1995) study, Glascock et al. (1995) compiled the questions and answers to
15 questions relevant to front and rear lighting patterns. These questions and answers
provided a summary of state law requirements. The questions and answers, as presented
by Glascock et al. (1995), are listed below and in Table 2, respectively.
