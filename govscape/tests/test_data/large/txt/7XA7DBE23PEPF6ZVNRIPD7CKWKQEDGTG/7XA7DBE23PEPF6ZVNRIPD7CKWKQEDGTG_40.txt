Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 33
6.0 SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
Based on the work presented in this report the committee has developed several
suggestions to help guide future research, standards setting, policy and
education/outreach among federal, state and local levels of government and production
agriculture organizations. All of these entities share a responsibility to help motor
vehicles and agricultural machinery and equipment mix safely on public roads.
Research is needed to:
1. Develop criteria to better describe characteristics of crashes between motor vehicles
and agricultural equipment using standard reporting terminology. This would include
developing model definitions, methods, and data collection instruments. Examples of
standard data elements would include:
a. Road and visibility conditions
b. Ages of victims
c. Vehicle and agricultural equipment features (including type and size of
equipment, whether machine or animal-drawn, and compliance with current
lighting and marking, braking, and other related standards)
d. Environmental conditions (e.g., time of day, rain, icy)
e. Driving actions of motorists and equipment operators
f. Whether victim(s) was operator or rider
g. Alcohol and/or drug abuse
2. Assess the understandability, effectiveness, and best use practices of lighting and
marking of agricultural equipment on public roadways. This should include both urban
and rural motorists and would focus on topics such as:
a. Slow moving vehicle (SMV) and Speed Indicator Symbol (SIS) emblems
b. Animal-drawn buggies, wagons and implements, including culturally
acceptable lighting and marking systems for Anabaptist populations
3. Improve engineered systems for higher speed tractors, self-propelled machines and
towed equipment. This would include such topics as:
a. braking systems
b. suspension systems
c. steering controls
d. hitching/attachment mechanisms
e. proximity sensors to motor vehicles
f. tires
g. ROPS
4. Examine the existence and consistency of farm equipment roadway safety information
in driverâ€™s education programs across the United States.
5. Expand behavioral studies on allowing extra riders on farm equipment to include
adults, and such factors as extra riders on public roads for work-related purposes.
6. Determine the effects of graduated licensing for youth to operate agricultural
equipment on public roads, including higher speed tractors and self-propelled
machines.
7. Examine impacts and implications of county and state land use policies regarding
operation of agricultural equipment on public roadways. This would include topics
such as:
