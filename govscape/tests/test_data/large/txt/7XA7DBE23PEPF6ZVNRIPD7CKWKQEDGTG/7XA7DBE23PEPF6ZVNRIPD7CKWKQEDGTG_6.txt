Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads v
Safety education programs are needed to:
1. Educate both the public and farmers on:
a. Best practices for operating agricultural equipment on public roads.
b. Approaching slow moving vehicles on public roads, including the purpose and use
of the SMV and SIS emblems.
c. The effects of exclusions and exemptions from road traffic regulations and
restrictions.
2. Work with local and state law enforcement agencies to increase awareness of county
and state traffic laws related to farm equipment among law enforcement officers.
3. Encourage Amish buggy manufacturers to utilize marking and lighting systems and
components that meet current ASABE, SAE, and DOT standards.
Policy is needed to:
1. Promote the purpose and use of the SMV and SIS emblems in every state’s driver’s
license manual and driver’s education program.
2. Encourage a more comprehensive Uniform Vehicle Code to be developed and
adopted nationally and by states. This new code should better address modern types
and uses of agricultural equipment on public roads. Topics that should be addressed
include:
a. Registration of farm equipment for use on public roads.
b. Qualifications and training for operating agricultural equipment on public roads.
c. Extra riders on farm equipment, including on tractors, self-propelled machines
and towed equipment.
d. Animal-drawn buggies, wagons and equipment.
3. Provide for a consistent source of funding for research into hazards, risks and best
safety practices for operating agricultural equipment on public roads.
4. Encourage land-use policies by state and local governments to better manage the
interaction of farming and non-farming uses of public roadways in their jurisdiction.
5. Encourage stricter enforcement by local and state police of SMV emblem misuse.
