Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads i
PREFACE
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) promotes high priority
multistate research and education/extension through its land grant university system.
Multistate research projects are managed by State Agricultural Experiment Station
(SAES) directors in partnership with the Cooperative State Research, Education, and
Extension Service (CSREES) of the USDA, other research institutions and agencies, and
with the Cooperative Extension Service (CES). In this way, technological opportunities
and complex problem solving activities, which are beyond the scope of a single SAES,
can be approached in a more efficient and comprehensive way
SAES directors are organized into four regional associations. One of these regional
associations, the North Central Regional Association of Agricultural Experiment Station
Directors, approved the efforts of the North Central Region-197 Committee on
Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension in 2000. In 2005, this committee
was re-appointed under the revised name North Central Education/Extension Research
Activity Committee (NCERA) 197. The work of this committee is conducted under the
project title “Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension.” and published
works are credited to the Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health Research and
Extension. Though the NCR- and NCERA 197 committees were appointed by the North
Central Region, the work scope and membership makeup is at a national level.
NCERA committees provide opportunity for scientists, specialists, and others to work
cooperatively to solve problems that concern more than one state, share research data,
and coordinate research and other types of activities. Additionally, these committees
serve to integrate education (academic and/or extension) and research on a particular
topic where multistate coordination or information exchange is appropriate; have
expected outcomes; convey knowledge; and are peer reviewed. The duration of the
committee may be up to five years. Committee membership is comprised of scientists
appointed by participating state research and extension directors, USDA representatives,
and other professionals with appropriate expertise and interest.
Effective solutions to the hazards and risks associated with moving agricultural
equipment on public roads are not easily devised or implemented, but until all
stakeholder groups become engaged in the effort, little progress can be expected. The
Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension took on this
project because we feel the topic is timely, problematic, wide-spread, and under-
appreciated by almost everyone. We hope the publication of this document provides
enhanced understanding and direction to the dialog that must continue with a wide array
of public and private stakeholders to improve the safety and health for people working
and traveling on public roads all across rural America.
