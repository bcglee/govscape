Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads iv
b. Ages of victims
c. Vehicle and agricultural equipment features (including type and size of
equipment, whether machine or animal-drawn, and compliance with current
lighting and marking, braking, and other related standards)
d. Environmental conditions (e.g., time of day, rain, icy)
e. Driving actions of motorists and equipment operators
f. Whether victim(s) was operator or rider
g. Alcohol and/or drug abuse.
2. Assess the understandability, effectiveness, and best use practices of lighting and
marking of agricultural equipment on public roadways. This should include both
urban and rural motorists and would focus on topics such as:
a. Slow moving vehicle (SMV) and Speed Indicator Symbol (SIS) emblems
b. Animal-drawn buggies, wagons and implements, including culturally acceptable
lighting and marking systems for Anabaptist populations
3. Improve engineered systems for higher speed tractors, self-propelled machines and
towed equipment. This would include such topics as:
a. braking systems
b. suspension systems
c. steering controls
d. hitching/attachment mechanisms
e. proximity sensors to motor vehicles
f. tires
g. ROPS
4. Examine the existence and consistency of farm equipment roadway safety
information in driverâ€™s education programs across the United States.
5. Expand behavioral studies on allowing extra riders on farm equipment to include
adults, and such factors as extra riders on public roads for work-related purposes.
6. Determine the effects of graduated licensing for youth to operate agricultural
equipment on public roads, including higher speed tractors and self-propelled
machines.
7. Examine impacts and implications of county and state land use policies regarding
operation of agricultural equipment on public roadways. This would include topics
such as:
a. Risks of crashes with motor vehicles
b. Exclusions and exemptions from road traffic regulations and restrictions
c. Transportation of agricultural hazardous materials on rural public roads
d. Economic issues and costs associated with heavy agricultural loads on rural
public roads.
Engineering design standards should:
1. Be better connected to research findings.
2. Have better representation during their development by researchers and end-users.
3. Be used to incorporate automatic and passive protection for drivers and riders of
agricultural equipment during public road use.
4. Be continually reviewed for the possibility of adoption of new technologies into
design standards and practices.
