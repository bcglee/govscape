Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 1
1.0 INTRODUCTION
A Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension was formed
by the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative States Research, Education
and Extension Service (USDA-CSREES) North Central Regional (NCR) Administrators
in 2000. The goal of the committee, designated as NCR 197, was to more effectively use
the land grant system's research and extension capacity in cooperation with the
experience of those who live and work in agriculture to reduce work-related injuries,
illness, death, and property loss. The NCR 197 Committee produced a landmark
publication in 2003 titled, National Land Grant Research and Extension Agenda for
Agricultural Safety and Health: National Agenda for Action. Twelve priorities for action
were identified:
1. Sensors and guarding systems
2. Agricultural equipment on public roads
3. Agriculture confined spaces
4. Emerging technologies
5. Human factors engineering and design
6. Management of agricultural emergencies
7. Livestock handling and housing systems
8. Public policy issues
9. Capital and management intensive vs. family labor intensive operations
10. Fire detection and suppression
11. Agricultural safety education and training
12. Special populations and enterprises
The name of the committee was changed in 2005 to the North Central
Education/Extension Research Activity Committee (NCERA) 197. In 2007 the
committee chose to develop a white paper on the second identified priority, Agricultural
Equipment on Public Roads.
Terms such as “agricultural-related” and “agricultural vehicles”, when used in the
context of traffic or roadway safety, are not usually well-defined nor understood. In this
document, we address collisions involving production agriculture equipment in public
roadway incidents. This includes tractors, self-propelled machines, and the equipment
that may be towed by or attached to tractors and self-propelled machines1. The type of
agricultural equipment that is excluded includes trucks, equipment and other vehicles not
used for production agriculture.
Motor vehicle collision fatalities are a well-documented tragic fact of our nation.
Over 41,000 people died in motor vehicle crashes in 2007 (National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration 2008). In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) reported a total of 2.5 million people were injured by
collisions. The sheer volume of non-agricultural-related collision fatalities and injuries is
overwhelming in proportion to agricultural-related collision fatalities and injuries. The
proportion from agricultural vehicles is only 0.2 percent of the total number of vehicles
involved in traffic crashes. This is an established trend for agricultural equipment
collisions over several years (NHTSA, 2006, 2005). In 2007, NHTSA reported that farm
