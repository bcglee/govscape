Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 7
safety professionals frequently warn about this hazard (Abend and Hallman, 1995;
Schwab and Miller, 2004; Petrea, 2004). For example, if you’re driving 55 mph (89
km/h) and come upon a tractor that’s moving 15 mph (24km/h) , it only takes five
seconds to close a gap the length of a football field between you and the tractor. An
actual example of this type of collision involved a tractor pulling two tobacco trailers on
a highway a little before 6 PM being struck from behind by an automobile; the tractor
operator was killed and the automobile operator was charged with failure to reduce speed.
Left-Turn Collision. The left-turn collision is another frequent type of farm vehicle
collision on public roads. It happens when the farm equipment is about to make a left turn
while the motorist behind the farm vehicle decides to pass. Schwab and Miller (1995)
reported that there were 297 such collisions in Iowa during a five year period and that
represents 22% of all farm vehicle collisions recorded. An actual example of this type of
collision occurred when three people were injured when a tractor was turning left and
was struck by an auto attempting to pass. The injured were the tractor operator, and the
vehicle’s driver and passenger.
Passing Collision. Costello et al. (2003) reported that the second most common traffic
citation issued among North Carolina non–farm vehicle operator violations was improper
passing (17.0%). Many collisions also occur when motorists pass farm vehicles going in
the same direction. Some farm operators haul equipment that is extra wide or long, which
motorists don’t consider when they plan to pass. An actual example of this type of
collision involved a car passing a tractor with a mower and the car struck the tractor
wheel weights. Too few of the motoring public are aware of need not to pass at farm field
entrances and farm building driveways.
Crossroads Collision. Farm operators transporting agricultural equipment face a
challenge of taking their slow-moving equipment across an intersection. This becomes
even more challenging when the cross traffic is moving at a high speed. An actual
example of this type of collision involved a westbound combine failing to yield to a
southbound semi at a highway intersection.
Oncoming Collision. Many collisions also occur when motorists pass oncoming farm
vehicles. Some farm operators transport equipment that is extra wide or long, which
motorists don’t consider as they approach the farm equipment. An actual example of this
type of collision involved a man in a car being killed after striking a planter being towed
behind a tractor. The car then crashed through a guardrail and into the roadside ditch.
2.2.3 SPACES AND PERSPECTIVES.
A recent Successful Farming magazine story provides an example of how clear
distinctions between rural and urban spaces are disappearing. Randy and Cheryl Miller
had moved their farming operation 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) north of Ankeny, IA, when
they were married 30 years ago. “Now Ankeny’s on our south fence line and across the
road”, say the Millers (Tevis, 2008, p38). Increasingly, there is also a lack of space on
rural roads. For example, in the same Successful Farming issue, Dr. Robert Aherin,
University of Illinois extension agricultural safety specialist, noted that most paved rural
roads are 18-20 feet (5-6 meters) wide while 70% of farmers in a Successful Farming
online panel survey indicated they owned machinery over 13 feet (4 meters) wide (Tevis,
2008, pp36-37).
