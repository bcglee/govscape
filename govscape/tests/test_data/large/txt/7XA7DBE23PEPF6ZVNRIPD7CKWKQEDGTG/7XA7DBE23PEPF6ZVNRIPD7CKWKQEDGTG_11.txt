compared to age 20 and 66% reduction at age 60 (Abrams, 1990). At night, the
peripheral retina must be stimulated at sufficient intensity for an object to be detected. If
the stimulus is not strong enough, the brain is unable to process the information in time to
avoid a collision. Essentially, the elderly need more light.
2.2.1 PUBLIC ROAD CRASHES.
Studies reporting crash data involving farm equipment or farm vehicles are difficult
to compare because terminology is not precise. For example, a state’s definition of farm
vehicle may or may not include pickup or livestock trucks, depending in part, upon
whether or not a state has an exemption for trucks that are operated only within a certain
distance of the farm operation. Additionally, many studies do not precisely define terms
such as farm vehicle or farm equipment. For these reasons, comparisons of crash data
among states must be interpreted very cautiously. In the studies reported below, the terms
vehicle and non-farm vehicle typically include all types of motor vehicles, including
pickup and dump trucks. The terms farm vehicle and agricultural equipment typically
includes tractors and self-propelled agricultural machines, and may or may not include
towed farm equipment.
Peek-Asa et al. (2007) recently reviewed characteristics of crashes between farm
equipment and motor vehicles in Iowa. Included in their article were findings and points
from previous studies relating to crashes between agricultural equipment and motor
vehicles.
• Crash fatality rates in the most rural counties are almost double the rate in urban
counties (Eberhardt et al., 2001; Baker et al., 1992).
• Rural crashes are more frequent, more severe, and more likely to result in death
than urban crashes (Baker et al., 1987).
• Certain types of crashes, such as those between motor vehicles and farm vehicles,
are unique to rural environments and usually involve slow moving tractors with
trailing equipment and higher speed motor vehicles (Peek-Asa et al., 2004;
Costello et al., 2003).
• The environment of the rural road contributes to increased crashes and more
severe injury outcomes (Graham, 1993; Karlaftis & Golias, 2002; Peek-Asa et
al., 2004).
• In crashes involving farm vehicles, the farm vehicle occupant was killed nearly
twice as often as occupants of the other vehicle (Gerberich et al., 1996).
Contrary to the findings of Gerberich et al. (1996), Peek-Asa et al. (2007) found that
non-farm vehicle drivers were 5.2 times more likely to be injured than farm
vehicle/equipment drivers. Peek-Asa et al. (2007) attributed these differences in findings
to differing crash criteria. For example, Gerberich et al. (1996) examined only fatal
outcomes while Peek-Asa et al. (2007) examined all reported crashes regardless of injury
outcomes.
Peek-Asa et al. (2007) also noted that their findings were similar to those found by
Pinzke and Lundqvist (2004).
Costello et al. (2003) examined the public health impacts of farm vehicle public road
crashes in North Carolina. As reported by Costello et al. (2003), this study included a
comparison of farm vehicle public road crash rates among the states of Florida, Iowa,
