4.0 HIGHER SPEED TRACTORS
4.1 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED BY US:
• In the United States, farm tractors, self-propelled and towed equipment often fall
outside road vehicle legislation requirements.
• Tractor speeds have increased in recent years. In order to protect other road users,
tractors and towed equipment must be engineered to allow the driver to retain
control of both the tractor and towed equipment under all conditions.
• Key safety-related systems that may be an issue at higher speeds include steering,
brakes, suspension, tires, alignment, hitching components, tractor rollover
protective structures (ROPS), SMV emblem, and the speed indicator symbol
(SIS).
4.2 WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS?
4.2.1 TRACTOR SPEEDS.
Historically, the majority of tractors in the United States were designed to travel at a
top speed of approximately 20 mph (30 km/h). These vehicles normally featured rigid
rear axles and trunnion mounted front axles with full engineering standards available for
design and manufacturing processes. In the 1980s European tractors, particularly those
with 100 hp (75 kW), began to be designed with a top ground speed exceeding 25 mph
(40 km/h). Physically, these tractors are similar to 20 mph (30 km/h) machines except in
gearing and brakes. Tractor standards acknowledged their presence and were modified to
incorporate appropriate braking standards. Tractors incorporating higher ratio gearing and
suspension of their front axles were introduced in 1994; these tractors were able to travel
32 mph (50 km/h). In 2005 ASABE Standard S390, “Definitions and Classifications of
Agricultural Field Equipment”, was revised to include categories of ground speed. The
standard, also approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), divided
agricultural field equipment into 5 ground speed classifications (Table 3) based on their
nominal maximum ground speed in an original equipment configuration as designed and
specified by the manufacturer. While there is no specific definition of “higher speed”
tractor in this standard, for our purposes, when a tractor’s highest speed is rated equal to
or more than 25 mph (40 km/h), the tractor is considered as a higher speed tractor.

A review of the Nebraska Tractor Test Summary reports shows that of over 500
tractors tested (Grisso, 2007), road gear speed of the tractors tested has increased in the
