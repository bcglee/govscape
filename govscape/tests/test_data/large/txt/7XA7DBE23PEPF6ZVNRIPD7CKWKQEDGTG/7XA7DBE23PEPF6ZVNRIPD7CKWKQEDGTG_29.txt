Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 22
lamps or may be in addition to them, in which case they are placed at the left and right
rear extremities and, if used to meet additional turn indicator provisions, must perform
accordingly. However, if the machine is less than 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide, only one stop
lamp is required. Any semi-mounted or towed implement designed for speeds over 25
mph (40 km/h), or any fully mounted implement that obscures the stop lamps on the
propelling machine, must be fitted with stop lamps to take the place of those obscured.
This is in addition to being fitted with lighting to take the place of any lamp on the
propelling machine that is obscured. A detailed study of the history of the lighting and
marking standard for agricultural equipment has been prepared by Murray Madsen
(2008) from the University of Iowa.
ASAE Standard S318 “Safety for Agricultural Field Equipment” contains one section
that specifically addresses tractor and machinery operation on highways. This section is
shown below:
13 Travel on highways
13.1 Lighting and marking for agricultural field equipment shall conform to
ANSI/ASAE S279 whenever such equipment is intended to operate or travel
on public roads or highways.
13.1.1 The operator’s manual for the unit shall instruct the operator to turn on
flashing warning lights whenever traveling on a highway, except where
such use is prohibited by law.
13.2 Agricultural tractors and self-propelled machines with operator enclosures
(cabs) shall have at least one rear-view mirror to permit the operator to see
the highway behind the machine.
13.3 Hitch pins and other hitching devices shall be provided with a retainer to
prevent unintentional unhitching.
13.4 Components that are retracted to decrease the width for highway transport
shall have means to positively secure those components during highway
transport. One or more types of locking systems may be used. Examples of
locking systems are hydraulic cylinder locks and folding over-center.
13.5 Provisions shall be made for the use of auxiliary attaching systems per
ANSI/ASAE S338 on towing machines and on equipment where expected
uses include towing on highways by single point attachment.
13.6 For towed or semi-mounted implements, instructions in the operator’s
manual and sign(s) on the machine shall specify a maximum transport
speed.
3.2.7 LICENSED DRIVERS
The specific concern with this issue is youthful drivers of farm equipment on public
roads, although it is possible for other unlicensed drivers to operate agricultural
equipment on the same roads as motor vehicle traffic. One example of this is with
Anabaptist populations who work for hire on non-Anabaptist agricultural operations and
have access to tractors. Nevertheless, the greatest concern is with youth under the age of
16 who may not legally operate a motor vehicle on a public road but who may legally
operate agricultural equipment on the same road. Only one study was found that
addresses the issue in any detail. Doty and Marlenga (2006) published a study that
