safe, the tractor operator should not pull the implement faster than 25 mph: to pull it
faster when it has not been rated for a higher speed risks an unsafe situation. But to avoid
citations, operators might apply their own SIS emblems to the implement, since law
enforcement is only looking to see that they match. This inappropriate application most
likely will result in the implement being pulled at a speed for which it was not rated, but
more importantly, gives the false impression to others that the implement was tested and
rated by the manufacturer, especially future purchasers of such implements on the used-
equipment market. The SIS emblem must only represent manufacturers' official ratings,
so an inappropriately applied emblem could result in the second owner towing the
implement at unrated speeds and also potentially cause liability for the person who
originally and inappropriately applied the emblem.
3.2.6 VOLUNTARY CONSENSUS STANDARDS.
ASABE, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (formerly
American Society of Agricultural Engineers, ASAE) is a technical society and the
recognized standards developing organization for agricultural field and farmstead
equipment in North America. ASABE standards are consensus documents developed and
adopted to meet standardization needs within the scope of the Society; principally
agricultural field equipment, farmstead equipment, structures, soil and water resource
management, turf and landscape equipment, forest engineering, food and process
engineering, electric power applications, plant and animal environment, and waste
management (ASABE, 2007). ASABE Standards, Engineering Practices, and Data
initially approved prior to the society name change in July of 2005 are designated as
‘ASAE’, regardless of the revision approval date. Newly developed Standards,
Engineering Practices and Data approved after July of 2005 are designated as ‘ASABE’.
ASAE Standards, Engineering Practices, and Data are informational and advisory
only. Use of these standards by anyone engaged in industry or trade is entirely voluntary
and conformity does not ensure compliance with applicable ordinances, laws, and/or
regulations. There were various forms and forums, ad hoc recommendations and
guidance for agricultural equipment lighting prior to the 1950’s (S Cedarquist, private
conversation, December, 2007). The first published compendium of ASAE standards
was in 1954 (Agricultural Engineers Yearbook, 1954). It included a standard, ASAE
S213, “Safety Lighting for Combinations of Farm Tractors and Implements”. The
preface to that standard states:
“Act V, Section 137c, Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways,
revised and approved by National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws
and Ordinances, 1952, established regulations for safety lighting of farm
tractors and implements when transported on the highway at night.
Specifications essential to conformity with these regulations were
accordingly developed by the Advisory Engineering Committee of the
Farm Equipment Institute, and were adopted February, 1954, as an
official standard of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers.”
The Farm Equipment Institute was the former name of the industry trade association for
manufacturers of farm equipment. Its name, scope, and functions have changed over
time but somewhat similar work continues within the current Association of Equipment
Manufacturers (AEM) (AEM, 2007).
