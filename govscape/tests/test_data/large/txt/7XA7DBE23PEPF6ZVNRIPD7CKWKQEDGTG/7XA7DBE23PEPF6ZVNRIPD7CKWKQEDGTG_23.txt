3.2.3 SLOW MOVING VEHICLE EMBLEM.
In the late 1950s a 10-year retrospective study of fatal tractor accidents was
conducted by Walter McClure and Ben Lamp, both of the Department of Agricultural
Engineering at The Ohio State University, to understand their nature and causes
(McClure and Lamp, 1961). The research indicated a significant number of fatalities
related to highway travel of slow-moving vehicles. A research proposal written by Ken
Harkness, also an agricultural engineer at Ohio State University, and funded through the
Automotive Safety Foundation (1961-62) further focused understanding of slow moving
vehicle collisions and resulted in the development of a unique SMV emblem. Early data
estimated that 65 percent of the motor vehicle crashes involving slow moving farm
equipment were rear-end collisions. The Ohio State Highway Patrol, county sheriffs, and
municipal police cooperated in the research by gathering detailed data on 708 farm
equipment vs. motor vehicle crashes (Harkness and Stuckey, 1962).
In 1962, under the supervision of Ken Harkness, the design and testing of the SMV
emblem was completed. A 1/16th scale highway simulator had been constructed to test
human recognition rates of different shapes and colors mounted on simulated slow
moving vehicles. After testing various designs, a triangular-shaped emblem with a 12
inch (30 centimeters) high fluorescent orange center and three 1.75 inch (4.4 centimeters)
wide reflective borders was determined to be the most effective design for day and night
visual identification. The emblem quickly became known as the SMV (slow moving
vehicle) emblem.
The Goodyear Rubber and Tire Company sponsored initial public exposure to the
SMV emblem in 1962. An emblem mounted on the back of a farm wagon and towed by a
Ford tractor made a trip from Portland, Maine to San Diego, California. The first formal
introduction of the SMV emblem was at a University of Iowa Invitational Safety Seminar
in 1962. Carlton Zink, of Deere and Company, then became an avid promoter of the
SMV emblem and played a major role in the adoption of the emblem as a
recommendation by the ASAE in 19642 as R276 “Slow Moving Vehicle Identification
Emblem (SMV Emblem)”. Among other things, this standard established the definition of
a slow moving vehicle as agricultural machinery or implements of husbandry that
traveled at a speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) or less.
In 1963, Novice G. Fawcett, President of The Ohio State University, dedicated the
SMV emblem to the public. Also in 1963, the Agricultural Engineering journal printed
its first article with color illustrations about the SMV emblem (Harkness, 1963). In less
than two years from the emblem’s first date of availability, Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio,
and Vermont adopted legislation requiring the emblem to be used on slow moving
vehicles. In 1971, the SMV emblem became the first ASAE Standard to be adopted as a
national standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). In 1992, the
American Society of Agricultural Engineers designated the development of the SMV
emblem as an ASAE Historic Landmark.
The SMV emblem standard was significantly improved when the standard was
revised in 1997 with version S276.5. This standard adopted the use of new, more
advanced, retro-reflective and fluorescent material available on the market. Emblems that
meet this standard are visible at about 1,000 feet (305 meters) whereas emblems meeting
older versions of the standard are visible to the driving public between 400 to 600 feet
