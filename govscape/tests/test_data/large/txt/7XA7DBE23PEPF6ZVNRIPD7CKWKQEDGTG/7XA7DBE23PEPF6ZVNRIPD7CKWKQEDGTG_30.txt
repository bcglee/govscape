Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 23
reviewed state laws regulating youth who operate farm tractors on highways in the
United States.
The impetus for this study was the 1994-enacted legislation in Wisconsin (becoming
effective in 1997) requiring youth who operate tractors on highways to complete a tractor
and machinery certification course. Doty and Marlenga (2006) systematically searched
state vehicle codes for references to driver’s licensing and other requirements for youth
and adults operating farm tractors on highways. As with most studies of this nature, other
researchers that try to replicate such a study may come up with different results and
conclusions because of imprecise terminology within statutes, and interpretations of those
statues by state officials. The Doty and Marlenga (2006) findings included:
• 14 states have some type of restriction for youth operating farm tractors on
highways.
• Six of these states require a driver’s license in order to operate farm tractors on
highways regardless of driver’s age.
• The remaining eight states have legislation that includes specific provisions
regarding youth driving farm tractors or other agricultural equipment on
highways. The exact provisions vary by state but include age, location, or time
of day restrictions, as well as educational components.
• Four of these states require youth tractor operators to obtain a special
agricultural permit, license or certification.
Since 1968, the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL, 1968) has declared many
agricultural tasks to be hazardous for youth under the age of 16. This regulation is
commonly referred to as Agricultural Hazardous Occupations Orders (AgHO). With
certain exemptions, employment of youth under 16 for these hazardous tasks is illegal.
The law does not apply to youth under 16 who are employed, either with or without
compensation, by their parents or legal guardians. As part of this declaration, a procedure
was established by the Department of Labor so that youths 14 and 15 years of age could
be exempted from certain portions of the law. This exemption includes agricultural
tractors and specific types of farm machinery. More specifically, the exemption states
that with successful completion of a 10- hour training program, 14 and 15 year-old
youths can be employed to operate a tractor of over 20 PTO horsepower (15 kW), or
connect or disconnect an implement or any of its parts to or from such a tractor. This
exemption assumes that youth are already familiar with normal working hazards in
agriculture; if they are not a 4-hr orientation program to normal working hazards is
required. Additionally, with successfully completing a 20-hour training program offered
by 4-H and FFA, youths can be employed to operate specified farm machinery.
More important to this discussion is how the term “agriculture” is defined in this
regulation. In the definitions section of this law, the term "agriculture" is defined to
include: "farming in all its branches and among other things includes. . . preparation for
market, delivery to market, delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for
transportation to market." This statement allows a properly trained youth to haul produce
and other products to markets, between farms, etc. As a rule, state motor vehicle
regulations that are more restrictive than federal regulations take precedence over the
federal regulations. For example, in the 14 states identified by Doty and Marlenga (2006)
with laws regulating youth farm tractor operators on highways, youth may be prohibited
