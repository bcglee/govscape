Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads 3
2.0 THE RURAL/URBAN TRAFFIC INTERFACE
2.1 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED BY US:
• There is little attention paid to issues surrounding safe movement of agricultural
equipment on public roads by federal, state or local governments.
• Public roadway crashes involving agricultural equipment are, comparatively, few
in number but an important part of overall crashes involving agricultural
populations.
• The impacts of changing demographics that characterize the urban/rural interface
are not well researched or understood.
• Many details of public road crashes involving agricultural machinery and motor
vehicles are unknown or lack sufficient detail to aid prevention efforts.
• There is no available data that provide for an accurate assessment of the injuries,
deaths, or property losses associated with motor vehicle crashes involving horse-
drawn buggies or implements.
2.2 WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS?
The continuing urbanization of traditional agricultural production areas has led to a
substantial increase in the mix of agricultural equipment and licensed motor vehicles on
public roads (Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension,
2003). Farms are increasing in size, often by the acquisition of non-contiguous land.
There is a trend towards greater management of farms by renters and leasers with custom
operators performing many field operations. Many farm commodity prices are at an all-
time high, and new production techniques continue to result in higher levels of
production per unit. There is current interest in biomass as a fuel source. This suggest that
famers’ and ranchers’ production output will reach new levels. Add to these factors the
incursion of housing developments, shopping plazas and other urban developments onto
lands once used exclusively for agriculture, and regular movement of urban dwellers to
small lifestyle acreages. A result of all these factors and changes is an increased mix of
farm equipment with faster moving motor vehicles on public roadways and is referred to
collectively as the rural/urban interface.
The percent of crashes where one or more died defined as rural or urban is 53.7% and
44.1%, respectfully, with the remaining 2.2% identified as unknown. The highest percent
of fatal crashes in rural locations--42.5%-- occurred on rural roads posted at 55 mph (88.5
km/h) or higher (NHTSA 2007). While farm tractors and other self-propelled equipment
(excluding farm trucks) number less than .05% of total motor vehicles nationally, the
percentage of fatal motor vehicle incidents involving farm equipment is almost five times
higher (Hanna et al, 1997).
According to Abrams (1993) the United States nighttime highway fatality rate is 3-4
times higher than that of daytime. While falling asleep at the wheel and driving while
intoxicated are significant factors, reduced vision plays a substantial role. This is
pertinent because of the aging population of farmers and persons in rural areas in general.
As we age, there is a tendency to become farsighted and not to see as clearly up close. In
addition, the range and speed at which the pupil adjusts to differing levels of illumination
decreases. More specifically, there is a 50% reduction in retinal illumination at age 50
