Selection of the proper species and variety
is an important step when choosing a grass
seeding mixture. Grass species and varieties differ
in growth habitat, productivity, forage quality,
drought resistance, tolerance to grazing, winter
hardiness, seedling vigor, salinity tolerance and
many other characteristics. Therefore, selection
should be based on the climate, soils, intended
use and planned management. Planting the
proper selection also can provide long-term
benefi ts and affect future productivity of the
stand.
