Altai Wildrye
Altai wildrye was introduced into the United
States from Siberia as a forage option for
fall pasture. Altai wildrye is a long-lived bunch
grass used as a special-purpose grass to extend
the grazing season into the late fall and winter. It
is a very winter-hardy grass that may be diffi cult
to establish. The plant has coarse, erect leaves
that retain leaf stature after snowfall, permitting
late fall or early winter grazing. It is especially
adapted to loam and clay soils, with an extensive
root system penetrating to a depth of 10 feet. It
possesses a high tolerance to saline-alkali soils,
but it has less tolerance than tall wheatgrass.
Due to a moderate palatability, compared
with other cool-season grasses, it is
recommended as a single-species stand for
grazing. Palatability for hay is questionable due
to limited feeding trials.
