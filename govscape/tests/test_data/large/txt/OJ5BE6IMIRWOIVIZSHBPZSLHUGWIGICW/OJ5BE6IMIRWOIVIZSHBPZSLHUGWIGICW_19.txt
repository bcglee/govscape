Date
Type Release Released Released By Statement of Use
Southern AC Rocket 2001 Agricor United Drought tolerant, vigorous growth, very leafy for
higher forage quality, high forage yields.
Southern AC Knowles 2000 AAF, Canada Interspecifi c hybrid between smooth bromegrass and
hybrid (smooth bromegrass meadow bromegrass. Higher yields than Paddock
X meadow bromegrass) meadow bromegrass but less than smooth bromegrass.
Southern/ Badger 1990 University of Excellent seed production, high forage yields, excellent
intermediate Wisconsin resistance to seedling and foliar disease.
Southern Radisson 1989 Ag. Canada, Testing in Saskatchewan, Canada, showed forage yields
Saskatoon, similar to Carlton and Magna and seed yields lower than
Saskatchewan Carlton and Magna and similar to Baylor and Rebound.
Northern Bravo 1983 Maple Leaf Mills Average forage yields. Maturity date similar to Saratoga
Forage Division and Baylor.
Intermediate Signal 1983 Ag. Canada, Similar to Magna in growth habit, taller than Carlton.
Saskatoon, Forage production similar to other varieties. Roots are
Saskatchewan slightly less strongly creeping. High seed yields and
seed quality.
Northern Jubilee 1979 Maple Leaf Mills Hardiness similar to Lincoln and Carlton, excellent
Forage Division seedling vigor and rate of establishment. Recovers rapidly
after cutting. Very good seed yields. Slightly lower
invitro-digestibility than other varieties.
Southern Rebound 1978 South Dakota, Less spreading and growth habit than Saratoga. Fewer
AES reproductive tillers than Saratoga. Good regrowth
recovery after cutting. Winter hardiness similar to Carlton.
Good forage yields but lower seed yields than other
varieties in western Canada trials.
Southern Barton 1975 Land Oâ€™ Lakes Improved forage yield, rate of recovery, seed size, seedling
vigor and leaf disease resistance compared with Lincoln.
Southern/ Magna 1968 Ag. Canada, High seed quality and higher seed yields than southern
intermediate Saskatoon, types. Yields in western Canada are similar to or above
Saskatchewan those of southern types, but regrowth yields are
somewhat lower.
Southern Cottonwood 1979 Drought-tolerant, rapidly spreading variety.
Northern Polar 1965 Alaska, AES Superior in winter hardiness and yield compared with
other northern types. Superior lodging resistance, less
aggressive spreading habit of growth. Early maturity.
Southern Baylor 1962 Rudy-Patrick Co. Leafy and high forage production, disease resistant,
good stand establishment, good recovery after cutting.
Improved production of high quality seed. Same maturity
as Lincoln.
