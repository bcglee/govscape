Intermediate wheatgrass
Date
Type Species Release Released Released by Statement of Use
Intermediate Thinopyrum Manifest 2007 ARS, Mandan, Excellent stand establishment with improved
intermedium N.D. forage yields and improved persistence
because of higher tiller densities.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Haymaker 2003 ARS, Lincoln, High forage yields. Forage quality less than
intermedium Neb. Beefmaker but similar to that of other
varieties. Taller than most other intermediate
wheatgrass varieties.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Beefmaker 2003 ARS, Lincoln, Forage yields less than Haymaker but similar
intermedium Neb. to yields of other released varieties. Good
forage quality.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Rush 1994 Idaho AES and Superior seedling emergence and vigor.
intermedium USDA-SCS, Good rate of spread by rhizomes. High
Aberdeen, forage and seed production. Largest seed
Idaho of the intermediate wheatgrasses. Not
adapted to hay land mixes with alfalfa. Did
not perform well in trials at Bismarck, N.D.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Reliant 1991 ARS, Mandan, Improved forage production, seed
intermedium N.D. production, forage quality and winter
survival. Improved seedling vigor and
resistant to leaf spot. Late maturing.
Recommended for hay land containing
alfalfa as part of the mix.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Clarke 1980 Ag. Canada, Drought-tolerant, winter-hardy variety. High
intermedium Swift Current, seed yields.
Saskatchewan
Intermediate Thinopyrum Slate 1969 Nebraska AES Strong rhizomatous spread, broad fl at
intermedium leaves, erect form, slate green.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Chief 1961 Ag. Canada, High seed yields. High forage quality
intermedium Saskatoon, recommended for hay land in mixes with
Saskatchewan alfalfa. Short-term pasture. Remains
productive for 5 years under heavy grazing
pressure.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Oahe 1961 South Dakota Bluish green. Good seedling vigor. Drought
intermedium AES tolerant. High seed yields. Rhizomatous
traits.
Intermediate Thinopyrum Tegmar 1968 USDA-SCS, Dwarf growth form (half the height of other
intermedium Aberdeen, varieties). Long lived, late maturing, vigorous
Idaho seedlings. Rapidly developing rhizomes.
Drought tolerant.
