Elytrigia repens NewHy 1993 ARS, Logan, Utah A hybrid-hybrid cross of bluebunch wheatgrass
var repens x hybrid and quackgrass. More upright and signifi cantly
Pseudoroegneria less rhizomatous than quackgrass. Tolerates
spicata heavier grazing pressure than bluebunch
wheatgrass. Excellent palatability. Salinity tolerance
similar to tall wheatgrass. Protein content and
digestibility is equivalent or superior to other
wheatgrasses.
Pseudoroegneria Goldar 1989 Washington Rapid establishment. High forage production.
spicata ssp Drought tolerant but grows best in areas receiving
spicata 12 inches or greater rainfall.
Elymus Secar 1980 Idaho Originally misidentifi ed as bluebunch wheatgrass.
wawawainsis It recently has been identifi ed as a Snake River
wheatgrass. Fair to good seedling vigor. One of the
most drought- tolerant native perennial grasses
available. Can survive with 8 inches of rainfall.
Pseudoroegneria Whitmar 1946 Washington Good seedling vigor, long lived, drought tolerant.
spicata ssp High forage and seed yields. Performs best in areas
inermis receiving 12 inches or greater rainfall.
