Meadow bromegrass
Date
Releases Released Released By Statement of Use
Cache 2004 ARS, Logan, Utah Improved forage yields compared with Regar and Fleet
and better persistence than Fleet.
MacBeth 2001 MSU, Bozeman, Mont. Excellent seed yield, similar forage yield to other releases.
Montana 2000 MSU, Bozeman, Mont. Improved seed yields compared with Regar and Paddock,
with fast recovery following defoliation or cutting.
AC Knowles 2000 AAF, Canada Interspecifi c hybrid between smooth bromegrass and
meadow bromegrass. Higher yields than Paddock, but less
than smooth bromegrass.
Fleet 1987 Canada Dept. of Ag. Similar to Regar in forage yield and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan

Regar.
Paddock 1987 Canada Dept. of Ag. Similar habitat of growth and forage Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan yields to Regar and Fleet. Leaves slightly
wider and seed yields greater than Regar.
Regar 1966 SCS, Aberdeen, Idaho Rapid seed germination. Lacks basal leaves with good
regrowth. The fi rst variety released and provides the
standard from which all new varieties were compared.
