Crested Wheatgrass
Crested wheatgrass was introduced into inches of precipitation. Standard types (e.g.,
the United States in 1906 from Russia and Nordan) tend be more productive than fairway
Siberian steppe habitats. The scientifi c name of types; however, they become clumpy under

hybridize and often produce fertile crosses.
Crested wheatgrass readily crosses with desert
wheatgrass (A. desertorum) to produce fertile
hybrids such as the variety HyCrest. Some
taxonomists do not consider crested and desert
wheatgrass to be distinct species.
Crested wheatgrass is a long-lived bunch
grass used extensively for hay, pastureland and
soil conservation. It has excellent seedling vigor
and ease of establishment. The fairway types
(e.g., Ephraim) are shorter, leafi er and have
fewer tendencies to form large clumps with age.
Fairway types frequently are recommended for
dryland lawns in areas receiving less than 13
