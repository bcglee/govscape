Basin Wildrye
Basin wildrye is native to the western part of
the northern Great Plains region; however,
it is more abundant in the valleys of the northern
Rocky Mountain region and the northern part of
the intermountain area.
Basin wildrye is a long-lived bunch grass used
as standing grazing forage for livestock, nesting
cover and escape cover. It is a very winter-hardy
grass with coarse, erect leaves that retain leaf
stature after snowfall, permitting late fall or early
winter grazing. Due to a moderate palatability,
compared with other cool-season grasses, it
is recommended as a single-species stand for
grazing. Palatability for hay is questionable
because feeding trials have been limited.
Establishment and persistence have been variable
in fi eld trials in North and South Dakota.
