SERDP Projected Colordao, Wyoming Greater seed production compared to current cultivars.
(experimental 2008 Improved seedling vigor equal to or greater than current
line name) cultivars. Less rhizomatous than Rosana and Rodan.
Rodan 1982 North Dakota Leafy with good vigor. Leaves are thinner and less heavily
veined than other varieties. Moderately rhizomatous.
Rust resistant.
Walsh 1982 Alberta, Improved forage and seed yields. Noted for its tolerance to
Saskatchewan, salinity. Aggressive rhizome spread.
Canada
Flintlock 1975 Nebraska, Kansas Diverse collections from Kansas and Nebraska. Coarse culms
and soft leaves compared with other varieties. Aggressive
rhizome spread.
Arriba 1973 Colorado Seed germinates rapidly with good seedling establishment.
Superior seed production. Aggressive rhizome spread.
Rosana 1972 Montana Good seedling vigor and ease of establishment. Good forage
and seed production. Very aggressive rhizome spread,
resulting in a very tight sod.
