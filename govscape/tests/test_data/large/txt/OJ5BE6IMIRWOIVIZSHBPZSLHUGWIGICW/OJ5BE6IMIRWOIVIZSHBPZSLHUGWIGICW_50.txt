Volume I - COOL-SEASON GRASSES
Herbage Production
Slender wheatgrass makes fair to good hay and Fort Pierre. No differences were found among the four
good pasture in areas where moisture is fair to excellent. varieties at the Hettinger, N.D., site in two of fi ve years.
Similar yields in the original study were recorded Revenue had greater yields than the other three varieties
among all slender wheatgrass varieties (Adanac, Pryor in the other three years. The fi ve-year mean production
and Primar) in fi eld trials from Fort Pierre, S.D., in all was 2,042, 1,383, 1,241 and 1,154 lb/ac for Revenue,
fi ve years. Revenue did not establish successfully near Primar, Adanac and Pryor, respectively, near Hettinger.
The fi ve-year mean production was 1,777, 1,701 and

Date
Releases Released Origin Statement of Use
FirstStrike 2007 Colorado, Wyoming Improved seedling vigor equal to or greater than current
cultivars. Taller than San Luis, but shorter than Pryor.
Flag leaves wider and longer than San Luis. Germinates
fi ve days earlier than Pryor.
AC Pintail Ecovar 2002 Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Establishes quickly. Longer lived than slender wheatgrass.
(awned wheatgrass) Alberta, Canada
AC Sprig Ecovar 2002 Alberta, Saskatchewan, Establishes quickly. Longer lived than slender wheatgrass.
(awned wheatgrass) Canada
AEC Hillcrest 1994 Alberta, Canada Similar forage production as Revenue at elevations of
6,000 feet. Seed ripens two weeks earlier than Revenue.
Adanac 1990 Saskatchewan, Canada Taller with less leaf-to-stem ratio than Revenue.
Superior in establishment, persistence and productivity
under saline conditions compared with Revenue. Higher
forage yields, but forage quality less than Revenue.
Pryor 1988 Montana Superior to other slender wheatgrass varieties in drought
tolerance, saline tolerance and seedling vigor. Earlier to
mature and has a larger seed compared with other
varieties.
San Luis 1984 Colorado Rapid establishment and longevity. Performs best at
elevations above 6,000 feet in areas receiving more than
14 inches of annual precipitation.
Elbee 1980 Alberta, Saskatchewan, High seedling vigor, excellent germination. Aggressive
Canada root system, good forage and seed yields.
Revenue 1970 Saskatchewan, Canada Superior to Primar in establishment, salinity tolerance,
forage and seed yield. Higher leaf to stem ratio, dry
matter digestibility and greater smut resistance than
Primar.
Primar 1946 Montana, Washington Superior to other varieties in resistance to head smut.
Resistant to leaf, stem and stripe rust. Good seed
production. Usually 10 days earlier in seed maturity and
5 to 10 inches taller than other varieties. Alkali tolerant.
