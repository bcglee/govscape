INTRODUCTION
Herbage Production from the Growth Pattern and Nutritional Study (GPNS)
Annual herbage production differed (P<0.1) between was closest to the long-term average among the three
years for all entries except Russian wildrye, the Bozoisky study years. Herbage production for tall and slender
Select variety. Differences occurred due to variability wheatgrass, basin wildrye, Russian wildrye (Mankota)
and timing of year-to-year precipitation. Tall wheatgrass and both smooth bromegrass varieties was reduced by
and basin wildrye produced the greatest amount of 50 percent or more in the nearly average precipitation
herbage production in 1995 (Table 4). Total precipitation year, 1996, compared with the wet year, 1995. Although
was 23 percent above the long-term average and no grass species produced more herbage in the normal
growing season precipitation (April to September) was moisture year, compared with the wet year, crested
29 percent above the long-term average in 1995. wheatgrass (Ephraim) was only 7 percent less productive
The Manska and MDN-759 intermediate wheatgrass in 1996, compared with 1995. Bluebunch wheatgrass
varieties were the highest producing grasses in 1996, and Russian wildrye (Bozoisky Select) were lower in
followed by Altai and basin wildrye (Table 4). Annual and herbage production in 1996, compared with 1995, by
growing season precipitation was slightly above average, 14 percent and 17 percent, respectively. All other grass
17 percent and 11 percent, respectively, compared with varieties were reduced by 30 percent to 50 percent in
the long-term averages in 1996. The 1996 precipitation 1996, compared with 1995.
