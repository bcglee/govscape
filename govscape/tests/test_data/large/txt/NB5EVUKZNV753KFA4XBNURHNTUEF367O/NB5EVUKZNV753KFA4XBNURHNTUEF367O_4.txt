method gave irreproducible results for us, suggesting that the formation of
dioxin-micelles was variable or that the interaction of the dioxin-micelles with antibody
was variable. Using BSA as a carrier seems to have alleviated this problem, and our
competition curves are nearly identical run-to-run. In addition, the initial protocol called
for drying the dioxin and Cutscum under nitrogen which was time consuming. The
direct mixing of dioxin solution with BSA solution eliminates this step, although it does
seem that an extended period of sonication is needed to achieve consistent results.
Plans for the Immediate Future
The binding specificity of DD-1, DD-3, and DD-4 will be characterized further in
competition ELISA. In addition we will completely characterize the binding of our other
candidate monoclonal antibodies, DD-5 and DD-6. We will add to the list of test
compounds tested unchlorinated and lightly chorinated (mono, di, and tri)
dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans. It is important for us to determine quantitatively
how well these antibodies can discriminate TCDD from other chemicals that could be
present at much higher concentrations in samples. For example, in transformer dump
sites the concentration of RGB's may be several thousand-fold more concentrated than
the TCDD. The degree of specificity that we have observed so far is encouraging, but
we have not evaluated the potential for interference in the immunoassay of very high
concentrations of PCB's. Similarly, in herbicide and chemical waste sites 2,4,5-T,
hexochlorobenzine, or DDT may be vast excess. As such, we will test other
chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as DDT, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, hexachlorobenzine, and
trichlorophenol in concentrations up to 10 ppm.
The immunoassay protocol will be optimized using 14C-dioxin. The radiolabel will be
followed during the ELISA assay to assure ourselves that we are quantitatively
removing the dioxin from spiked soil samples, concentrating it in hexane, and
adsorbing it onto the BSA.
Publications
Three meeting abstracts have been submitted based on this work, and copies are
attached. Two are to the IUPAC meeting on Pesticide Chemistry in Ottawa, Canada,
August 1986. Bruce Watkins and Martin Vanderlaan will attend that meeting. The third
is to a workshop on biotechnology being sponsored by the Army in Cashiers, North
Carolina.and Larry Stanker will attend.
