Figure 1 shows the results of a competition ELISA using monoclonal antibody DD-1.
A-TriCDD-RSA was adsorbed onto the surface of the wells of a microtiter plate. The
various competitors listed were suspendend in saline containing bovine serum
albumin (BSA). These solutions were made by sonicating 10 u.l of dioxin in hexane
with 500 (il of saline-BSA. The dioxins appear to be adsorbed to the BSA and thereby
remain suspended in the aqueous solution. A dilution series of these dioxin-BSA
solutions was then made covering the range of 100-0.2 ppb, and placed in the
microtiter plate wells. An equal volume of DD-1 monoclonal antibody was then added,
and allowed to react for 1 hour. The antibody binds either to the A-TriCDD-RSA on the
plate or the dioxin-BSA in solution. After the hour, the solution phase is removed, the
plate washed, and it is reincubated for an hour with peroxidase-conjugated
goat-anti-mouse-immunoglobulins. A second washing is then done, and substrate
(ABTS) added for the peroxidase. The enzyme-antibody conjugate and substrate
function as a "developer", allowing the visualization of the DD-1 bound to the
A-triCDD-RSA on the plate. Results are then expressed as a fraction of the response
in wells with no competitor. In this example, DD-1 does not react with
octachlorodibenzodioxin. At about 20 ppb of 2,3,7,8-TCDD the relative ELISA
response is half of control, meaning that half the DD-1 antibody bound to the solution
phase dioxin-BSA and half bound to the A-triCDD-RSA on the plate. For
1,2,3,7(8)-TCDD, 50% inhibition occurs at about 4 ppb, indicating that DD-1 prefers
1,2,3,7(8)-TCDD to 2,3,7,8-TCDD.
