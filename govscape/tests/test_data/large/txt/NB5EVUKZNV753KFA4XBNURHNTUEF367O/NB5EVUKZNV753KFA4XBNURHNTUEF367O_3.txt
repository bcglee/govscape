The results are shown in Figure 1 and Table I, while the details of the ELISA method
are discussed at the end of this section. Figure 1 shows representative competition
data for DD-1 using several chlorinated compounds as competitors. From each of
these curves, and others like them for DD-1 and DD-4, one may read the concentration
required to inhibit antibody binding by 50% (150). Table I lists the (50 for all
compounds tested so far with the DD-1, DD-3, and DD-4 antibodies. In reporting these
values, factors of two are about the limit of significance. All three antibodies have
highest affinity for tetrachlorodibenzodioxins, with highest affinity for the mixed isomers
(1,2,3,7/1,2,3,8). They have slightly less affinity for the 2,3,7,8-TCDD and
2,3,7,8-TCDBF. DD-4 has some reactivity with the 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexa-CDD. Up to the
highest concentration tested (100 ppb) all three antibodies either do not react or react
only marginally with hexachloro-DBF, octachloro-DBF, octachloro-DD, and PCB's. The
binding specificities of these three antibodies are highly desirable, since they prefer
the most toxic of the dioxin and dibenzofuran isomers.
It is our experience that different mice will produce clones with different binding
specificity and affinity. Each mouse appears nearly unique in the way it responds to an
immunogen. Multiple clones from the same mouse are often quite similar, as is
exemplified by DD-1 and DD-3. As such, we are interested in deriving a set of
monoclonal antibodies from different mice, and DD-4 is the first example of that. We
have selected two other hybridomas, DD-5 and DD-6 from different mice using the
same basic protocol for the first three clones. It is premature to comment on their
specificities, except to say that all recognize 2,3,7,8-TCDD. A detailed
characterization of their binding properties is in progress.
A large part of the success that we have had in characterizing the binding specificities
of our monoclonal antibodies comes from having developed a reliable competition
ELISA protocol. Our current assay starts from stock solutions at 10 ppm in hexane of
the various compounds listed in table I. 10jil of hexane solution is aliquoted into a
small vial, and 500|oJ of phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% BSA is added. The vial is
capped and placed in an ultrasonic cleaning waterbath for two hours. Apparently the
dioxin, because of its hydrophobicity, becomes adsorbed to the BSA. Two hours of
sonication gives a more reproducible assay than does one hour. During the sonication
the hexane appears to evaporate completely, and one is left with an aqueous solution
containing the dioxin. While the dioxin is mixing with the BSA solution, a microtiter
plate is coated with A-triCDD-RSA. A two-fold dilution series of sonicated dioxin-BSA
is then made, covering the range 100 ppb-0.1 ppb. In each well of the plate 100 |o.l of
the sonicated dioxin-BSA solution is mixed with an equal volume of antibody. The
antibody partitions between the dioxin adsorbed to the BSA, and the A-tri-CDD-RSA
on the plate.
This assay has several advantages over the detergent (Cutscum) micelle solubilization
method developed by Dr. Albro and adapted to ELISA by us initially. The detergent
