Summary of Progress
Three major accomplishments have been made during the past three months:
1. The binding specificities of three monoclonal antibodies, DD-1, DD-3, and DD-4 to
dioxins have been determined for sixteen compounds. All three antibodies have a
strong preference for the tetrachloro isomers of dioxin and dibenzofuran relative to
more highly chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls.
Large lots of these monoclonal antibodies have been produced.
2. Two additional monoclonal antibodies, DD-5 and DD-6, have been selected. The
binding specificities of these antibodies have not yet been characterized extensively,
although they recognize 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzodioxin. Large scale antibody
production and characterization of these monoclonal antibodies is in progress.
3. An improved immunoassay protocol has been developed using DD-1. Unlike the
original method, where the dioxin was suspended in water using detergent, we now
solubilize the dioxin by adsorbing it onto protein. This new method is more
reproducible and takes less time to complete than the old method, and retains a
detection limit of about 1 ppb.
All of these accomplishments are well ahead of our projected milestone timetable.
Detailed Report of Progress
Three hybridomas, DD-1, DD-3, and DD-4, have been produced. Briefly, the protocol
used to generate these hybridomas was to immunize mice with
1-amino-3,7,8-trichloro-dibenzodioxin (A-triCDD) conjugated to bovine serum albumin
(BSA). A total of 9 injections of 10 jig/injection in adjuvant were given over 10 months.
A tenth injection was given four days before taking the spleen cells for fusing. DD-1
and DD-3 came from the same BALB/c mouse spleen. DD-4 came from a Biozzi
mouse. In both cases, the splenocytes were fused with the SP2/0 mouse myeloma cell
line, and hybridomas were initially selected for their abilities to distinguish
A-triCDD-rabbit-serum-albumin (A-triCDD-RSA) from rabbit serum albumin (RSA).
Next, the antibodies produced by these cells were tested for their ability to recognize
2,3,7,8-TCDD in solution at concentrations of 100 ppb or less. The clones DD-1, DD-3,
and DD-4 were selected for further culture and characterization because they had the
greatest sensitivity to free TCDD. The cells were subcloned twice to insure that they
were "monoclonal", and stock cultures have been frozen for long-term storage. About
100 mg of each monoclonal antibody has been produced and purified.
The binding specificities of the monoclonal antibodies secreted by these clones have
been determined using a competition Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
