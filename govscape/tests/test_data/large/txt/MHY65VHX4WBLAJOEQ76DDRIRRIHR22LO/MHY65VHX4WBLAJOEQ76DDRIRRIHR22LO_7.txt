INTRODUCTION
On October 29, 1969, the President's Science Advisor, Dr. Lee A/.
s
DuBridge, announced that a series of coordinated actions was being taken
by several governmental agencies to restrict the use of the herbicide
2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). This was precipitated by
release a few days earlier of the findings of a large-scale screening
study of a number of pesticides and industrial chemicals conducted by
Bionetics Research Laboratories in which it was found that mice and
rats treated during early pregnancy with large doses of 2,4,5-T gave
birth to defective offspring.
The announcement, together with reports of an increased occurrence
of birth defects by South Vietnamese newspapers during June and July
1969, elicited far-reaching reactions from governmental agencies,
segments of the scientific community, various lay groups concerned with
environmental problems, and from the public communications media.
Government-sponsored panels of experts, special commissions set up by
scientific organizations, hearings before subcommittees of the U.S.
Senate, and conferences attended by representatives.from industry,,
government, and universities examined available data and heard expert
opinions. None of these groups, however, was able to provide a
generally acceptable answer' to the central question of whether 2,4,5-T,
as currently produced and'usad, constituted a risk for human pregnancy.
At least one reason for failure to reach a>satisfactory resolution of
the issue was the paucity of reliable, scientific evidence.
Additional animal experiments performed early in 1970 confirmed
that the purest available sample of 2,4,5-T, given in large doses to
