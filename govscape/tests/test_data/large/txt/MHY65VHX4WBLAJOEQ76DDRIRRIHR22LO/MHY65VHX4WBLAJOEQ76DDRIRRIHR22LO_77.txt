The Report Fails to Consider the Uncertainty
About the Fate of TGDP
It is not possible to produce 2,H,5-T without impurities, especially
the dioxin TCDD. These impurities have been shown to be toxic and terato-
genic in the extreme. (In fact, the recommendations of the report to restrict
the permissible level of TCDD in 2,lj,5-T and to monitor this restriction is
in recognition of its hazard.)
While 2,if,5-T is quickly eliminated from the soil by biological and
other actions, the same cannot be said of TCDD. The report notes that TCDD
might accumulate in the soil from one year to the next. There is also
evidence that a small amount of the soil's TCDD is absorbed by plants. But
there is no information on the concentration of TCDD in the food chain at
this level, nor is there information as to what extent TCDD may be stored
by animal tissues. Again, the report speculates that TCDD is not stored to
a significant extent because it is not easily soluble in oils. However,
may it not be stored by other tissues besides fat, and, in fact, may it not
be stored more by animal fatty cells than in oils? (There is some evidence
that TCDD, when digested, finds its way to every tissue in the body.)
There is no question but that some doubts exist in the minds of the
committee on this point. The recommendations acknowledge these doubts and
ask that the deficiency in information relative to possible accumulation in
the soil and possible magnification in the food chain of the dioxin TCDD
be rectified by specific research directed to this end, with this question
to be subjected to scientific review within three years of the present date
and yearly thereafter until these questions are resolved (Section 3 of Final
Draft Recommendations).
