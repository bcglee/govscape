The data in the accompanying table indicate that a single dose of 100
rag/kg at a highly sensitive time in rat emhryogenesis did not cause an
increase in abnormal development or a decrease in intrauterine growth
but did cause a slight increase in intrauterine death. This effect was
accentuated at higher doses and a moderate increase in malformations above
control levels was also noted. Intrauterine growth was affected only at
400 mg/kg, a dose sufficient to cause severe embryotoxicity as evidenced
by complete resorption of 2 of the 10 whole lititers.
In summary, it appears that rat strains vary considerably in their
susceptibility to the embryotoxic effects of 2,4,5-T. A low level of
teratogenicity may appear in some strains when repeated dosage exceeds
100 mg/kg/day, or single dosage on day 9 is at 200 to 400 mg/kg of maternal
weight. Some increase in intrauterine death and decrease in intrauterine
growth, as well as maternal toxicity, was sometimes noted at lower daily
dosage, e.g., 50 mg/kg.
TCDD in rats. Rats have been treated during pregnancy with TCDD in

appreciable dosage in only two laboratories. At the Dow Chemical Co. ~
pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.00003, 0.000125, 0.0005, 0.002,
or 0.008 mg/kg/day of dioxin (91% TCDD) orally on days 6 through 15 of
gestation. Only one maternal death occurred and maternal weight gain
was depressed only by the largest doses. Prenatal mortality was greatly
increased at the 0.002 mg/kg dosage and all fetuses were killed at the
0.008 mg/kg level. Fetal weight was greatly reduced at 0.002 mg/kg and
somewhat reduced at lower doses. Only two offspring had possible malforma-
tions of the tail and limbs. Edema and intestinal hemorrhage were observed
in some offspring of females treated with 0.000125, 0.0005, or 0.002 mg/kg.
