It is scientifically impossible to prove that a chemical is without
hazard. Pesticide regulations now require that new agents be tested for
acute and chronic toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. These tests
may involve the use of two or more species of animals taken through several
generations and the examination of thousands of individuals. Since it is
necessary to extrapolate from effects in test animals to man and since
species are known to differ in sensitivity to chemicals, the permissible
residue levels in food must always be many-fold below the minimal effect
level for the species tested. Concern that some unexpected detrimental
occurrence may outweigh the benefit of a pesticide has doubtless been
heightened by the finding that DDT residues in the environment have adverse-
ly affected reproduction in certain predatory avian species that are at the
top of their food chains and, as a consequence, ingest large accumulations
of this persistent compound.
With these considerations in mind the Advisory Committee has exam-
ined all available information relating to factors that may influence
human exposure to 2,4,5-T and the toxic reactions, nonteratogenic as well
as teratogenic, such exposure of man and other animal species may entail.
