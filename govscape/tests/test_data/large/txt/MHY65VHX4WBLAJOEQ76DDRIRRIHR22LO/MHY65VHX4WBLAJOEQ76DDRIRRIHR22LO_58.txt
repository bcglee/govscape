from evenly distributed throughout the country, the three capital-area
hospitals contributing over 67% of the total. In addition, the Chinese,

who comprise a significant fraction of the population (over one million)—- ,
were probably completely omitted since, as was stated by the Army report,
they did not attend the hospitals surveyed. Finally, any hope of relating
the results to variations in the degree or geographical region of herb-
icide spraying was frustrated by a number of factors. For example, changes
in the local practices of referring difficult obstetrical cases to pro-
vincial hospitals, determined by availability of trained personnel in the
centers, and increasing with gradual improvement in transportation and
security, probably greatly influenced stillbirth and malformation rates in
•specific hospitals.
Probably most significant was the fact that populations most
heavily exposed to 2,4,5-T were those most likely to be underrepresented
in the Army survey or to be inadequately dealt with when recorded. Thus,
as the HAG report stated, the bulk of 2,4,5-T used in Vietnam was sprayed
in relatively remote and sparsely populated areas; the population directly
exposed to 2,4,5-T probably did not exceed 5% and may have been 1% or less
of the total population of Vietnam; and very likely a significant pro-
portion of the exposed population consisted of Montagnard people, whose
births usually did not occur in hospitals and rarely were included in
medical records or statistics. It is equally probable that other remote
and lightly populated areas were similarly underrepresented and incom-
pletely recorded.
The Army survey noted that during 1960-69 there was a countrywide
downward trend in the stillbirth rate. But, as was pointed out in the
