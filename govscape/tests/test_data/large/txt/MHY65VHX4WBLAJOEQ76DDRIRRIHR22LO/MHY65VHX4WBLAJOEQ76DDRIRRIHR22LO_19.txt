or on soil and water in the vicinity, although as indicated for 2,4,5-T,
smaller amounts could enter air or water and be carried some distance from
the site of application. Water transport, however, is sharply limited by

the fact that the solubility of TCDD in water is only 0.2 ppb.— As a
consequence it would tend to remain on the surface of plants and soil at
the site of application.
Photochemical decomposition of TCDD has been studied at Dow Chemical
37/ og/
Co.— and the United States Department of Agriculture.— Exposure of
1.02 mg of TCDD in 100 ml of water-saturated chloroform to ultraviolet
light at 35°C caused 50 to 100% degradation in 2.5 hours. The Department
of Agriculture, using a sunlamp with a peak emission at 310 nm, irradiated
TCDD dissolved in methanol and found it to have a half-life of 3.5 hours.
Rapid decomposition was also reported in natural sunlight when approximately
5 ml of a 24-ppm methanol solution of TCDD was sealed in glass tubes and
exposed to 7,000 to 9,000 footcandles of sunlight, with a half-life of
approximately 5 hours, virtual disappearance in 48 hours, and none detect-
able after 72 hours. Similar rates of decomposition, however, were not
observed when the TCDD was placed on the surface of dry soil where irradia-
tion for 96 hours with a sunlamp (maximum energy at 310 nm) did not cause
any significant loss by either photodecomposition or volatilization. The
same was true for wet soil irradiated for 6 hours.
Interactions of TCDD with soil have also been studied by the United
39 /
States Department of Agriculture.— When TCDD was placed on the surface
of five very different soils and subjected to leaching with water, the
TCDD did not move into any of the soils, probably because of its very
low water solubility. Similarly, in leaching experiments using soil thin-
