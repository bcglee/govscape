Sweden has commissioned a study in pregnant rhesus monkeys â€” at doses
of 5, 10, 20 and 40 tng/kg given three times per week for 4 weeks between
days 20 and 48 of gestation. The sample of 2,4,5-T contained 0.5 ppm of
TCDD. Twelve fetuses removed by hysterotomy at 100 days of gestation
from females treated with one of the three lower doses (4 pregnancies
each dose), were developmentally normal and fell within the range, of
weight for untreated fetuses of this age. Two of 4 pregnant females
treated with the highest dose yielded normal fetuses and the other 2
have not been hysterotorn!zed at this writing but are still pregnant.
One- f emajL treated at this level aborted on day 61 of gestation and the
conceptus was too macerated for examination. Abortion rate among
untreated females in this colony is about 7% prior to day 100 of gestation.
Summarizing available data on exposure of pregnant laboratory
animals, it is notable that rats were used most often and under the
widest variety of conditions. Pregnant females of several stocks
received orally administered low-dioxin-content 2,4,5-T in doses up to
400 mg/kg for durations varying from single treatment to periods includ-
ing much of embryonic development. In the studies in which dosage was
kept below the toxic level for the pregnant females malformed offspring
rarely occurred, and at higher dosages only a low teratogenic potential
was revealed. Results of rat studies with TCDD were variable. In two
of three experiments very few malformed young occurred, but in the third
an appreciable incidence of cleft palate was reported.
Mice proved to be more susceptible than the other species to the
embryotoxic effects of both 2,4,5-T and TCDD. Both compounds produced
low to moderate frequencies of cleft palate in all stocks tested but
