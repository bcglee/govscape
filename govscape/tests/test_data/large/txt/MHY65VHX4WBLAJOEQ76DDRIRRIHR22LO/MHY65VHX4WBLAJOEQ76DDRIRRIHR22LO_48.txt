fetuses was reduced. At the higher doses there was also increased
skeletal variations some of which did not occur spontaneously in
controls. Postnatal survival of young was not adversely affected
by maternal dosage with 100 rag/kg. The 2,4,5-T butyl ester was without
effect.
The foregoing rat experiments all involved repeated daily treatment
of pregnant females with 2,4,5-T. The possibility exists, that owing
to maternal homeostatic mechanisms, e.g., inducation or inhibition of
metabolic enzymes, the most sensitive teratological test would be one
involving a single treatment during early organogenesis. To test this
possibility rat experiments were carried out at the Institute of
Developmental Research, Children's Hospital Research Foundation of
Cincinnati ^-'. Using a sample of 2,4,5-T containing 0.5 ppm of TCDD,
groups of pregnant Wistar rats were treated by gavage on day 9 of
gestation with doses of 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg in 0.2% carboxymethyl-
cellulose. Day 9 is generally regarded as the time at which the rat
embryo is teratogenically most susceptible.
