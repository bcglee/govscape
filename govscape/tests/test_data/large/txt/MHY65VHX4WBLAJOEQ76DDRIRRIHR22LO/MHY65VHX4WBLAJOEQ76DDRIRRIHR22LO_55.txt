they did not appear to be more teratogenic when given together than
when given separately. Hamster studies with large doses of 2,4,5-T
containing no detectable or low concentrations of dioxin (0.1 and 0.5
ppm) produced significant fetal mortality but relatively few instances
(14/760 = 1.8%) of maldevelopment. Trials with high-dioxin-content
2,4,5-T (2.9 and 45 ppm) also caused appreciable fetal mortality but
moderate frequencies of anomalies (16/209 = 7.6%).
Based on these data jL_t can be concluded that: 1) doses of low-
dioxin-content 2,4,5-T and of TCDD below the level producing maternal
toxlcity were without significant effect on prenatal development,
producing little or no embryotoxicity in, rats, rabbits, hamsters, sheep,
and rhesus monkeys, and 2) these chemicals were more embryotoxic in mice,
producing a low to moderate frequency of a specific malformation, cleft
palate. The significance of the finding that TCDD in mice increased
certain anomalies of the kidney, which occurred in low frequency in
controls, can only be resolved by further investigation.
3. Human exposure during pregnancy. Reports have appeared in
the news media that the use of 2,4,5-T was associated with an increased
occurrence of congenital malformations and/or stillbirths in human beings
in Vietnam; Globe, Arizona; and Sweden.
Vietnam. Because of the increased use of several defoliating
chemicals by the United States Military in South Vietnam during the past
several years, particular concern was aroused by the reports in Viet-
namese newspapers between June 26 and July 5, 1969 of human birth defects
attributed to these chemicals. Two surveys have been undertaken to
evaluate the situation. One was conducted by Dr. R. T. Cutting, U. S.
