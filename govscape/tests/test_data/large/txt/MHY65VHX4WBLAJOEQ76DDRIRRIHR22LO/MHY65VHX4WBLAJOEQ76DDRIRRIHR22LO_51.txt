anomalies, types unspecified, was increased above the low level of
background occurrence by the 2,4,5-T containing 0,05 ppm TCDD,
but not by the 2,4,5-T containing 0.5 ppm TCDD. In general, these mice
showed a low level of teratogenicity at 100 mg/kg/day during embryogenesis,
and some embryolethality and decreased fetal weight at lesser doses.

Moore —' found no appreciable difference in teratogenic and embryolethal
potential between 2,4,5-T as free acid and its butyl, isooctyl and butyl
ether esters at approximately molar equivalent dosage in...jnice.
Mice of the NIH all-purpose albino stock were given subcutaneously
113 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T containing 0.4 ppm TCDD or 113 mg/kg/day of
a mixture containing 50% 2,4,5-T and 40% 2,4-D ("Orange") usually on
days 6 through 14 of gestation at the National Institute of Dental
Research —• . Cleft palate occurred in 9 of 141 offspring, but no
data regarding maternal toxicity and other fetal effects were reported.
In a recent study made by the Bionetics Research Laboratories,
commissioned by Hercules Incorporated, GDI mice were injected subcut-
aneously on days 6 through 15 of gestation with 100 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T
supplied by the Dow Chemical Co. and Hercules Inc. No maternal death
seems to have occurred and maternal weight gain was unaffected. Intra-
uterine mortality was not increased but mean fetal weight was slightly
reduced. The only malformation that occurred was cleft palate and its
frequency was 11.1% (27/243) with the Dow sample and 1.3% (3/235) with
the Hercules sample. Both products had<0.5 ppm TCDD.
TCDD in mice. TCDD given to mice at 0.001 or 0.003 mg/kg/day
subcutaneously on days 6 through 15 of gestation did not affect fetal
mortality, maternal weight gain, or fetal weight, but did produce low
frequencies of cleft palate in the three mouse lines used in the
