Objections to and Modification of
the Final Report and Recommendations of the
2,^,5-T Advisory Committee
The report by the 2,U,5-T Advisory Committee is basically an accurate
statement of the present state of information; however, it falls short of
being completely fair in its evaluation of the evidence on which conclusions
are based. It is true that considerable uncertainty exists about the tera-
togenic potential of 2,^,5-T (and of its impurities) especially for the
small doses at which man may make effective contact with this suostance. On
the other hand, the report is overoptimistic in assessing the implications
of data so that it may well underestimate what dangers may lurk in the
unrestricted use of 2,H,5-T. Particularly:
The data do not necessarily justify a conclusion that there is a
level at which TCDD is not teratogenic.
There is an unjustified certainty that Vietnam birth records do
not show teratogenic effects.
The report fails to consider the consequences of the (admitted)
uncertainty about the fate of TCDD in the food chain and in tissue.
The report does not weigh risk vs. benefits, as it was charged to do.
The report presumes to lecture the scientific community on the wis-
dom of instituting a "permissible residue" of substances thought
to be teratogenic.
The report is overoptimistic in believing that recommendations for
needed research will be followed by industry or by public agencies
once a decision has been rendered to restore 2,lt,5-T to unrestricted
use.
