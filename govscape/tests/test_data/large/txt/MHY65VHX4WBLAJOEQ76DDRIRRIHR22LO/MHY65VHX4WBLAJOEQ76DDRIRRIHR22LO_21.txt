plants. Even if 2,4,5-T containing 1 ppm TCDD were applied to such plants
at the rate of 2 Ib per acre, the resultant TCDD contamination would be at
2
the extremely low level of 0.224 yg per m on the exposed surface.
It is concluded from the foregoing that: 1) There is no indication
that TCDD accumulates in air, water or plants, although it fyught accumulate
in soils after heavy application of a highly contaminated sample of 2,4,5-T.
2) Direct application of 2,4,5-T containing TCDD could result in minute
quantities of the latter remaining on the surface of foliage. 3) Less
than 0.2% of TCDD in soil is known to be absorbed into plants.
