the phloem. Some 2,4,5-T is absorbed by the leaves, transported down the

stem and into the roots, and excreted by the roots into soil solution— .
Decarboxylation of 2,4,5-T has been demonstrated in a number of plant
127
species— . The varied sensitivity of different species to 2,4,5-T may be
25/
attributable in part to different rates of metabolism. Slife et al.—•
found only traces of unidentified metabolites 8 days after applying C-
carboxyl-labeled 2,4,5-T to wild or cultivated cucumber plants, both species
susceptible to 2,4,5-T. Easier and associates—'—' applied C-carboxyl-
labeled 2,4,5-T to excised blackjack oak leaves. They found no decarboxyl-
ation but did find that an average of 59% of the 2,4,5-T was broken down in-
28/
to three major unidentified metabolites in 24 hours. Morton—' reported
that 80% of 2,4,5-T applied to mesquite was metabolized in 24 hours. Fitz-
297
gerald et al.— identified 2,4,5-trichlorophenol as a common metabolic
product of 2,4,5-T in sweetgum and southern red oak but found that no 2,4,5-
03 /
trichloroanisole was formed. Morton et al.— have studied the metabolism
of various formulations of 2,4,5-T by beardgrass, little bluestem, and side-
oats gramma and observed only moderate effect of formulation and species on
the rate of metabolism. Half-life values in green tissues ranged from 1.6
to 2.9 weeks. In one experiment using radioactive 2,4,5-T ester and silver
beardgrass, little bluestem, and dallis grass, alcohol extracts of green
tissue taken 1 week after application contained no 2,4,5-T ester, 50% 2,4,5-T
acid, and 50% unknown radioactive metabolite.
Authorization to use 2,4,5-T on food crops depends on demonstrating
that no residue exists in the edible product at harvest. The following
studies illustrate the amounts of 2,4,5-T that may persist in food crops at
various intervals after treatment. When 2,4,5-T was applied to apples as a
