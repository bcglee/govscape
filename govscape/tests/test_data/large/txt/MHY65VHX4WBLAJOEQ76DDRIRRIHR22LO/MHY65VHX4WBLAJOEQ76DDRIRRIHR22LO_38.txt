Dow Chemical Co. Some information on the toxicity of TCDD is available
from a study of TCDD teratogenic effect in the rat (see Section II B,
p. 44). No evidence of clinical effect on the dams was found at doses of
0.0005 mg/kg/day, although embryotoxicity appeared in litters of females
given 0.000125 mg/kg/day. Some vaginal hemorrhage was caused by 0.002
mg/kg/day and 0.008 mg/kg/day caused pallor and debilitation.
As far as occupational exposure is concerned, it is clear that any
danger of 2,4,5-T formulations resides in their TCDD content. The primary
manifestation of industrial TCDD intoxication is chloracne, an easily
detected, in fact highly disfiguring, dermatitis. It is significant that
this condition has not been a problem in factories producing 2,4,5-T
with a low content of TCDD, nor among persons who apply the herbicide as
a part of their regular occupation. It is therefore highly unlikely
that exposure to traces of TCDD will have any effect on persons who use
2,4,5-T formulations occasionally or who merely encounter possible traces
of it in the environment.
Data are too limited for a firm conclusion but there is no evidence
to suggest that TCDD as a contaminant in 2,4,5-T is likely to be encountered
by animal or man in. sufficient dosage to cause toxic reactions.
