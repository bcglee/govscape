0.05 ppm TCDD) to which was added 0.00001, 0,00003, 0.00006, 0.000125,
0,0005, or 0.001 mg/kg/day of TCDD on days 6 through 15 of gestation.
Cleft palate occurred in ten litters, mostly in those receiving the
2,4,5-T plus 0.0005 or 0.001 mg TCDD. The frequency of offspring with
cleft palate, as well as procedural details and toxicity were not
described.
Charles River rats at the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences — received TCDD subcutaneously 0.0005 mg/kg/day on days 6
through 10 of gestation, or 0.002 mg/kg/day on days 9 and 10 or 13 and
14 of gestation. No malformations or excessive fetal mortality were
noted; but various possible kidney anomalies and several instances of
intestinal hemorrhage occurred. Thus, TCDD given to pregnant rats
caused embryolethality and occasional teratogenicity at doses below the
maternal toxic level.
2,4,5-T in mice. Mice of GDI, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains received,
subscutaneously, 50, 100, 113, 125, or 150 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T containing
<L, 0.5, or<0.05 ppm TCDD on days 6 through 15 of pregnancy at the

National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences — . No maternal
death occurred and maternal weight was depressed only in C57BL mice
at the 100 mg/kg dosage. Fetal mortality was increased only in GDI
mice at the 150 mg/kg level. Fetal weight was reduced in all three
lines of mice at dosages of 100 mg/kg and greater. Cleft palate occurred
in low but consistent frequencies in all three lines of mice at doses
of 100 mg/kg and more with all three samples of 2,4,5-T. Where sufficient
data were available, a dose-response relation for fetal mortality and
growth retardation was noted. Paradoxically the frequency of kidney
