GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
The Advisory Committee on 2,4,5-T has accepted as its primary
objective the evaluation of hazards to human reproduction of continued
use, under appropriate regulations, of the herbicide 2,4,5-T. Toward
this end it has examined all available information pertinent to a
scientific consideration of the subject.
The level of human exposure depends on rate of application of the
herbicide, balanced against the rate at which it is removed from the
environment. Current patterns of usage of 2,4,5-T and its known fate
in various compartments of the environment, including the plant and
animal foods of man, are such that any accumulation that might constitute
a hazard to any aspect of human health is highly unlikely.
Special note has been taken of the toxic contaminant TCDD. .The
limited data now available indicate that this dioxin is not as rapidly
degraded in the environment as is 2,4,5-T, but modern methods for the
manufacture of the herbicide are capable of routinely producing a
product with such a low level of contamination as to eliminate the
likelihood of human toxicity from exposure to TCDD. Manufacturing
standards must, however, be subject to continued monitoring.
Much of the general toxicity attributed to 2,4,5~T in the past
now appears to have been caused by the contaminant TCDD. The herbicide
when essentially free of this contaminant, e.g. 1 ppm, has relatively
low toxicity for all animal forms in which it has been tested.
Particular attention was given to the teratogenic potential of
