Apparently the amounts are usually quite small since only 28 of 322 water
samples taken in western states, where 2,4,5-T is widely used for brush
control, were shown to contain 2,4,5-T— in concentrations ranging from
0.01 to 0.07 ppb. In closely controlled watershed studies in Waynesville,
North Carolina, no 2,4,5-T was found in any sample of run-off from an area
one-fourth of which was treated with 2 Ib of 2,4,5-T per acre in 1968 or
18/
1969— . When one-fourth the area was treated with 4 Ib per acre some herb-
icide was found in the water after the first and second rain storms, but the
highest concentration found was 0.048 ppm in run-off water during a storm
that occurred 8 days after application of the herbicide. No 2,4,5-T was
found in the last sample collected that day or in those collected on
subsequent days.
Few data are available on the rate of disappearance of 2,4,5-T from
water. It would be expected to be adsorbed on clay particles or adsorbed by
aquatic species within a few days. The concentration of picloram, a con-
siderably more persistent herbicide than 2,4,5-T in most situations, decreased
from 0.965 ppm to 0.129 ppm in 3 weeks in a test in which it was applied at
19/
the rate of 4 Ib per acre to a pond— . All available data suggest that the
amount of 2,4,5-T entering water is quite low and that it does not remain in
the water very long.
Absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T by
plants have been extensively investigated. Most investigations have dealt
with 2,4-D, but numerous studies have involved both and it is apparent that
their behavior in plants is similar. Ready absorption of 2,4,5-T by leaves,

stems, and roots off plants is known to occur. nOnce
absorbed 2,4,5-T may either move upward in the xylem or bidirectionally in
