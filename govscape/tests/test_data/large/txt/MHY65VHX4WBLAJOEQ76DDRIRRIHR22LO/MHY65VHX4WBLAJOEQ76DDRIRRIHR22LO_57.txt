coastal, interior, and delta - the rates per 1000 livebirths of still-
birth and congenital malformation were 32.5 and 5.8, respectively, in
the capital area, and 36.7 and 2.9 in the three remaining areas. The
differences in these rates may be attributable to better maternal and
neonatal care, or to more competent or thorough examination for congenital
malformations in the capital area. (2) The rates for stillbirths de-
clined and for congenital malformations remained unchanged during this
10-year period. (3) The only differences in these rates between the
years 1960-65 and 1966-69, periods of relatively light and heavy defoliant
spraying, respectively, was a downward trend (from 36.1 to 32.0 for still-
births, and from 5.5 to 4.5 for congenital malformations). (4) There
were no consistent differences between heavily and lightly defoliant-
sprayed areas.
For the most part, however, the possibility of meaningful inter-
pretations of the results of the Army study were precluded by their
several limitations. First, it is obvious that only a fraction of the
total births that occurred during these years were included in the records
examined by the survey team. The report states that "RVN [Republic of
Vietnam] officials estimate that currently only 70% of all births are
reported to the MOH [Ministry of Health]" (emphasis added). The«New York
Times Encyclopedic Almanac for 1971 (p. 877) gives the estimated popula-
tion of South Vietnam for 1970 at 18 million and the birth rate as 35-
42 per 1000 population, which would yield between 630,000 and 750,000
27/
births in 1970 — . The last complete year for which records were
examined by the Army survey, 1969, yielded a total of 87,153 births.
Also the births that were included in the Army survey were far
