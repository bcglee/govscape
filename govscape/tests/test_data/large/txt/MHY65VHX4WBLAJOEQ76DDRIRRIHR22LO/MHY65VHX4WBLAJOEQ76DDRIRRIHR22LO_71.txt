c. All formulations to be used around the home and in
recreational areas as of present date should be limited to 0.1 ppm
of the dioxin, TCDD, and also should bear a conspicuous warning,
e.g., "This compound may be dangerous to pregnant women and animals
and its use must be such as to reduce the possibility of exposure
to an absolute minimum".
3. That existing deficiencies in information relative to possible
accumulation in the soil and possible magnification in the food chain
of the dioxin TCDD be rectified by specific research directed to this
end, with these questions to be subjected to scientific review within
three years of the present date and yearly thereafter until these
questions are resolved.
4. That additional post-registration monitoring for adverse
effects of agricultural chemicals be established, to include both
surveillance for such effects in man and domestic and wild animals, as
well as consideration of the applicability of new methodology that may
be evolved for specialized testing, e.g., for carcinogenesis,
mutagenesis or teratogenesis.
