We can only conclude that the Surgeon General was justified in feeling
that a prudent course of action must be based on the decision that exposure
to this herbicide may present an imminent hazard to women of childbearing
age. Hence, we can only recommend that the registration of 2,l|,5-T be
suspended and/or cancelled for use around the home, recreation areas, and
similar sites and on all crops intended for human consumption. However, the
use of 2,U,5-T may be permitted under certain conditions for uses in fores-
tration and rights-of-way providing:
1. That the limit be set of 0.1 ppm of contamination with 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin for all future production of 2,lj,5-T.
(However, the use of present inventories may be permitted until
used up providing the amount of contaminant in them does not
exceed .5 ppm of the dioxin TCDD.)
2. That 2,^,5-T be applied no more often than once a year at any one
site.
3. That 2,lj,5-T be applied with proper caution so that it will not
contaminate other areas where it may come into human contact.
We also recommend that this action be reviewed again when the existing
deficiencies in information relative to possible accumulation in the soil and
possible magnification in the food chain of the dioxin TCDD have been recti-
fied by specific research directed toward that end.
It is always difficult to make decisions in the face of uncertainty. The
insufficient data makes the work of the committee very difficult. The fact
that ours is the view of the minority ought to strengthen the impression that
the committee labored honestly and conscientiously to deduce the best recom-
mendations from a confused aggregate of observations.
