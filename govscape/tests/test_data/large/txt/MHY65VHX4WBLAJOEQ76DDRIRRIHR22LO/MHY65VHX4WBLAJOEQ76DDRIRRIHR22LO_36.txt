no injury was detected in workers with the highest recorded, prolonged
exposure in a factory making low-dioxin 2,4,5-T, i.e., 8.1 mg/man/day
or about 0.11 mg/kg/day°/. In view of the small and highly infrequent
occurrence of residues of 2,4,5-T in human food (see Section IB), it
is clear that exposure from this source is too small to measure
accurately. Thus, although it is impossible to estimate how much
greater the 2,4,5-T exposure of workers is than the exposure of the
general population, it is clearly much greater than the corresponding one
for DDT—. In fact, exposure to 2,4,5-T is trivial even for persons
who daily eat unpolished rice.
The very small number of cases in which human irigestion of 2,4,5-T
led to clinical illness offer no information on the minimal dosage of
the compound that is toxic to man. In animals, however, the toxicity
of 2,4,5-T is similar to that of 2,4-D, consequently some information
on 2,4-D is of interest. When 2,4-D was investigated as a possible
treatment for disseminated coccidiodomycosis, the patient had no side-
effects from 18 intravenous doses during 33 days; each of the last 12
doses in this series was 800 mg (about 15 mg/kg) or more, the last
being 2000 mg (about 37 mg/kg). A 19th and final dose of 3600 mg
(67 mg/kg) produced mild symptoms—/. Suicidal ingestion of a
quantity of 2,4-D as a single dose known to be greater than 6500 mg

(in excess of 90 mg/kg) was fatal— •
Butler —' —' has reviewed Fish and Wildlife Service studies of
pesticide and herbicide effects on marine organisms. Several 2,4,5-T
derivatives were examined (TCDD content was not known). A 96-hour
exposure of oysters to the polyglycol butyl ether esters of 2,4,5-T at
a concentration of 0.14 ppm in the water caused a 50% decrease in shell
