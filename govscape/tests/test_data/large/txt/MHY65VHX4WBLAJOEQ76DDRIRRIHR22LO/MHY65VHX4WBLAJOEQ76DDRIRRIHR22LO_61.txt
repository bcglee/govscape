of the apparent sudden rise in prevalence of these two malformations is
more thorough examination and increased referral for surgical repair.
Supporting this probability is the fact, noted by the Army Report, that
the frequency of congenital malformations recorded in the capital area
hospitals was much higher (although it varied greatly among the three
hospitals) than in the remainder of the country, a fact in turn attribut-
able to availability of more complete and competent medical services and
personnel in the former than in the latter. •
Summarizing the Vietnam data on human embryotoxicity, it can be
said that (1) the sample of births surveyed was from year to year a
variable but usually very small fraction of the total number, (2) it
was quite unrepresentative of the geographic and ethnic distributions,
(3) the heavily sprayed and otherwise exposed areas were greatly under-
represented, and (4) the birth records were not trustworthy and, there-
fore, the rates of stillbirth, and especially of congenital malformation,
derived from them were equally unreliable. For example, the overall
congenital malformation rate found in South Vietnam, 4.91 per 1000 live-
births, is about half of what was reported in other studies in various
24/
parts of Asia — , and possibly a quarter of what might actually exist at
term. A further indication that the newborn children were not carefully
examined is tlie absence of Down's syndrome in the list of specific mal-
formations compiled by the Army survey, despite the fact- that some Oriental
populations have been reported to have an incidence of this condition not
28/
unlike that in Western populations — .
Finally there is, and can be, no precise knowledge or reasonable
approximation of the exposure to 2,4,5-T experienced by pregnant
