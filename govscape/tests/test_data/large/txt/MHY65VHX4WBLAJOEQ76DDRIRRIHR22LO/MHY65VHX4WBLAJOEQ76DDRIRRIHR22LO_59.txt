HAC report, this was heavily influenced by data from the capital area,
in which 67.8% of all the surveyed livebirths occurred, and which
generally experienced little or no exposure to 2,4,5-T. Deducting the
capital area data and considering only data from the other parts of
the country apparently reverses the trend, giving stillbirth and
malformation rates for 1960-65 (years of no or light spraying) and
1966-69 (years of heavy spraying) of 31.9 and 2.3, and 38.4 and 3.1,
respectively. This would seem to indicate that in the remoter areas,
where exposure could have been intense, stillbirth and malformation
rates increased during years when spraying was heavy. A possible
explanation for these apparent differences was provided by the HAC
report, in noting that more complete recording and increased referral
of difficult pregnancies from the countryside to the provincial hospitals
occurred in these years. A more likely explanation, however, is that
in recent years, as a larger and larger proportion of births was
registered (e.g., number recorded in noncapital areas in 1960-65 was
37,951; in 1966-69, 113,358) a larger proportion of stillbirths was
ascertained and a more complete examination for and/or recording of
congenital malformations was made.
Particular attention was directed by the HAC reports &o the records
for the Tay Ninh Provincial Hospital, because although "the total number
of directly exposed Vietnamese to 2,4,5-T is* probably low, the northern
portion of Tay Ninh has been heavily defoliated and the rivers draining
the areas of defoliation run through the remainder of the province and
are a source of fish for some of the population." Examining records
that were apparently not available to the. Army survey, the HAC found that
