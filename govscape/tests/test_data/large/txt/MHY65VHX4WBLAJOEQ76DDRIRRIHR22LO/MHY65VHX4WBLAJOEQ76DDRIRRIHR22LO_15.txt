injury to crops is now unusual. The elimination of drift sufficient to
injure most crop plants, however, does not eliminate the possibility of
drift that can be detected chemically.
Some of the 2,4,5-T applied as spray can be transported in the
atmosphere as droplets of spray, as the gaseous phase of 2,4,5-T, or
adsorbed on dust or other particulate matter in the air. In a survey in
the State of Washington, 2,4,5-T was detected 9 days out of 99 at Pullman,
o
in average concentration in positive samples of 0.045 yg/m . At Kennewick
it was found 14 days out of 102 at average concentration in positive samples
3 147
of 0.012 yg/m — . In Cincinnati, Ohio, 0.04 ppm was found adsorbed on
dust in a trace of rain—' presumably from applications in Texas. Photo-
chemical degradation would be expected to occur in the air, particularly at
high altitudes and in dry climates where ultraviolet radiation is highest.
Kearney et al.—' report that exposure of 5 and 10 ppm water solutions of
2,4,5-T to ultraviolet light from a 450 watt Hanovia lamp greatly reduced
the 2,4,5-T present within 5 minutes. It is not possible to extrapolate
accurately from these data to the rate of decomposition in sunlight, but
it is obvious that photochemical degradation could play a significant role.
Probably most of the 2,4,5-T that gets into the air very soon either settles
out or is washed out by rain and thereby is returned to soil and water.
There is no evidence to suggest that 2,4,5-T remains in the air for more
than a few weeks after insertion.
Measurable quantities of 2,4,5-T could enter water iL'n several ways,
e.g., by inadvertent direct spraying, from surface leaching of treated
soils and plants, or in rain that falls through air containing 2,4,5-T;
but undoubtedly most of it is washed from treated plants and soil.
