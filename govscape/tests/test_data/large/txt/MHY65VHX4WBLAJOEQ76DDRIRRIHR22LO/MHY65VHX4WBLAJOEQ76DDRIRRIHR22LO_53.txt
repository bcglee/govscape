The most frequent defects, poorly characterized as "bulging eyes" and
"poor head fusion", occurred in low percentage (15.8% and 11.4%, respect-
ively) after 2,4,5-T with or without TCDD. Some apparent discrepancies
were present in the calculations of the malformation rates. In addition
150 mg/kg/day of a recrystalized and extracted 2,4,5-T was used 22J and
produced a high fetal mortality rate but no malformations.
TCDD in hamsters. Hamsters were given dioxin (21% tri, 53%
tetra CDD) orally at 0.00013, 0.002 or 0.0091 mg/kg/day on days 6
oo/
through 10 of gestation at the Food and Drug Administration — . Maternal
toxicity was not mentioned. Mean fetal weight was reduced only at the
two highest dosages. Eye anomalies and prenatal mortality were most
frequent at the highest dose. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage was noted at
the 0.0005 and 0.002 mg/kg doses.
2,4,5-T in rabbits. New Zealand white rabbits were treated orally
with 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T containing 1 ppm TCDD on days
6 through 18 of gestation at Dow Chemical Co. — —'• No deaths of
pregnant females occurred, and maternal weight gain and fetal mortality
and weight were unaffected. No congenital malformations were noted and
developmental variations were not increased in frequency.
2,4,5-T in sheep. Sheep were fed 100 mg/kg/day of Dow production
2,4,5-T or of Dow production 2,4,5-T propyleneglycolbutylether ester on
days 14 through 36 of pregnancy at the Department of Agriculture Animal
9/
Disease and Parasite Research Division ~ . Two of 19 ewes died on days
35 and 36 of pregnancy, but their fetuses were normal. The other 17
delivered normal offspring at term. No further details were provided.
