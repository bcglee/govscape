II. TOXICITY OF 2,4,5-T AND TCDD IN ANIMALS AND MAN
Currently available commercial preparations of 2,4,5-T can be
characterized as having at least 95% 2,4,5-T with less than 0.5 ppm
TCDD and no other toxicologically significant compound. Many earlier
studies on the adverse effects of 2,4,5-T employed preparations
containing considerably greater concentrations of TCDD than this, and
others used 2,4,5-T samples of unspecified purity. Toxicological
studies utilizing 2,4,5-T preparations which were not known to conform
to the standards suggested above, nevertheless, have some value because
any error attributable to larger amounts of TCDD would have been toward
the conservative side, that is, would have suggested greater toxicity
than if a purer 2,4,5-T had been used.
A. Nonteratogenic Toxicity.
Of 2,4,5-T. Among the earlier reports of 2,4,5-T toxicity that
did not fully identify the composition of the product under
investigation were the studies of Drill and Hiratzka— in which oral
LD Q for dogs was estimated to be in excess of 100 rag/kg, and of Rowe

2/
and Hymas— in which the oral LD,- to various rodents was found to be
n
greater than 350 mg/kg. Drill and Hiratzka found no adverse effects in
dogs which were fed 2,4,5-T five times a week for 90 days at dosage
levels of 2.5 and 10 mg/kg. Four dogs were treated at a level of 20
mg/kg 2,4,5-T and died at 11, 49, 59 and 75 days after the first dose,
Rowe and Hymas reviewed the toxicologic information available on 2,4,5-T
at that time, and concluded that the acute lethal oral toxicity, in terms
