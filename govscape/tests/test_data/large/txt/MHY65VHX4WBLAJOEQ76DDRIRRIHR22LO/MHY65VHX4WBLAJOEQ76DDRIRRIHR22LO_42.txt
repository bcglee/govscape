such as endemic cretinism, diabetes, phenylketonuria, and adrenal hyper-
plasia account for a small percentage of human developmental disease. One
environmental pollutant, methylmercury, proved to be teratogenic for man
when it reacned high concentrations in certain watet in Japan from which
fish were eaten as a large part of the diet.
Adverse effects on development are difficult to evaluate because
they vary greatly in degree and type. Collectively these effects can
be designated as embryotoxic because they most often have their inception
in the embryo and include such manifestations of toxicity as lethality,
teratogenicity, prenatal growth retardation, and postnatal functional
deficiencies. Few attempts are made to evaluate functional deficiency
except as it may be reflected in postnatal survival data. On the other
hand embryolethality, teratogenicity, and growth retardation can under
laboratory conditions be readily detected and quantitated. Difficulty
is often encountered, however, when all three toxic manifestations are
simultaneously evaluated, since the phenomena involved are rarely
affected to the same degree by a given embryotoxic agent. Although most
chemical substances probably could be shown to be teratogenic under
suitable experimental conditions and all could be shown to have some toxic
effects when dosage is sufficiently high, some would be more strongly
teratogenic, others would be predominantly embryolethal, whereas still
others would tend mainly to cause intrauterine growth retardation.
While these toxic manifestations vary directly with dosage, they may not
show parallel dose-response effects. Any one of the three may begin to
appear at a somewhat lower dose than either of the others. Lethality is
probably the most variable from one agent to another, sometimes appearing
at low doses and increasing slowly as dosage is increased, sometimes
