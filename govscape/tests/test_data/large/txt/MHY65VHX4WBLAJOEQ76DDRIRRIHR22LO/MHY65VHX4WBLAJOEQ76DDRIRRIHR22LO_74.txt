It Is Hot _Quite Certain .at What Dpje TCDD Has Mo Effect

The report gives the impression that 2,^,5-T shows a teratogerxic
effect uniformly at high doses only. One reason for that impression is
that most investigations concentrate on doses of 100 mg/kg or more so that
data are lacking to a large extent on how much of teratogenic effects could
show up at smaller doses. Yet, there are a number of studies that do show
definite effects for doses of less than 100 mg/kg of weight.* Also, the
dose effect of 2,H,5-T depends largely on its impurities, especially on
TCDD. The experiments which provide the basic animal data and the analysis
of these data unfortunately were not done with the sophistication necessary
to throw light on the effect of 2,H,5-T and TCDD at very low doses. Many
of the reports presented no more than tables of group means, and some even
presented pages and pages of undigested numbers on individual observations.
It is difficult to draw any final and firm conclusion from data such as
these. Nevertheless, there are sufficient instances where teratogenic
