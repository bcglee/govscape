I. FACTORS INFLUENCING EXPOSURE TO MAN,
Human exposure to an environmental chemical such as 2,4,5-T
depends on 1) pattern of usage, i.e., how widely and frequently
applied and in what amounts, and 2) its fate in the environment, i.e.,
does it accumulate or is it degraded as fast as applied.
A. Patterns of use.
The chloro-phenoxy herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been widely
used to control broad-leaved weeds for over 20 years. Because 2,4,5-T
is more expensive than 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) it has
been primarily used to control woody plants and a few herbaceous
species against which it is more effective than 2,4-D, and because of
the cost difference, commercial formulations containing 2,4,5-T are
usually mixtures of the two herbicides. In 1964 the uses of 2,4,5-T
were: rights-of-way - 49%, non-farm forests - 10%, hay, pasture, and
rangelands - 7%, all other farm uses - 12%, lawns and turf - 7%,
federal agencies - 6%, and other miscellaneous uses - 9%.â€”' The tocal
domestic use at that time was about 9 million pounds and incomplete
information indicates that this value may also be approximately correct
for 1969.-/
Most of the 2,4,5-T used is applied as a spray to foliage.
Lesser amounts are sprayed on the trunks and branches of dormant trees,
injected into the bases of trees, poured or sprayed into frills around
the trunks of trees, or sprayed or painted on newly cut stumps of trees.
Amine salts of 2,4,5-T dissolved in water are most often used when the
herbicide is applied to foliage and esters dissolved in oil are most
