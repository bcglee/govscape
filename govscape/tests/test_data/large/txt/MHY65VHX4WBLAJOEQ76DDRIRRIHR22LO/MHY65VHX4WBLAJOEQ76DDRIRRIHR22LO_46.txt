frequency of delayed ossification of skull bones. The larger dose
produced 83% maternal death and early death (resorption) of the entire
litters in most of the surviving pregnant animals. Surviving offspring
were reduced in size but had no anomalies except delayed ossification of
skull bones, and this retardation was overcome within three weeks after
birth,
Sprague-Dawley rats at the National Institute of Dental Research —' —'
were given orally 60, 80, 100, or 120 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T containing 0.4 ppm
TCDD over various periods of consecutive days during the middle third of
gestation. Maternal toxicity data were not reported. No treatment greatly
increased the intrauterine mortality rate and many had no effect. Prenatal
growth retardation was not mentioned, Apparently the offspring were
examined only for external malformations and those of the oral cavity.
Very few with such defects were found (7 of 1500 from females treated
at susceptible periods). A mixture of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D produced one case
of cleft palate. To rule out the possibility that the chemical might
not be reaching the fetus, millipore filters soaked with 0.05, 0.1, 0.11,
or 0.125 mg 2,4,5-T were applied to amniotic sacs on day 12, 13, 14, 15, or
16 of gestation. Of 68 fetuses surviving to the time of examination two
had cleft palate, one had a tail defect, four had limb defects, and others
were small or edematous. A second study of this type yeilded one possible
limb defect and four possible tail defects in 68 survivors.
Rats of the FW-49 stock in Germany recently were given 25, 50, 100,
or 150 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T (containing <C0.02 ppm TCDD) on days 6
12/
through 15 of gestation (cited by Tschirley — • ). Macro-and Microscopic
examination revealed no signs of teratogenicity even with the highest
