C. Fate in Animals
Fate of 2,4,5-T. Information on absorption, distribution, and
metabolism of 2,4,5-T is not extensive. The most thorough studies are
1/2/
those reported by Erne —— who demonstrated that the triethanolamine
and alkaline salts of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D were readily absorbed, distri-
buted and eliminated from the body. Rats and pigs given single doses of
100 mg/kg of the amine salt showed plasma half-life values of 3 and 10
hours respectively. Residues in kidney, liver, lungs and spleen some-
times exceeded plasma levels, but there was little indication of penetra-
tion into brain or adipose tissues. The compounds were excreted mainly
via the kidney. With repeated administration plasma levels decreased and
excretion rates increased. Up to 20% of the material in blood was in
erythrocytes. As with single doses, little was found in adipose tissue or
in the central nervous system. Placental transfer was found to be rapid
in swine. Tissue half-times ranged from 5 to 30 hours and,were lowest in
rats. There was no apparent retention of either 2,4-D or of; 2,4,5-T after
repeated administration.

According to St. John et al.,— when a cow was given 450 mg of
2,4,5-T acid divided among four daily doses, all of the administered
material was excreted in the urine as the salt within 6 days. Zlelinski
and Fishbein- found that a dose of 100 mg/kg of 2,4,5-T in mice was lost
from the body more slowly than were several other herbicides, with disappear-
ance rates ranging between 1 and 4% of the original dose per hour.
The rate of excretion of 2,4,5-T in man is unknown, but it seems to
be slower than that of 2,4-D. A man who committed suicide with a mixture
of the two compounds had substantial concentrations of 2,4,5-T in all
organs analyzed but no 2,4-D in any organ?-'.
