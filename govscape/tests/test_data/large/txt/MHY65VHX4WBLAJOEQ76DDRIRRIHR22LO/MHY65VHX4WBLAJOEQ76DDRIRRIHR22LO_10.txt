2,4,5-T. The necessity of making a value judgment of benefit vs. risk,
therefore, must be accepted, not only for this herbicide, but for numerous
valuable drugs, some natural nutrients, and many other chemicals, some of
which are known to be teratogenic in laboratory animals. The risk vs.
benefit judgment for a particular herbicide or drug can be evaded only if
it can be shown that another compound is equally as efficient and involves
less risk. This presupposes that the risk potential of a substitute herb-
icide is at least as well known as that of the original (in this case
2,4,5-T), a fact that may be difficult or impossible to ascertain. The
substitution of a relatively unknown pesticide for an older one with known
adverse effects is not a step to be taken lightly. Even with steadily
improving methods for safety evaluation of new chemicals it is impossible
to anticipate all of the conditions and permutations of use that could
result in undesirable effects.
The task of making a judgment about the central question of hazard
to human pregnancy is complicated by still other considerations. Although
herbicides are of economic benefit to man, their use is not without possible
hazard to the environment and to other aspects of human welfare. In various
connections questions have been raised about: 1) damage to non-target
plants caused by spray drift or by movement in water, 2) damage to sub-
sequently planted sensitive crops owing to herbicide persistence in the soil,
and 3) acute or chronic toxicity to man or other animals aside from that
related to pregnancy. In addition, there is some concern that traces of the
chemical or its contaminants in food may cause unsuspected effects in man or
that minute amounts in the environment >may -adversely affect untested species
in the ecosystem.
