tolerated dose (zero mortality) determined with single doses, 6 daily
doses, and finally 19 daily doses. The dosage was given by stomach
tube at 21.5 rag/kg from the end of the first through the fourth weeks
and thereafter it was mixed in the diet at 60 ppm of food and continued
until 18 months of age. It is presumed that all animals survived the
18 month test period although this was not stated in the publication.
Johnson— has reported acute oral, single dose toxicity studies
on commercial 2,4,5-T in which the LD5Q for 2,4,5-T was 500 mg/kg in the
rat and 380 mg/kg in the guinea pig. Ninety-day feeding studies with
2,4,5-T containing 0,5 ppm TCDD were recently reported by McCollister
and Kociba.— The acid form was administered to groups of 10 male and
10 female rats at 100, 30, 103 and 0 mg/kg/day. No significant adverse
effects were observed in the groups receiving doses at or below 30
mg/kg/day, but those receiving 100 mg/kg/day showed a depression of
body weight gain, a decrease in food intake and elevated alkaline
phosphatase levels. The males showed slightly increased serum
.glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels and slight decreases in red blood
cell counts and hemoglobin levels. Histological evidence of toxicity
were minor and inconsistant. In an earlier experiment at Dow Chemical Co.—',
the mono-, di-, and tripropylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2,4,5-T
were administered orally to rats over a similar 90-day period at doses
as high as 186 mg of 2,4,5-T acid equivalent per kg per day. At the
highest dose and at 62 mg/kg/day of acid equivalent various evidences of
toxicity developed, but no adverse manifestations attributable to the
agent were detected at dosages of 18.6 or 6.2 mg/kg/day.
