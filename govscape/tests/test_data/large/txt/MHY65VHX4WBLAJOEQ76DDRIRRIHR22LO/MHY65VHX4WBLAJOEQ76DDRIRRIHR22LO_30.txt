3) 2,4,5-T has been detected in animal tissues or products used for human
food very infrequently and then only in minute quantities; 4) limited data
indicate that TCDD is also eliminated, at least some by metabolic breakdown,
with a half-life of 20 days; and 5) the solubility of TCDD in fat is limited
which would preclude appreciable accumulation in body fat.
