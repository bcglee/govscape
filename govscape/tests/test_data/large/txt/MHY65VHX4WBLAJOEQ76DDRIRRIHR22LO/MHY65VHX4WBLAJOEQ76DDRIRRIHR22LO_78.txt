We find it difficult to go along with this reasoning. After recent
experience with DDT and with mercury, it would be reckless to leave such
questions in abeyance while approving the unrestricted use of 2,U,5-T.
Nothing would be lost by waiting two or three years while this question
can be settled. On the other hand, a great deal of damage may be created
if the committee restores 2,H,5-T to its normal use while hoping that further
research will justify our confidence in having made a correct guess. More-
over, the restriction of 2,^,5-T from regular use would work as a powerful
motive, spurring industry and concerned government agencies to seek to settle
this important question by initiating appropriate studies. Yet, at the same
time, the use of 2,lf,5-T could be maintained in all those instances where
contamination of food or people would be unlikely.
Considering the Risk/Benefit Equation
A curious situation emerges in evaluating the benefit of 2,^,5-T. It
is apparently of major value in its nonfarm uses, especially for forestry
and road clearance, where it can be applied sparingly and with a great deal
of expertise. Also, in forestration 2,U,5-T may be reapplied only every
few years. The other uses in or near food crops and around the home repre-
sent less frequent areas of application but may expose very large numbers of
individuals to 2,^,5-T, to its impurities, and to its residues. Thus, it
is not true that all uses of 2,lt,5-T are equivalently beneficial.
Many of the nonfarm uses of 2,1*,5~T clearly have national benefit. On
the other hand, the use of 2,H,5-T for the growing of crops, especially
rice, is basically of benefit to a few farm industries because it increases
the yield per acre of cultivated ground. Since there are available many
acres that are not now cultivated, there does not appear to be a national
