dosages. There was an increase in the prenatal mortality beginning at
the 50 mg/kg dose and a reduction in the mean fetal weight beginning at
the 100 mg/kg dose. Complete details of the study were not given.
Charles River rats at the National Institute of Environmental Health

Sciences — — — received samples of 2,4,5-T CO.5 and 30 ppm TCDD) at
the rate of 10 to 80 mg/kg/day orally or subcutaneously on days 6 through
15 of gestation, or 2,4,5-T C^ 0.05 ppm TCDD) at the rate of 150 mg/kg/day
subcutaneously on days 14 and 15 of gestation. The 80 mg/kg dose was
stated to be the maternal LD, dose but data were not presented. The
80 and 150 mg/kg doses caused a reduction in maternal weight gain and
increased prenatal mortality, but fetal weight was unaffected. A low
incidence of fetal kidney anomalies was noted, but could not be attributed
with .confidence to the treatment. In addition, pregnant females were
fed 50 mg/kg of 2,4,5-T (< 0.05 ppm TCDD) and allowed to deliver. The
offspring examined periodically for 3 weeks postnatally during which
time mortality, weight gain, and general development did not differ from
those of control animals,
Wistar rats at the Food and Drug Directorate of Canada ~ were
fed dosages of 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T acid or of
2,4,5-T butyl ester containing <0.5 ppm TCDD on days 6 through 15 of
gestation. No apparent adverse effects on pregnant females were noted,
but fetal weight was reduced. At the largest dosage there was an
apparent increase in the frequency of "spontaneously occurring" skeletal
anomalies. The largest dose of the acid form killed 3 of 8 pregnant
females and reduced maternal weight gain but lower do'ses were without
maternal toxicity. Intrauterine death was increased at 50 mg/kg and
was pronounced at larger dosages, at which levels weight of surviving
