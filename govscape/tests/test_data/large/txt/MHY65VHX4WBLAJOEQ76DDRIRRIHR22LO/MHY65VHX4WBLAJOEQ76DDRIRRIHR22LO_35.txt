of inhaled 2,4,5-T. The inhalation rate of the agent was estimated to
be 1.6 to 8.1 rag/day per worker, depending on the work assignment, for
periods of up to three years and at total career exposures in excess
of 10,000 mg. The survey indicates that no illness was associated with
2,4,5-T intake. Specifically there was no increase in skin ailments
or of alkaline phosphatase or SGPT levels as compared with controls
having no exposure to 2,4,5-T.
The result was entirely different in a plant where the 2,4,5-T
produced contained a high proportion of dioxin. The latter plant was
9/
studied by Bleiberg— in 1964 and again six years later by Poland
et al.— who also reviewed earlier studies in factories in other
countries where TCDD had been a problem. Poland and associates
reported on 73 employees whose health was found to be improved
compared to that of workers in the plant six years earlier. Eighteen
percent of the men had suffered moderate to severe chloracne, the
intensity of which correlated significantly with the presence of
residual hyperpigmentation, hirsutism, and eye irritation and with a
high score on a test indicating a manic reaction. The chloracne did not
correlate with job location or duration of employment at the plant or with
coproporphrin excretion. One of the men had uroporphyrinuria but,
unlike the situation six years earlier, no porphyria could be found.
Systemic illness such as may be produced by TCDD was markedly less
than that reported in previous studies of 2,4,5-T plants and probably no
greater than expected in unexposed men of the same age.
Dogs and rats tolerate oral intake of 2,4,5-T at a rate of 10
mg/kg/day or higher without detectable clinical, biochemical, or
pathological change. The tolerance limit of people is not known but
