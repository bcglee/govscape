RECOMMENDATIONS
The Advisory Committee on 2,4,5-T after careful consideration of
available information on potential hazards to man, -particularly as
regards reproductive functions, of continued, regulated use of 2,4,5-T,
recommends the following:
1. That registration for use of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid
and its esters be restored to the status existing prior to April 1970,
with the following exceptions.
2. That certain specific limitations and qualifications be added
to the previously existing registration, as follows:
a. A permissible residue or not more than 0.1 ppm of 2,4,5-T
on the edible parts of food products and in potable water for human
consumption be accepted. It is recognized that very few foods
tested to date have contained this level of residue, but it is
probable that some of the reports of no residue in the past were
due to limited sensitivity of the analytical method. In view of
recent and future advances in methodology, which tend to make zero
residues of anything increasingly unlikely, a more realistic
policy would be the setting of safe tolerance limits at this time.
b. A limit of 0.5 ppm of contamination with 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin be set for existing inventories of
2,4,5-T, except as specified in item c. below, and a limit of 0.1
ppm of contamination with this dioxin be established in all future
production of 2,4,5-T. Surveillance should be maintained by
requiring that a manufacturer submit a reference sample and a
certified analysis of each future production lot to the Environmental
Protection Agency.
