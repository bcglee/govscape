and how stillbirth rates compare between regions that are heavily defoliated
and regions that are not. The Army survey notes that during 1966 to 1969
there was a countrywide downward trend in the stillbirth rate. But the HAC
report points out that this conclusion was heavily influenced by data from
the capitol area in which 67.8 per cent of all live births surveyed occurred
and which, in addition, generally experienced little or no exposure to
2,1*,5-T. Deducting the capitol area data and considering only that from other
parts of the country, reverses the trend and results in lower stillbirth
and malformation rates for 1960-65 (years of no or light spray) than for
1966-69 (years of heavy spraying). Also, HAC found that the 1968-69
stillbirth rates recorded at Tay Ninh City Provincial Hospital, a hospital
which was in a region heavily defoliated and through which rivers draining
areas of defoliation run, had a recorded stillbirth rate of 68.5, which they
believe to be higher than that found anywhere else.
The 2,U,5-T Advisory Committee report goes into the unreliability of
all the human data that comes from Vietnam in great detail. It is true
that the instances cited might easily have created a spurious impression of
an increased stillbirth rate for the defoliated regions or periods. However,
the opposite might be just as true. Factors could just as easily have worked
to hide a large stillbirth rate than to spuriously create one. If we
already speculate, we might just as easily speculate the other way. Thus,
the best we can say is that these data do not definitely show an effect of
defoliation. However, they do show an effect which has to be explained away.
It is up to the committee to register our doubts, but it is unseemly to
spend page after page denying the reality of the Vietnam observation in the
face of the careful report by a select committee of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
