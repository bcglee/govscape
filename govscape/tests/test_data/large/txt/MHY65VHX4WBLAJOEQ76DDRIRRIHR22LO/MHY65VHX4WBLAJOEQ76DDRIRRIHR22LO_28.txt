Using massive doses it is possible experimentally to exceed the
ability of domestic animals to eliminate 2,4,5-T and thereby to produce
measurable residues in their tissues. Four or more 250 mg doses of
2,4,5-T given to sheep produced levels of 33 to 113 ppm in fat and
40 to 100 ppm in muscle. The residues were 99% or more in the acid
form regardless of whether the acid form or an ester was fed SJ. The
Chemical form of the agent, however, may influence its deposition.
Oral administration of the propylene glycol or butyl ether esters of
2,4,5-T to yearling cattle for 32 weeks at rates of 0.15 and 0.75
mg/kg/day produced no residues greater than those occasionally found
in untreated controls. Subsequently Clark et al., — fed 2,4,5-T,
2,4-D and Silvex (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy propionic acid) to sheep and
cattle at several dietary concentrations for 28 days. Sheep receiving
2000 ppm 2,4,5-T in the diet were found to have muscle tissue residues
of 1.0 ppm when treatment was terminated, and no detectable residue
o /
7 days later. Newton and Norris —' analyzed tissues from deer that
had ranged over reforested land treated with 2,4,5-T and found essentially
no residues.
Several factors limit the intake of 2,4,5-T by domestic animals
and man following recommended use of the compound, namely, low rate of
application and breakdown by plants, animals, photochemical degradation
and soil microorganisms. Owing to both the limited nature of prescribed
use and the decomposition that occurs in the environment, 2,4,5-T almost
never reaches a detectable level in human drinking water or food (see
Section I B, pp. 11 and 14). Examination of approximately 11,600 samples
of food offered for retail sale in the United States revealed only five
