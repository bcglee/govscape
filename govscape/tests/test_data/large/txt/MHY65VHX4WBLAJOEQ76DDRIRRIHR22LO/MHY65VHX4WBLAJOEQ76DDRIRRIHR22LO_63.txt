medical and agricultural experts have been unable to find evidence of
adverse effects on either human or animal reproduction that could be
attributed to the defoliants applied during the Kellner Canyon-Russell
Gulch spray project.
Swedish Lapland. Swedish government defoliation projects to
improve the quality of forests in Lapland have been associated in the
public press with the occurrence of human malformations and abortion
among reindeer. The chlorophenoxy acids 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T were used in
routine fashion for a number of years without reports of untoward
effects until the spring of 1970 when several instances of unexplained
death and abortion among reindeer were attributed to use of these
compounds. A group of scientific experts has investigated these claims
30 /
for the National Poisons and Pesticides Board â€” and has failed to
find a substantial basis for relating the toxic manifestations in these
animals to ingestion of herbicides. Subsequently two instances of con-
genital malformations in human infants have been attributed to alleged
exposure of pregnant women during application of the herbicides. Highly
competent medical scientists at the Institute of Hygiene and the
Teratological Laboratories of the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm and
at the Institute of Human Genetics at Mllnster, Germany have beeh unable
to find temporal or clinical evidence to suggest that the occurrence of
these human birth defects was more than coincidentally related to defol-
iating operations in Sweden.
