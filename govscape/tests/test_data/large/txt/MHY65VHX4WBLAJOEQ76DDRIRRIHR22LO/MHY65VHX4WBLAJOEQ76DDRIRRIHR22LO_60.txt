in 1968-69 the stillbirth rate recorded at the Tay Ninh City Provincial
Hospital was 68.5, which they believed to be a higher rate than that
found anywhere else by the Army survey. Although this is true, it should
be noted that in two provincial hospitals, Qui Nhon, for which records
only for 1966-69 were available, and Da Lat (nonpaying patients) during
1960-65, the stillbirth rates were not far below this, being 62.7 and
61.4, respectively.
The HAG also discovered how unreliable the records were regarding
congenital malformations, since they noted that not a single malformation
was recorded for the 2551 births in 1969 in the Tay Ninh Provincial
Hospital, and on questioning the midwives it was learned that although
a fair number of deformities had been seen none were reported. Another
hospital, at Vung Tau, during most of 1968-70 reported no congenital
malformations in 6198 births and a much lower stillbirth rate than did
the Tay Ninh Hospital, yet it closely bordered and included in its
referral area a zone of intense defoliation.
A further point needing critical scrutiny is the finding by the
HAG of an apparent increased prevalence of children with spina bifida
and isolated cleft palate among admissions to the Saigon Children's
Hospital, the former increasing from 0.7% in 1959-66 to 2.1% in 1967-68,
and the latter from 0.5% in 1959-65 to 2.6% in 1966-68. It should be
emphasized that the figures do not pertain to- incidence at birth, but to
the percentage of malformed children admitted to this Hospital some time
after birth for operative care. It should also be stated that at least
77.5% of all the admissions in 1959-69 came from Saigon or nearby areas
in which defoliation was not practiced. Again the most lilcely explanation
