often used when it is applied to bark. The spray concentrations
usually vary between 0.1 and 2.5% and the rates of application are
usually between 0.5 and 8 Ib per acre, depending on the size, and
sensitivity of the plants being treated. Higher rates and concentra-
tions have been used in Vietnam for military purposes.
On domestic rice, 0.50 to 1.25 Ib per acre of 2,4,5-T is used in
3/
5 to 7 gal of water—' , applied from the air when the rice is 7 to 9
weeks old, has emerged from the water, and is'standing erect.
Directions for the use of 2,4,5-T warn against allowing it to drift
onto susceptible plant species and require that the herbicide not be
allowed to contaminate water used for irrigation or domestic purposes.
B. Fate in soil, air, water and plants.
When 2i4,5-T is applied as a spray, the great bulk of the herbicide
and any contaminant it may contain, e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo--
paradioxin (TCDD), are deposited on the foliage of the plants, on the
ground in the immediate vicinity or, in the case of rice, on the
impounded water. Much smaller amounts may be inserted into the air or
settle on streams of water and by either means be carried many miles
from the site of appl'ication. After 2,4,5-T and TCDD are applied,
however, each moves through the biosphere and accumulates or degrades
according to its own chemical and physical properties. The fate of
2,4,5-T has been more extensively studied than that of TCDD.
Fate of 2,4,5-T. Once the herbicide reaches the soil it is
immediately subjected to physical and chemical actions that continually
reduce the amount remaining at the site of application. These actions
include degradation by soil microorganisms, leaching and surface
