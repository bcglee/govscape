growth rate, with recovery in one week. The 24-hour LD^Q of this ester
to juvenile esta"3<jine fish was 0.32 ppm. A concentration of 2,4,5-T
acid at 2 ppm caused no decrease in growth after 96 hours. A level of
50 ppm 2,4,5-T was not lethal to juvenile mullet and killifish in 48
hours, and 1 ppm was without effect on shrimp in 48 hours. It is thus
apparent that aquatic species tolerate higher concentrations of 2,4,5-T
than have been reported in water samples taken from heavily sprayed
areas (see Section I B, pp. 11-12).
It is concluded from the foregoing that: 1) most species tested
can survive a single oral dose in excess of 100 mg/kg and several,
excepting the dog, can survive daily treatment for a number of days at
this level or higher; 2) dogs die after 11 to 75 doses at the rate of
20 mg/kg/day and rats show toxic signs at repeated daily doses of
100 mg/kg; both species tolerate 10 mg/kg/day without detectable
effect; 3) no proven instance of toxicity associated with 2,4,5-T
intake in man has been found in industrial or agricultural workers
known to have had repeated, relatively high levels of exposure to
2,4,5-T of low dioxin content; and 4) the safety factor for the general
population is estimated to be several orders of magnitude greater than
that of 2,4,5-T factory workers.
Of TCDD. TCDD has been recognized as a contaminant of commercial
preparations of 2,4,5-T for several years; however, there has been no
extensive study of its toxicity. According to JohnsonM' the acute
LDtjQ for TCDD is 0.022-0.045 mg/kg in the rat and 0.0006 mg/kg in
the guinea pig. Because of the high potency of this compound in
the guinea pig, these experiments were repeated and confirmed by
