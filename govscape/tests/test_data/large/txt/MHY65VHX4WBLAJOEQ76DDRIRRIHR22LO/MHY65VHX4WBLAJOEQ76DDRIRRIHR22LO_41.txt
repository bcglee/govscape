B. The Teratogenic Potential of 2,4,5-T
1. Scope of embryotoxicity. Teratology is the science dealing
with the causes, mechanisms, and manifestations of deviant structural
or functional development. Such deviation can be the result of mutation
in which case the defect may be transmitted by heredity, or it may be
induced by unfavorable environmental conditons during the developmental
period: usually during the formative stages of the embryo, less often
during functional maturation of the fetus, and possibly even during the
final stages of development postnatally.
Many types of adverse factors in the environment have been shown
to initiate abnormal development when applied during pregnancy in
laboratory animals, including: certain dietary deficiencies (mostly of
vitamins); many classes of chemicals, including some drugs; various
physical factors such as ionizing radiation, drastic temperature changes,
and alterations in atmospheric gases; a few viral infections; some
maternal endocrine and metabolic imbalances; and undoubtedly some
combinations of these.
Relatively few of these experimentally demonstrated teratogenic
agents have been shown to be effective in man. High doses of ionizing
radiation such as are used in therapy for cancer or emanate from
nuclear explosions are well known to be teratogenic when applied during
early human pregnancy. Two infectious agents, rubella and cytomegalic
viruses, have been clearly implicated. Three types of drugs - thalidomide,
folic acid antagonists, and androgenic hormones - have been established
as causes of malformations in man and a few others are suspected but are
not at this time proven to be teratogenic. Maternal metabolic diseases
