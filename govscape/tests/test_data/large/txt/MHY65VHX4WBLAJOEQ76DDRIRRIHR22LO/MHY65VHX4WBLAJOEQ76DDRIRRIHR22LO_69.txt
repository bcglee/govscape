both 2,4,5-T and TCDD. Acceptable data are now available on the
embryotoxicity of 2,4,5-T in 6 mammalian species, mouse, rat, hamster,
rabbit, sheep and rhesus monkey. None of these showed adverse effects
at dosage of 40 mg/kg/day of maternal weight.
The mouse appears to be more sensitive than the other forms
studied in that it shows a low level of teratogenicity (cleft palate)
at 100 mg/kg/day given throughout organogenesis, whereas hamster and
rat required higher dosage to obtain comparable effects. It is likely
that all species could be caused to show some embryotoxicity if 2,4,5-T
dosage were raised high enough, a fact already well known for many
prevalent environmental chemicals such as aspirin, caffein, nicotine
and organic mercury.
The dioxin contaminant TCDD also has been shown to have a low
teratogenic potential at doses in excess of 0.001 mg/kg, but this dosage
level is virtually impossible with currently produced 2,4,5-T. No
evidence has been found of significant potentiative interaction between
2,4,5-T and TCDD.
No evidence has been found of adverse effects on human reproduction
in three separate locations, namely Vietnam; Globe, Arizona; and Sweden,
where pregnant women have allegedly been exposed to high levels of
2,4,5-T.
On the basis of these observations, it is concluded that, as
presently produced and as applied according to regulations in force
prior to April 1970, 2,4,5-T represents no hazard to human reproduction.
