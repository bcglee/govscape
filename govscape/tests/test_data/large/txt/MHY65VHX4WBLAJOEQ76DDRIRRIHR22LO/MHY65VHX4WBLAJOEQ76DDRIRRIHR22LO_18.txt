spray concentration of 40 ppm, residue in the fruit had fallen to 0.004 ppm
in 22 days.—' The application of 2,4,5-T to blueberries at 1 Ib per acre
resulted in a concentration in the fruit of 0.05 to 0.33 ppm 44 days after
31 /
application although none was found 733 days after application.— No detect-
able 2,4,5-T (sensitivity =0.01 ppm) was found in rough rice 50 days after
•JO/
applying 2.25 Ib per acre of 2,4,5-T.—' The rice straw contained 0.18 to
1.04 ppm 2,4,5-T 50 days after but none 84 days after application.
Further evidence that very little 2,4,5-T gets into food is seen
in results of assays of raw agricultural products and in the Market Basket
Survey samples. From about 10,000 food and feed samples examined from 1964
through 1969 only 25 contained trace amounts of 2,4,5-T (less than 0.1 ppm)
and only two contained measurable amounts, 0.19 ppm in a sample of milk in
33/
1965 and 0.29 ppm in a sample of sugar beets in 1966.—' Furthermore, of
the 134 total diet samples involving 1600 food composites (Market Basket
Survey) analyzed from 1964 through April 1969, only 3 contained 2,4,5-T.
Two were dairy products containing 8 to 13% fat with 0.008 and 0.19 ppm in
the fat. A single meat, fish and poultry composite from Boston consisting
33/
of 17 to 23% of fat was found to contain 0.003 ppm 2,4,5-T on a fat basis.—'

It is concluded from the foregoing that: 1) The herbicide 2,4,5-T
does not accumulate in any compartment of the biosphere. 2) The risk of
human exposure to 2,4,5-T in food, air or water is negligible.
Fate of TCDD. Under present conditions of manufacture this con-
taminant is usually present in 2,4,5-T at less than 1 ppm, thus insuring
that very little TCDD is inadvertently applied with 2,4,5-T. Like 2,4,5-T
any contaminating TCDD would be deposited on the leaves of treated vegetation
