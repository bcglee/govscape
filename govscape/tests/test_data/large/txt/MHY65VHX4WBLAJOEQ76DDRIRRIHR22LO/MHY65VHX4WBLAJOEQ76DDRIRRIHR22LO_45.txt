the Children's Hospital Research Foundation of Cincinnati, on rats, mice,
hamsters, rabbits, sheep and rhesus monkeys using samples of 2,4,5-T
containing known concentrations of TCDD as well as relatively pure samples
of TCDD,
These studies are summarized below, species by species and separately
for 2,4,5-T and TCDD. Insofar as the original reports permits, data are
summarized on maternal toxicity, e.g., death or failure to show normal
weight gain during pregnancy; as well as on embryotoxicity and fetal
toxicity, e.g., prenatal death teratogenesis, intrauterine growth
retardation, and perinatal signs of other toxicity. It is recognized
that fetal death, either individual or as whole litters may also reflect
maternal toxicity, and therefore may be difficult to interpret.
2,4,5-T in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats at Dow Chemical Co. were
fed 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T containing 0.5 ppm of TCDD
on days 6 through 15 of pregnancy —'—'U . No maternal death or reduced
maternal weight gain during pregnancy was noted. There was also no
increase in prenatal mortality, only slight impairment of fetal growth
in a few cases at the 24 mg/kg dosage, and no malformations. The poor
ossification of the 5th sternebra noted in some cases was probably a
sign of mild transient retardation of skeletal development and of no
known significance. Pregnant rats of the same stock were fed 50 or 100
mg/kg/day of "commercial production grade" 2,4,5-T containing 0.5 ppm
TCDD on days 6 through 15 of gestation, or 100 mg/kg/day on days 6
through 10 _/OL/, The only effects observed after the lower dose were
intestinal hemorrhage in one of 203 offspring and a slight increase in
