properties have been observed at lower doses than 100 rag/kg so that the
question whether there is a zero effect for some dose is not easily answered.
A case in point is the data included in this report by the chairman of the
committee. The experiment provides for doses of 100, 200, and ^00 mg/kg
but only tests at one single low dose, that of 20 mg/kg, although the effect
of a dose at this low level is of utmost importance. Also, there are no
control animals. Cumulative experience with untreated controls over the
past four years and cumulative vehicle treated controls (per gavage) over
the past four years are used as controls. Given oxir knowledge of variation
in experiments, it is difficult to understand why this important experiment
was performed without a concurrent control. Yet, per cent dead or resorbed
fetuses show a trend toward lower dose which is still detectable at 20 mg/kg.
(Whether or not we think of this effect as large or small will depend on
whether or not we are willing to accept Control 1. or Control 2. of that
Study.) Taking these factors into consideration, it becomes difficult to
see how the report can conclude that "doses of low-dioxin-content 2,H,5-T and
of TCDD below the level producing maternal toxicity were without significant
effect on prenatal development producing little or no embryo-toxicity in
rats, rabbits, hamsters, sheep, and rhesus monkeys" (page 50, Final Draft).
If anything, the conclusion ought to have read that, despite the small
amount of data present, some of it does point to teratogenicity at lower
doses.
