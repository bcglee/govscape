movement in water, volatilization, movement by wind, and photochemical
decomposition. The persistence of 2,4,5-T is influenced by its rate of
application and by various climatic and edaphic factors, and occurs most
rapidly under conditions that are optimal for the growth of soil micro-
organisms.— At least two bacterial isolates, Mycoplano sp. and Achro-
mobacter sp.— — —— and one actinomycete, Streptomyces viridochromogenes—
from soil are known to metabolize 2,4,5-T. Br.evibacterium sp. has been
shown to cometabolize 2,4,5-T to a product tentatively identified as 3,5-
dichlorocatechol— . Morris— found that 2,4,5-T was decarboxylated in
the litter of the forest floor and had a half-life of approximately 40 days.

Loos— has thoroughly reviewed degradation of phenoxyalkanoic acids, in-
cluding 2,4,5-T. Loss of all phytotoxicity of 2,4,5-T applied to the soil
13/
was reported to occur 3 to 6 months after application.— No chemically
detectable amounts of 2,4,5-T were found in the soil 1 year after an
application of 2 Ib per acre and only very small amounts were found 3 to 7
months after application.— Although the rate of disappearance varies,
there have been no reports of carry-over of 2,4,5-T from one year to the
next, indicating that no build-up in the soil would result from recommended
rates of treatment repeated annually.
When phenoxy herbicides were first introduced, highly volatile esters
were available and farmers were inexperienced in their use, there were
several instances in which the drift through air produced severe injury to
sensitive crops, usually in adjoining fields or more rarely at some distance
from the point of application. Owing to accumulated experience and the
institution of regulations regarding the conditions under which applications
can be made, as well as the removal of the volatile esters from the market,
