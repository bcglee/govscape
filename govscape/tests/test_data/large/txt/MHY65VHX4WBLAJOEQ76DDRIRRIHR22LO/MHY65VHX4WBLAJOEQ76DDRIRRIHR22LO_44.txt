when given for several days during organogenesis. Cleft palate, cystic
kidneys, intestinal hemorrhage and fetal mortality occurred in higher
percentages of treated than of control animals although a clear dose-
response relation was not evident at lower doses. The results have been
reviewed elsewhere =J±J and published in summary form _' and therefore
require no extensive discussion here. Certain inconsistencies in the
data —/—- likewise need no comment because the sample 2,4,5-T used
in the Bionetics study is known to have been contaminated with 27 * 8
ppm of TCDD and the results can no longer be considered a valid indi-
cation of the teratogenicity of the herbicide. This contaminant
itself has since been shown to have teratogenic and embryolethal properties,
as will be discussed later. Despite the limitations of the original
Bionetics study, it served two useful functions, in: 1) highlighting
the possibility that herbicides may cause previously unknown adverse
effects on nontarget organisms, including mammals, and 2) emphasizing
the need for more thorough safety evaluation of such compounds before
they are approved for widespread use.
The discovery that the contaminant TCDD was present in the herbicide
used in the Bionetics study made it necessary to determine whether the
reported teratogenicity was caused by 2,4,5~T or TCDD. Additional
studies relating to this question have been completed at the Dow Chemical
Company, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institute for
Dental Research, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,
the Department of Agriculture Animal Disease and Parasite Research Division,
the Food and Drug Directorate of Canada, Bionetics Research Laboratories, and
