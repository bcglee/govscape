either a Hagerstown silty clay loam or a Norfolk sandy loam.— It would
thus appear that most of f-ho chemical falling on the soil surface would
remain there. The fate of TCDD mechanically incorporated into.soil has
39/
been investigated by the Department of Agriculture.— Radiolabeled TCDD
was mixed into soil at the rates of 1, 10, and 100 ppm and soil extracts
radio-assayed 20, 40, 80, and 160 days after application. The amount of
radioactive material (probably TCDD) in the soil decreased 15 to 20% in
160 days, indicating that this compound was very slowly degraded in the
soil and could persist for more than a year.
The possibility that TCDD incorporated in the soil might be absorbed
39 /
by plants has been studied.— Soybean and oat plants x^ere grown on Lake-
land sand containing 0.06 ppm radiolabeled TCDD, which is 40,000 times the
amount that would appear in soils treated with 2 Ib per acre of 2,4,5-T
containing 1 ppm TCDD. Less than 0.2% of the available TCDD was absorbed
by either type of plant, with radioactivity reaching a peak at 10 days at
which time it measured about 0.12 ppm in oats and 0.05 ppm in soybeans on
a dry weight basis, then it declined to an insignificant level at 40 days.
The most likely source of plant contamination by the TCDD present
as a contaminant in commercial 2,4,5-T is by way of foliar application.

When radioactive TCDD was applied to the surface of leaves— no material
was translocated from the site of application on the plant; but about 40
percent of the applied TCDD could be leached from the surface of the
leaves by water, probably because the TCDD was added with a surfactant.
This suggests that surface contamination could be the source of a very
small TCDD residue in leafy food plants, but 2,4,5-T is not used on such
