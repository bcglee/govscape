In one experiment 2,4,5-T (100 rag/kg) and TCDD (0.001 mg/kg) given
together apparently produced no greater frequency of cleft palate than
when each was given alone. TCDD greatly increased the background rate
S'f. kidney anomalies, especially in C57BL mice. Thus the limited data
indicate that TCDD has some teratogenic potential in mice at doses even
lower than those causing appreciable intrauterine death.
2,4,5-T in hamsters. Golden hamsters of a commercially obtained
stock were treated orally on days 6 through 10 of gestation with 20-100
mg/kg/day of 2,4,5-T from seven sources, at the Food and Drug Administra-
20/21/
tion Four of the samples contained 45, 2.9, 0.5 and 0.1 ppm
TCDD, respectively, and three contained no detectable TCDD. Information
on maternal toxicity was not given. Fetal mortality was greatly increased
by the TCDD-containing 2,4,5-T samples and its frequency was usually
directly related to both 2,4,5-T dosage and dioxin content; but it was
also moderately high and dose-related after 2,4,5-T containing no detect-
able dioxin. The mean weight of surviving fetuses was unaffected or only
mildly so for the different samples. A low to moderate incidence of
gastrointestinal hemorrhage was observed, but this was probably not
developmental in origin. Malformations were noted in offspring exposed
to 2,4,5-T containing TCDD or not, but their frequency was usually higher
after 2,4,5-T containing dioxin than after 2,4,5-T that did not. No
malformations were produced by 2,4,5-T alone below the 100 mg/kg dose,
whereas all dosages of dioxin-containing 2,4,5-T produced malformations.
Very few malformations (cleft palate, 2 cases, and ectopic heart, 1 case)
resulted from use of dioxin-containing 2,4,5-T, and only at 100 mg/kg.
