Fate of TCDD. Piper and Rose —' have reported a preliminary
study of the tissue distribution and disposition of C-labeled TCDD
administered as a single oral dose of 0.05 mg/kg to male rats. The
biological half-time for this dose was approximately 20 days, and fecal
excretion accounted for the greater part of the TCDD removal. Three days
after administration 3.1% of the total dose per gram was recovered from
liver and 3.0% of the total dose per gram was contained in fat. The
residual radioactivity in these tissues was not identified and therefore
cannot be assumed to be TCDD. The fact that 8.3% of the dose was
14
recovered from C0 in expired air indicated that some of the TCDD was
2
completely metabolized.
The Dow Chemical Co. has recently provided comparative solubility
data on TCDD and p.p'DDT at 24°C, as follows:
PPM of Solvent
TCDD p.p'DDT
corn oil 28 86,000
lard oil 44 86,000
water 0.0002 0.001
Although suggesting a petitioning toward fat, these data clearly indicate
that, unlike DDT, TCDD is so insoluble in fat that it would not be expected
to accumulate in body fat depots in appreciable amounts.
It is concluded from the foregoing that: 1) 2,4,5-T is rapidly
excreted in all animals studied using doses in the range of those likely
to be encountered in the environment; 2) 2,4,5-T is not known to be
accumulated in any animal tissues or product used for human food;
