Vietnaraese women, Including what amounts they ingested or absorbed and
when this may have occurred during pregnancey. Thus, any attempt to
relate birth defects or stillbirths to herbicide exposure is predestined
to failure. It can only be concluded that the birth records that have
been surveyed, and probably any that will be surveyed in the future, for
South Vietnam for the period 1960-1970 cannot answer positively the
questions about possible adverse prenatal effects following human exposure
to 2,4,5-T. It must be emphasized, however, that the searches that have
been made almost certainly would have revealed any marked increase in the
incidence of birth defects or the introduction of a striking defect such
as that produced by thalidomide. In spite of considerable effort, no such
occurrences were found.

Globe, Arizona was another site of human exposure â€”. The herb-
icides used in the Kellner Canyon-Russell Gulch spray project near Globe
were, in 1965 and 1966 the isooctyl esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, in 1968
an ester of Silvex (2,4,5-TP), and in 1969 about 97% Silvex (3680 Ib) and
almost 3% 2,4,5-T esters (Hercules Co., 30 gal.). The reports of harmful
effects to animals and people from the spraying began during and after
the 1969 spraying. Those concerning possible reproductive and embryonic
effects consisted of two miscarriages by a woman, one in April and the
other in December 1969; a number of stillbirths of kids; and one mis-
carriage in a goat. Two other alleged cases consisted of a deformed goat
approximately 5 years old, and therefore born before any herbicide spraying
in the area (incidentally the defects were not of developmental origin),
and a chicken with a slipped tendon which was incubated 4 miles from the
sprayed area and after the spraying occurred in 1969. In all likelihood
none of these reported effects was due to the sprayings. Competent
