SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Potential Wetland Area 1 – Plots 1A, 1B and 1C
Barley (Hordeum vulgare, 40%), Ellisia (Ellisia nyctelea, 15%), mullein
(Verbascum thapsus, 15%), nipple-wort (Lapsana communis, 10%) and
green foxtail (Setaria viridis, 10%) were identified in Plot 1A. All observed
species are herbaceous. Barley, the most dominant of the present species,
is not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North
Central, Region 3). However, other plants of the Hordeum genus were
listed, and their wetland indicators range from FAC to FAC+. Ellisia was the
only other plant identified in Plot 1A with a wetland indicator status wetter
than FAC. Ellisia’s indicator is FAC+, and its dominance was 15%. The
remainder of the plants identified in Plot 1A are either not listed or have a
wetland indicator status of FAC or drier: mullein (FACU-, 15%), nipple-wort
(NL, 10%) and green foxtail (FAC to FACU+, 10%). Barley, the dominant
species of Plot 1A, does not have a listed wetland indicator status and the
wetland indicator statuses of its listed relatives are neutral to slightly wetter
than neutral. Ellisia, the only species identified in Plot 1A with a wetland
indicator wetter than neutral, occurred at a dominance of only 15%.
Therefore, Plot 1A does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Nipple-wort (Lapsana communis, 60%), freshwater cordgrass (Spartina
pectinata, 30%) and common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca, 5%) were
identified in Plot 1B. All observed species are herbaceous. Nipple-wort, the
most dominant plant species of Plot 1B, is not listed in the National List of
Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). Freshwater
cordgrass, comprising 30% of the present plant species in Plot 1B, has a
wetland indicator of FACW+. Common milkweed (5% dominance) is not
listed; however, indicator statuses for other members of the Asclepias genus
range from OBL to UPL. Plot 1B was established in a depressional area with
a potential to accumulate water during rain and/or flooding events.
Therefore, it is expected that at least some plant species adapted for wet
environments would be present here (i.e., freshwater cordgrass). However,
