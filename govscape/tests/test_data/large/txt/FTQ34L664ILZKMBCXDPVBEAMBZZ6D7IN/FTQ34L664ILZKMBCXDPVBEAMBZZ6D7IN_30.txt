3.2 SOILS
Electronic files for the Soil Surveys of Carroll County and Ray County,
Missouri were requested from the Natural Resource Conservation Service
(NRCS) website. Hard copies of each of the soil surveys were also obtained
during a visit to the local NRCS offices.
The facility property is within the limits of Carroll County. According to the
Carroll County soil survey, the facility property lies primarily within the
Bremer-Cotter-Booker association. Soils of this association are
characterized as deep, nearly level, well-drained, poorly-drained and very
poorly-drained soils that formed in alluvium. Soils of this association occur
on floodplains. Bremer soils account for about 43 percent of the Bremer-
Cotter-Booker association. Bremer soils are poorly drained, and in slightly
higher areas on the floodplain. Cotter soils comprise 27 percent of the
association. These soils are well-drained, and in higher areas of the
floodplain. Booker soils comprise 19 percent of the Bremer-Cotter-Booker
association. Booker soils are very poorly-drained. They are in the lower
areas of the floodplain. Other minor soils comprise 11 percent of the
Bremer-Cotter-Booker association. The northernmost portion of the facility
