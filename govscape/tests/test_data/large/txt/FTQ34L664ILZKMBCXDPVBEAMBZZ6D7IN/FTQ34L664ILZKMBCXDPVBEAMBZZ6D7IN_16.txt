SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
In addition to examining the drainage ditches, creeks and a section of the
railroad corridor, the field investigators visually examined approximately 60
acres comprising the northeastern portion of the facility property (Kevin
Edgar property on Figure 2). This area appeared to be formerly farmed,
and is presently fallow field. No potential wetlands were observed in the
area. An unnamed creek traverses the landscape here. Field personnel
walked the length of the creek. For the most part, the creek bed was very
steep with little benching. When benching was observed, it was typically
just upstream of felled trees that had partially dammed the creek, thus,
causing water to backup in very high flow conditions. Given that some
element of hydrology could be present in these benched areas, field
personnel conducted a cursory review of vegetation, if any, and soils present
at the benched areas. No wetland indicators were present (see Photos #17
and #18).
3.1 VEGETATION
The vegetation parameter was examined for existing vegetative cover types.
The vegetative cover was evaluated based on established wetland vegetation
criteria.
At each area or plot suspected of being a wetland, the dominant vegetative
species was evaluated at four levels of strata (over-story or tree canopy;
subcanopy or shrub layer; groundcover or herbaceous layer and vine) or at
each level of vegetative strata present. More than fifty percent of the plant
species in an area must be hydrophytic (e.g., plants having adaptations for
growing in anaerobic conditions) in order for that area to meet the
vegetative criteria for wetlands. The three types of hydrophytic plants
identified in the COE 1987 Manual are obligate (OBL), facultative wetland
(FACW) and facultative (FAC). Obligate wetland plants almost always (99%)
naturally occur in wetlands. Facultative wetland plants usually (66%) occur
in wetlands. Facultative plants have a similar likelihood of occurring in both
wetlands and non-wetlands. Each of the plant species observed to exist in
