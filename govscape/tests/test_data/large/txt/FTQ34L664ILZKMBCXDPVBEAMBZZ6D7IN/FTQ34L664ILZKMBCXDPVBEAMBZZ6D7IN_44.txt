Discussion of Wetlands
compact. Moisture increased slightly with depth. Plot 11B was established
within the depressional area, between Plot points 11A and 11C.
Plot 11C contained topsoil at a depth of 0 to 16 inches bgs. The soil was
very dry throughout the probe. Plot 11C was established upslope of the
apparent drainageway, at an elevation equivalent to that of Plot 11A.
Plots 11A and 11C did not display features characteristic of hydric soil. Plot
11B did contain low chroma matrix colors and mottles, features
characteristic of hydric soil. Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are listed on
the local Hydric Soils List. Field observations for Plot 11B did confirm the
mapped type.
Corridor Alternatives #1, #2 and #3
Only a visual screening survey was conducted for the three alternative
corridors outside of the facility property; therefore, soil samples were not
collected in these areas and detailed observations of soils were not made.
The three alternative corridors span both Carroll and Ray Counties.
Figure 5 presents the NRCS soil map for the area including the facility
property and the three alternative corridors. Due to the abundance and
distribution of mapped soil types that lie within the corridor areas, the soil
map unit designations are not displayed. Alternatively, each mapped soil
area was classified as having either a high, medium or low potential to be
hydric. The mapped soil areas classified as having high potential to be
hydric were those where the major soil type is included on the local hydric
soils list. The areas classified as having a medium potential to be hydric
were those where the major soil type is not included on the local hydric soils
list, but inclusions of the major soil type are on the hydric soils list. The
mapped soil areas classified as having low potential to be hydric were those
where neither the major soil type for that area, nor its inclusions, are
included on the local hydric soils list.
