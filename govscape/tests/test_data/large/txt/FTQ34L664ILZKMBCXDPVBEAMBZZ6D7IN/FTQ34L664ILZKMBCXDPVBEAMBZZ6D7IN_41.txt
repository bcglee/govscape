SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
field observations for Plot 7A did not confirm the Bremer mapped type, nor
its inclusions (Cotter and Leta).
Potential Wetland Area 8 – Plots 8A and 8B
Plot points 8A and 8B were established adjacent to a drainage ditch running
through a cultivated soybean field. Plot 8A was upland of Plot 8B.
The surface soil at Plot 8A consisted of topsoil (0-16 inches bgs). Plot 8A
was established immediately adjacent to the planted soybean field. Some
clay was present at the base of the soil probe.
Plot 8B soils consisted of clay/silt at a depth of 0-10 inches bgs. The
clay/silt was black (7.5YR 2.5/1). At a depth of 10 inches bgs, the soil color
changed to reddish black (2.5YR 2.5/1). Red (2.5YR 4/8) mottling was
observed from 10 to 16 inches bgs. The mottles were few, distinct and
medium. Soil moisture at Plot 8B increased with depth. Plot 8B was
established in the center of the drainageway.
Plot 8A did not display characteristics of hydric soil, whereas Plot 8B soils did
display low chroma matrix colors and mottling. Soils of this area, Booker
silty clay, are listed on the local Hydric Soils List. Field observations for Plot
8A did not confirm the mapped type and inclusions, but observed soils at
Plot 8B did generally confirm the mapped type.
Potential Wetland Area 9 – Plots 9A, 9B and 9C
Plot points 9A, 9B and 9C were established adjacent to and within a drainage
ditch. This drainage ditch was bounded by a cultivated soybean field on one
side and a county road on the other.
The soil at Plot 9A consisted of topsoil (0 to 8 inches bgs). Refusal was
encountered at 8 inches bgs. The soil at Plot 9A was dry. Plot 9A was
established immediately downslope of the soybean field and upslope of the
drainage ditch.
