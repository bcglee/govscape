SECTION TWO
Methodology
The field investigators traversed the drainage ditches and creeks throughout
the 1,500-acre facility property, in addition to the corridor immediately north
of the BNSF railroad bounding the southern portion of the facility property.
Utilizing observations of changes in vegetation and evidence of potential
hydrology, the investigators established investigation plots for potential
wetlands along the drainage ditches, creeks and railroad corridor. Plots 1, 2
and 3 were established on the north side of the south-bounding BNSF
railroad. Plots 4, 5, 7 and 8 were established along the Norborne Drainage
Ditch. Plot 6 was established at the convergence of three drainage ditches
within a farmed field in the southwestern portion of the facility property.
Plot 9 was established along a roadside drainage ditch, adjacent to County
Road 300. Plots 10 and 11 were established along a drainage ditch within a
farmed field in the north-central portion of the facility property. Information
concerning the present vegetative species, nature of the soils and hydrology
characteristics is presented in Section 3 of the report.
