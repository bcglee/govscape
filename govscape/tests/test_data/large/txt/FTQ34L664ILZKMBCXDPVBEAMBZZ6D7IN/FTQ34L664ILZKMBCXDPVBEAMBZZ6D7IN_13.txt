SECTION TWO
Methodology
The “Plot Type” survey was utilized to examine the area immediately
adjacent to creeks and drainage ditches. In this method, two to three data
points were evaluated at each plot location, with at least one point inside the
potential wetland boundary and one outside the potential wetland boundary.
For each examined point, a soil probe was advanced to a targeted depth of
16 inches below ground surface (bgs), and soils were logged for texture,
color, depth, hydric soil indicators and any other taxonomic characteristics
deemed important for that point. The COE 1987 Manual makes
accommodations for advancement of a probe rather than establishment of a
soil pit when the soil profile is not comprised of loose or rocky material or
does not contain a large volume of water. Vegetation was characterized for
the area by dominance, stratum and wetland indicator status.
The COE 1987 Manual provided the principle guidelines for conducting the
fieldwork for the delineation. The COE 1987 Manual, as well as other field
references, were used to review the existing field condition information, to
determine the presence of wetland vegetation, soils and hydrology. A listing
of references is contained in Appendix A, the completed field data forms
are in Appendix B, photographic documentation of site conditions is
included in Appendix C and historical aerial photographs (years 2003 and
2004) are included in Appendix D.
2.3 ATYPICAL SITUATIONS
An atypical situation may exist if positive indicators of hydrophytic
vegetation, hydric soils and/or wetland hydrology could not be found due to
effects of recent human activities or natural events. Activities and/or events
include unauthorized activities, natural events and man-induced wetlands.
Although one or more of the indicators may not exist, the area may be
determined as a wetland by utilizing historic information from sources such
as aerial photography, previous site inspections, adjacent vegetation, NRCS
records, public interviews (individuals familiar with the area) and NWI maps.
