SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is comprised of plants with
an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore, Plot 7A meets the
hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 8 – Plots 8A and 8B
Soybean (Glycine max, 50%) was identified in Plot 8A. It is a cultivated,
herbaceous species. Soybean is not listed in the National List of Plants that
Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). Plot 8A was established
immediately adjacent to a planted soybean field. This plot does not meet
the hydrophytic criteria.
False flax (Camelina microcarpa, 30%) and winter cress (Barbarea vulgaris,
10%) were identified in Plot 8B. Both species are herbaceous. False flax is
not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central,
Region 3). However, other species of the Camelina genus are listed with a
wetland indicator status of FAC-. Winter cress has a wetland indicator of
FAC. Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot
is not comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter.
Therefore, Plot 8B does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 9 – Plots 9A, 9B and 9C
Barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli, 90%) and eastern burningbush
(Euonymus atropurpureus, 1%) were identified in Plot 9A. Barnyard grass is
a herbaceous species and eastern burningbush is a sapling/shrub species.
Barnyard grass has a wetland indicator status of FACW. Eastern
burningbush has an indicator status of FAC-. Plot 9A meets the hydrophytic
criteria.
Barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli, 50%), arrowhead (Sagittaria
ambigua, 40%), groundnut (Apios americana, 5%) and winter grape (Vitis
vulpina, 5%) were identified in Plot 9B. Barnyard grass and arrowhead are
herbaceous species. Groundnut and winter grape are vines. Barnyard grass
