Discussion of Wetlands
not support a prevalence of hydrophytic species and does not meet the
hydrophytic criteria.
Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus, 50%), sandbar willow (Salix exigua,
40%), common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca, 5%), nipple-wort (Lapsana
communis, 5%) and wild morning glory (Convolvulus sepium, <1%) were
identified in Plot 3B. Yellow nutsedge, common milkweed and nipple-wort
are herbaceous species. Sandbar willow is a sapling/shrub species and wild
morning glory is a vine. Yellow nutsedge (50%), the most dominant plant
species observed in Plot 3B, is not listed in the National List of Plants that
Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). However, other species of the
genus Cyperus are listed, and their wetland indicators range from FACU- to
OBL. Sandbar willow has a wetland indicator of OBL. Common milkweed
(5%) is not listed; however, other species of the genus Asclepias have
wetland indicators that range from UPL to OBL. Nipple-wort (5%) and wild
morning glory (<1%) are not listed. The “scatter” of wetland indicator
status for observed plant species is wide. Estimates of species’ dominance,
together with the fact that this plot was established in a depressional area
likely to pond water during rain and/or flood events, indicates that at least
50% of the plot is comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or
wetter. Therefore, Plot 3B meets the hydrophytic criteria.
Wheat (Triticum aestivum, 40%), nipple-wort (Lapsana communis, 20%),
giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida, 10%), wild oat (Avena fatua, 10%),
fleabane (Erigeron canadensis, 10%) and sandbar willow (Salix exigua,
10%) were identified in Plot 3C. Wheat, nipple-wort, giant ragweed, wild
oat and fleabane are herbaceous species. Sandbar willow is a sapling/shrub
species. Wheat, nipple-wort and wild oat are not listed in the National List of
Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). Giant ragweed
(10%) has a wetland indicator of FAC+. Fleabane is not listed; however,
other listed species of the Erigeron genus have wetland indicators ranging
from FACU to FACW. Sandbar willow has an indicator status of OBL. The
