Discussion of Wetlands
were reviewed. The total estimated duration and dates of the annual
growing season for Carroll County were obtained from the local NRCS office.
The River elevation data were compared to the known elevations of the
facility property, to determine if, and how often, various portions of the
property are inundated or potentially saturated during the growing season.
According to the Carroll County, Missouri NRCS office, the annual growing
season is approximately 190 days in duration. The date of the last spring
frost is typically April 10 and the first fall frost is typically on October 17.
Assuming a 190-day growing season, the 10-day (5% of growing season)
and 24-day (12.5% of growing season) high water elevations for the time
period between April 10 and October 17 were determined for the Missouri
River Waverly, Missouri gage station. The 10-day high elevation represents
the highest River elevation maintained for at least 10 consecutive days
within the growing season. In turn, the 24-day high elevation represents
the highest River elevation maintained for at least 24 consecutive days
within the growing season. The 10-day and 24-day high water elevations for
each of the years 1996 through 2005 were identified. The 10-day high
water elevations for the ten years examined were averaged and the same
was done for the 24-day high water elevations. The average 10-day and 24-
day high water elevations for the Waverly, Missouri gage station were
663.54 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and 661.61 feet
NGVD, respectively. Appendix E of this report includes the 10-day and 24-
day high water elevations for the ten years examined (see the References
section of this report for the source of the complete set of water elevation
data).
Review of USGS Topographical Maps
Potential areas that may meet the wetland hydrology criteria were screened
by reviewing the USGS 1978 Norborne, Missouri 7.5 Minute Series
Quadrangle Topographic Map. Specifically, the map (Figure 6) was utilized
to aid in the identification of low lying areas and depressional areas that may
