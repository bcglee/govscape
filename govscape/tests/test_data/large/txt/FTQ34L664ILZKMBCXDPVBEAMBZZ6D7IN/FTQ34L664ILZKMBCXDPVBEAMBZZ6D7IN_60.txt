Delineation of Wetlands

approximately 5 feet up the bank, does surround the Norborne Drainage
Ditch.
Plot area 6 was established at the convergence of three drainage ditches
within a cultivated soybean field. This area was not identified as a wetland
since it did not meet the hydrophytic vegetation parameter nor the wetland
hydrology parameter. The majority of the vegetation in this area was not
suited to wet conditions. Signs of hydrology, such as soil saturation within
the upper 12 inches of ground surface, were lacking. The surface soils in the
area displayed prominent cracking, indicating that the area had not held
significant water for some time.
Plot area 9 was established adjacent to a roadside drainage ditch. The ditch
was heavily overgrown with volunteer vegetation. Each of the three plots
established in this area met the hydrophytic vegetation parameter; however,
none of the plots displayed signs of wetland hydrology. Plot 9B, advanced
within the drainageway, did display gleyed soils with prominent mottling;
however, soils were not heavily saturated. Standing water was present
within the ditches where they converge at road intersections. Vegetation
growth patterns suggest that these areas hold sufficient water to encourage
the presence of hydric soils and to support a predominance of hydrophytic
vegetation.
Plot areas 10 and 11 were established within a shaded corridor between two
soybean fields. The corridor contained a central depressional area that
appeared as though it may accumulate water. None of the plots established
within Plot area 10 were identified as wetland. Plot 11B, established within
the drainageway, was identified as wetland. Plots 11A and 11C, located 2 to
3 feet higher than the drainageway were not identified as wetland areas.
Therefore, a wetland fringe, measuring approximately 1 to 2 feet on either
side of the depressional area near Plot 11, exists.
In addition to Plot areas 1 through 11, field investigators examined the creek
which traverses the Kevin Edgar property (northeast portion of the facility
property). A wetland area was not identified adjacent to this creek. The
