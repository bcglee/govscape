SECTION TWO
Methodology
Section F of the COE 1987 Manual governs treatment of atypical situations
regarding wetlands.
Protocols in Section F of the COE 1987 Manual should not be used in
circumstances where human activities were previously authorized or
exempted from COE regulation. In these circumstances, the procedures
presented for either the routine or comprehensive method must be followed.
Concerning the area under investigation for this preliminary jurisdictional
wetland determination, the entire 1,500-acre facility property has essentially
been impacted by recent human activities (i.e., farming and its associated
practices). Given that these activities are exempted from COE regulation,
the investigated area was treated per the COE Routine Method guidelines.
2.4 REVIEW OF HYDROLOGY
Wetland hydrology criteria were reviewed by utilizing available topographic
mapping, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance
Rate Maps (FIRM), on-site field indicators, available aerial photography and
gage data for major nearby water bodies.
The wetlands field investigation for the 1,500-acre facility property was
conducted on August 1 and 2, 2006. A drive-by visual survey of the corridor
alternatives was conducted on August 3, 2006. At the time of the
investigation, temperatures were high and precipitation was below normal
for the season. The smaller drainage ditches within the investigated area
were dry at the time of the investigation; however, the larger creeks and
drainageways did carry some water. Weather conditions evident during the
investigation are of little significance in making the determination because
most evaluated parameters only develop over prolonged wet conditions and
do not normally exist as a result of temporary conditions or fluctuations.
With this in mind, this section discusses the site conditions as they were
observed in the field and as they pertain to the parameters outlined in the
COE 1987 Manual.
