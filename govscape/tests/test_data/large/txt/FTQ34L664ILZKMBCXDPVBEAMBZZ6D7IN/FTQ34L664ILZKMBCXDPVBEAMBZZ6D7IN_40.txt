SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
listed on the local Hydric Soils List. Field observations for Plots 5A and 5B
generally confirmed the mapped type.
Potential Wetland Area 6 – Plot 6A
Plot 6A was established in a depressional area within a soybean field, at the
confluence of three drainage ditches.
The surface soil at Plot 6A consisted of silt (0-1 inches bgs), and was black
(2.5Y 2.5/1). The surface layer was underlain by black (2.5Y 2.5/1) clay
with silt. The clay layer extended from 1 inch bgs to 16 inches bgs. The soil
matrix color changed to dark gray (5Y 4/1) at a depth of 10 inches bgs.
Mottling was also observed at a depth of 10 inches bgs, and extended
through the remainder of the soil probe. The mottles were common,
distinct, medium and light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) in color. The soil moisture
at Plot 6A increased with depth, with the soil being very moist at a depth of
12 to 16 inches bgs.
Plot 6A displayed the low chroma matrix colors and mottling characteristic of
hydric soil. Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are also listed on the local
Hydric Soils List. Field observations for Plot 6A generally confirmed the
mapped type.
Potential Wetland Area 7 – Plot 7A
Plot 7A was established immediately upland of a steep slope leading to a
drainage ditch.
The surface soil at Plot 7A consisted of silt with trace sand (0-16 inches
bgs), and was dark brown (7.5YR 3/2). Mottling was not observed. The soil
was primarily dry at Plot 7A, with some moisture present with depth.
Plot 7A did not display characteristics of hydric soils. Soils of this area,
Bremer silty clay loam, are listed on the local Hydric Soils List. However,
