SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
According to the USFWS NWI map (Figure 9), palustrine, forested/shrub
wetlands were identified within the alternative corridors, in addition to
palustrine, emergent wetlands. The palustrine, forested/shrub wetlands
occur primarily along the major creeks (Wakenda Creek and its West Fork).
Several freshwater ponds also dot the landscape within the alternative
corridor areas. As stated above, the FWS wetland classification system
requires that a positive indicator of wetlands be present for only one of the
three parameters, while the COE 1987 Manual requires that positive
indicators for each of the three parameters be present to classify an area as
a wetland.
