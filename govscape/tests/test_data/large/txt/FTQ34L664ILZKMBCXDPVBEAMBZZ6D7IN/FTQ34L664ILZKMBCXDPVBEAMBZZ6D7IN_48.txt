Discussion of Wetlands
42E3 Armster clay loam, 9-20% slopes
56B Grundy silt loam
* note that the new 5-digit map unit numbers were not available for the Ray
County, Missouri soil classification.
The Colo silty clay loam and Zook silty clay loam were the only two above-
listed soils classified as hydric by the Ray County, Missouri NRCS.
3.3 HYDROLOGY
According to the COE 1987 Manual, areas with evident wetland hydrology
have a presence and abundance of water such that it produces anaerobic
and reducing conditions and influences the characteristics of the vegetation
and soil present. The COE 1987 Manual also states that it is “essential to
establish that a wetland area is periodically inundated or has saturated soils
during the growing season”. Table 5 of the COE 1987 Manual specifies the
percentages of the growing season in which typical wetland and non-wetland
areas are saturated or inundated. Most wetland areas are at least
seasonally inundated or saturated (i.e. saturated/inundated for a minimum
of 12.5% of the growing season). The COE 1987 Manual states that those
areas saturated or inundated for only 5% to 12.5% of the growing season
are typically not classified as wetlands. This implies that some wetland
areas may be saturated or inundated for less than 12.5% of the growing
season (i.e. saturated/inundated for 5% to 12.5% of the growing season).
Review of Missouri River Gage Data and Carroll County Growing
Season Data
The facility property lies within the Missouri River floodplain, yet
approximately six miles north of the River. Missouri River data collected
from the Waverly, Missouri gage station (#06895500) were obtained from
the USGS National Water Information System: Web Interface. These data
included daily water elevations for the Waverly, Missouri gage station (this is
the nearest Missouri River gage station to the facility property). The
elevation data available for the most recent ten-year period (1996-2005)
