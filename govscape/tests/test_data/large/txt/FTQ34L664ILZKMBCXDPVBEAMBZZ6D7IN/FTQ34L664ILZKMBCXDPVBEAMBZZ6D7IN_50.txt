SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
be subject to periodic inundation for a sufficient length of time to provide
wetland hydrology. The USGS topographic map indicates that the facility
property has a flat topography with little relief. According to the 1978
topographic map, the elevation of the facility property ranges from 675 feet
NGVD to 685 feet NGVD. An area of higher elevation, with significant relief
occurs immediately north of the facility property. Given that the 5% and
12.5% growing season high water elevations for the Missouri River at the
nearest gage station are approximately 664 feet NGVD and 662 feet NGVD,
respectively, the elevation of the facility property is great enough that it is
not likely it would be flooded for the sufficient period characteristic of
wetland areas. Additionally, the USGS topographical map displays an
agricultural levee bordering the north side of the Missouri River in the
vicinity of the facility property.
Review of NRCS Designation Maps
The NRCS designation map was reviewed for the northern portion of the
facility property (north of County Road DD). According to the NRCS
designation map, a wetland area exists immediately west of the northern
facility property line. According to personnel interviewed at the Carroll
County, Missouri NRCS office, that area is in the Stateâ€™s Wetland Reserve
Program (WRP). The WRP, managed through the NRCS, is a voluntary
program offering landowners the opportunity to protect, enhance and
restore wetlands on their property, with technical and potential financial
assistance from the NRCS. Field personnel noted, during the site
investigation, that this area was marked with conservation boundary signs.
Review of Federal Emergency Management Agency Maps
The FEMA Firm Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Carroll County, Missouri
(Panels 290057 0100 B and 290057 0175 B, dated 10/17/96) and Ray
County, Missouri (Panels 290778 0050 B and 290778 0100 B, dated
01/19/83) (Figure 7) were reviewed to determine if any areas within the
facility property and corridor alternatives exist within the 100 Year Flood
