SECTION FIVE
Conclusions
Missouri River floodplain. According to the FEMA flood insurance rate maps,
the majority of the area comprising Alternative Corridor #1 lies within the
100 Year Flood Zone. USFWS NWI maps display a smattering of freshwater
emergent wetland areas throughout this area.
Alternative Corridors #2 and #3 contain soils of the Knox-Higginsville-
Wakenda association, the Lagonda-Armster-Grundy association, the
Armster-Lagonda-Sharpsburg association, the Zook-Nodaway-Bremer
association and the Grundy-Lagonda association. Soils of these associations
are generally characterized as somewhat poorly-drained to moderately well-
drained, deep and gently sloping to strongly sloping. Several hydric-listed
soils are included in Alternative Corridors #2 and #3. Alternative Corridors
#2 and #3 lie north of the facility property. These corridors are situated
primarily in an upland area comprised of the bluffs which border the Missouri
River floodplain. The elevation in this area ranges between 700 feet and
800 feet NGVD. Alternative Corridors #2 and #3 contain a significant
portion of Wakenda Creek and the Wakenda Creek West Fork, respectively.
Wakenda Creek is a major tributary in the area. Wakenda Creek and its
tributaries drain most of the western portion of Carroll County, the southern
portion of the uplands and the northern part of the bottomlands. Wakenda
Creek flows east toward the Missouri River. Likewise, much of the extent of
these creeks is bordered by forest, as evidenced in the drive-by survey, on
USGS topographical maps and on the USFWS NWI maps. Wakenda Creek
and the Wakenda Creek West Fork each have associated floodplains, that of
Wakenda Creek being greater in width. These floodplains are considered to
be within the 100 Year Flood Zone, according to FEMA. In addition to the
forested/shrub wetland areas traversing both Alternative Corridors #2 and
#3, the USFWS NWI maps display some emergent wetland areas and
freshwater ponds throughout the corridors.
