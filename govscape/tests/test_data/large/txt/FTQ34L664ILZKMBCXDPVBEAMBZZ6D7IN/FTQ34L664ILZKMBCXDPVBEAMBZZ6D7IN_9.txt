SECTION ONE
Background
Associated Electric Cooperative Inc. (AECI) is proposing to develop a new
660 megawatt baseload coal-fired generation unit at the site of the subject
preliminary jurisdictional wetland determination. The subject property is
located near the town of Norborne, in northwest Missouri. The constructed
generation unit would require direct access to two nearby, existing rail lines.
Three alternative rail corridors have been identified for the Norborne site,
two to the rail line to the north of the site and one to the rail line to the
south of the site.
AECIâ€™s proposed construction of the Norborne facility is classified as a major
federal action, given that AECI has applied for project financing through
USDA/RUS. The project, thus, necessitates review under the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The planning for the EIS identified the
need for a wetland delineation in the area of the proposed plant structures,
including the access roads, water line, discharge line and substations.
Additionally, the EIS planning identified the need for review of available data
to identify potential wetlands in the proposed rail corridors.
This report presents the findings of the preliminary jurisdictional wetland
determination conducted for the proposed Norborne generation unit. Both a
review of available documented information and a drive-by survey were
conducted for the three alternative rail corridors. Findings for the rail
corridors are also presented in this report. This report addresses both
jurisdictional wetlands and Waters of the United States that may exist in the
area anticipated as a part of the development effort. The property currently
owned by AECI and intended for development of the generation unit is
herein referred to as the facility property. The proposed rail corridors are
herein referred to as the corridor alternatives.
