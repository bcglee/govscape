SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
(50%) has a wetland indicator status of FACW. Arrowhead (40%) has a
wetland indicator status of OBL. Groundnut (5%) has a wetland indicator of
FACW. Winter grape (5%) has a wetland indicator of FACW-. Estimates of
species’ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is comprised of
plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore, Plot 9B meets
the hydrophytic criteria.
Barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli, 50%), nipple-wort (Lapsana
communis, 40%), blue vervain (Verbena hastata, 5%) and winter grape
(Vitis vulpina, 1%) were identified in Plot 9C. Barnyard grass, nipple-wort
and blue vervain are herbaceous species. Winter grape is a vine. Barnyard
grass (50%) has a wetland indicator status of FACW. Nipple-wort (40%) is
not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central,
Region 3). Blue vervain (5%) has an indicator status of FACW+. Winter
grape (1%) has an indicator status of FACW-. Estimates of species’
dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is comprised of plants with
an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore, Plot 9C meets the
hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 10 – Plots 10A, 10B and 10C
Roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii, 40%), sweet vernal grass
(Anthoxanthum odoratum, 10%) and cinquefoil (Potentilla canadensis, 10%)
were identified in Plot 10A. Sweet vernal grass is a herbaceous species,
roughleaf dogwood is a tree and cinquefoil is a vine. Roughleaf dogwood
(40%) has a wetland indicator status of FAC. Sweet vernal grass (10%) has
an indicator status of FACU. Cinquefoil (10%) is not listed in the National
List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). However,
other species of the Potentilla genus are listed, with wetland indicators
ranging from FACU- to OBL. Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that
at least 50% of the plant species in this plot have an indicator status of FAC
or wetter. Therefore, Plot 10A does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
