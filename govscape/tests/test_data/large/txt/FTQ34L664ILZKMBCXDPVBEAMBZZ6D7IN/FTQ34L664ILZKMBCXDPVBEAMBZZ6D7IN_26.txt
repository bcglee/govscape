SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum, 20%), roughleaf dogwood
(Cornus drummondii, 20%) and cinquefoil (Potentilla canadensis, 5%) were
identified in Plot 10B. Sweet vernal grass is a herbaceous species, roughleaf
dogwood is a tree and cinquefoil is a vine. Sweet vernal grass (20%) has a
wetland indicator status of FACU. Roughleaf dogwood (20%) has an
indicator status of FAC. Cinquefoil (5%) is not listed in the National List of
Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). However, other
listed species of the Potentilla genus have wetland indicators ranging from
FACU- to OBL. This plot area contains little ground vegetation, but is heavily
shaded. Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the
plot is not comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter.
Therefore, Plot 10B does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii, 20%), sweet vernal grass
(Anthoxanthum odoratum, 10%) and cinquefoil (Potentilla canadensis, 5%)
were identified in Plot 10C. Sweet vernal grass is a herbaceous species,
roughleaf dogwood is a tree and cinquefoil is a vine. Roughleaf dogwood
(20%) has a wetland indicator status of FAC. Sweet vernal grass (10%) has
a wetland indicator status of FACU. Cinquefoil (5%) is not listed in the
National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3).
However, other listed species of the Potentilla genus have wetland indicators
that range from FACU- to OBL. Groundcover is somewhat sparse in this plot
area, but it is heavily shaded. Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that
at least 50% of the plant species present in this plot have an indicator status
of FAC or wetter. Therefore, Plot 10C meets the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 11 – Plots 11A, 11B and 11C
Roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii, 40%) and sweet vernal grass
(Anthoxanthum odoratum, 15%) were identified in Plot 11A. Sweet vernal
grass is a herbaceous species and roughleaf dogwood is a tree. Roughleaf
dogwood has a wetland indicator status of FAC. Sweet vernal grass has a
wetland indicator of FACU. Tree species are present within this plot in
