SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
“scatter” of wetland indicator status for observed plant species is wide.
Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is not
comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore,
Plot 3C does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 4 – Plots 4A and 4B
Barley (Hordeum vulgare, 80%) and morning glory (Ipomoea cairica, 10%)
were identified in Plot 4A. Barley is a herbaceous species and morning glory
is a vine. Barley is not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in
Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). However, other species of the genus
Hordeum have wetland indicators that range from FAC+ to FACW-. Morning
glory is listed, but does not have an assigned wetland indicator status.
Given that plants belonging to the same genus as barley are wetter than
FAC and barley comprises 80% of the observed plant species in the plot, Plot
4A appears to meet the hydrophytic criteria. Although, it is important to
note that the majority of the vegetation in Plot 4A was dead, it appeared
that the adjacent soybean field had been recently sprayed with a herbicide.
Rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides, 30%), dotted smartweed (Polygonum
punctatum, 30%) and arrowhead (Sagittaria ambigua, 30%) were identified
in Plot 4B. All observed species are herbaceous. Each of the three identified
species has a wetland indicator status of OBL. Therefore, Plot 4B meets the
hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 5 – Plots 5A and 5B
Rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides, 40%), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida,
25%) and prairie dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum, 25%) were identified in
Plot 5A. All observed species are herbaceous. Rice cutgrass has an
indicator status of OBL. Giant ragweed has an indicator status of FAC+.
Prairie dogbane has an indicator status of FAC. Estimates of species’
dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is comprised of plants with
