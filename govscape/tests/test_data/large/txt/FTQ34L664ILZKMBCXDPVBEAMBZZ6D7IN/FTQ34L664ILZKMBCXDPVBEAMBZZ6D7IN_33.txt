Discussion of Wetlands
ditches help to remove excess water, as it dries out slowly after rains.
Permeability and surface runoff are very slow in Wabash soils. The seasonal
high water table commonly is within 1 foot of ground surface during winter
and spring.
Leta (silty clay, map unit #66007), Knox (silty clay loam, map unit #10063;
silt loam 5-9% slopes, map unit #10055 and silt loam 14-20% slopes, map
unit #10041) and Landes (fine sandy loam, map unit #36023) soils account
for minor areas, in terms of soil dominance within the facility property. Leta
soils are deep, nearly level, somewhat poorly-drained and located on
Missouri River floodplains. It is protected by levees, but occasionally floods
during levee breaks or overflow of local tributaries. The surface layer is
typically very dark gray, firm silty clay (5 inches thick). The subsurface
layer is also very dark gray, firm silty clay (7 inches thick). The subsoil is
about 13 inches thick, and is a very dark grayish-brown, mottled, firm silty
clay with strata of dark grayish-brown silt loam. The substratum extends to
a depth of 60 inches or more. The upper part is stratified dark grayish-
brown and very dark grayish-brown. It is mottled, very friable, very fine
sandy loam. The lower part of the substratum is stratified dark grayish-
brown and brown, mottled, friable silt loam and very fine sandy loam. Most
areas of the Leta soils are used for cultivated crops (soybeans, grain
sorghum, corn and winter wheat). Surface runoff is slow. The surface is
covered by water after heavy rainfall or by runoff from adjacent areas. Land
grading, shallow surface drains and open ditches help to remove the excess
surface water. Permeability is slow in the clayey upper part of the Leta soils,
and moderate in the loamy lower part. The seasonal high water table
commonly is at a depth of 1 to 3 feet below ground surface during winter
and spring.
Knox silty clay loam soils are deep, strongly sloping and well-drained. These
soils are on the convex side slopes of the uplands bordering the Missouri
River floodplain. The surface layer is typically brown, friable silty clay loam
