Discussion of Wetlands
present. The soil at Plot 10B was very dry and very hard. Plot 10B was
established within the apparent drainageway.
Plot 10C contained silt/clay at a depth of 0 to 12 inches bgs. The soil was
very dark gray (10YR 3/1), and did not display mottling. Refusal was
encountered at a depth of 12 inches bgs. The soil in Plot 10C was very dry.
Similar to Plot 10A, Plot 10C was established upslope of the apparent
drainageway.
Plot 10A did not display features characteristic of hydric soil. Plots 10B and
10C did contain chroma matrix colors of 1, although no mottles were
present. Soils of this area, Bremer silty clay loam, are listed on the local
Hydric Soils List. Field observations did not confirm the Bremer mapped
type, as Bremer soils are characterized as having mottles. However,
characteristics of the observed soils did match those of the Leta inclusion.
Potential Wetland Area 11 â€“ Plots 11A, 11B and 11C
Similar to Plot area 10, Plot points 11A, 11B and 11C were established
adjacent to and within an apparent drainageway between two soybean
fields. Plots 11A and 11C were established upslope of the drainageway, and
Plot 11B was established within the apparent drainageway.
The soil at Plot 11A consisted of topsoil at a depth of 0 to 8 inches bgs.
Refusal was encountered at a depth of 8 inches bgs. The soil was very dry
and compact. Plot 11A was established approximately 2-3 feet upslope of
the base of the apparent drainageway.
Plot 11B contained silty clay throughout the soil probe (0-16 inches bgs).
The soil was black (7.5YR 2.5/1) throughout. Mottling was present at a
depth of 12 inches bgs, and continued through the base of the soil probe.
The mottles were reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) and pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2).
They were many, distinct and coarse. The soil at Plot 11B was dry and
