SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Zone and may pond water for periods long enough to create wetland
hydrology. The majority of the facility property is within the 100 Year Flood
Zone. According to the Carroll County, Missouri FEMA flood maps, the base
flood elevations for the facility property range from 687 to 690 feet NGVD
from east to west. According to the USGS 1978 Norborne, Missouri 7.5
Minute Series Quadrangle Topographic Map, the facility property ranges in
elevation from 675 feet to 685 feet NGVD. Northern portions of the facility
property, where elevations are higher, lie outside of the 100 Year Flood
Zone, in areas of minimal flooding.
Review of US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory
Maps
The hydrology investigation also included review of the USFWS NWI map
(Figure 8). Within the project facility, the noted wetlands are primarily
classified as palustrine, emergent. These FWS-mapped areas are scattered
throughout the facility property. It is important to note that the FWS
wetland classification system requires that a positive indicator of wetlands
be present for only one of the three parameters, while the COE 1987 Manual
requires that positive indicators for each of the three parameters be present
to classify an area as a wetland.
Potential Wetland Area 1 â€“ Plots 1A, 1B and 1C
Plot area 1 was established adjacent to the railroad which traverses the
southern boundary of the facility property. Plot points 1A, 1B and 1C were
arranged so that they traversed the vegetated area between the railroad and
county road. Plot 1A was located at a higher edge of the railroad
embankment where there were no signs of inundation or saturation. Plot 1B
was located within a depressional area, downslope of the railroad track. This
area could have a potential to accumulate water in rain events or flooding.
Plot 1C was located between Plot 1B and the county road, in a depressional
area that could potentially receive runoff from the county road in heavy rain
events. No indicators of wetland hydrology, such as drift lines, drainage
