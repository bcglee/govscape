SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
the suspected wetland areas at the subject site was compared to the
National List of Plant Species That Occur in Wetlands: North Central (Region
3) (USFWS, 1988), to determine its hydrophytic classification. According to
the COE 1987 Manual, the hydrophytic vegetation wetland parameter may
also be satisfied if the plants present display morphological, reproductive or
physiological adaptations to wet environments, or if there is visual
observation of plant species growing in areas of inundation or prolonged soil
saturation. Table 1 of this report lists the plant species identified on site,
along with their respective wetland indicator status.
Identification of plants was somewhat difficult for this delineation effort
because most of the observed species were not flowering. The timing of the
field investigation occurred after the spring flowering event and too early for
much of the summer flowering event. Thirty-six dominant plant species
were identified in the established plots. Figure 3 presents the locations of
the potential wetland plots examined throughout the facility property.
The percent dominance values presented below are total dominance values
(i.e., the percent total coverage for each plant species identified within the
subject plot). Thus, to determine whether at least 50% of the present
species were of hydrophytic character, per COE requirements, it was
necessary to examine the species-specific dominance percentages in an
additive manner. For example, a plot may have had only 60% of its surface
vegetated (the total of the dominance percentages noted in this report).
However, if 50% or more of that vegetation was determined to meet the
criteria for wetland vegetation, then the plot met the same hydrophytic
vegetation criteria set out by the COE 1987 Manual.
Determination of whether an individual plot met the hydrophytic criteria was
subjective at times, as many of the identified vegetative species did not
have an assigned wetland indicator in the National List of Plants that Occur
in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3), and indicators from related, surrogate
species were used.
