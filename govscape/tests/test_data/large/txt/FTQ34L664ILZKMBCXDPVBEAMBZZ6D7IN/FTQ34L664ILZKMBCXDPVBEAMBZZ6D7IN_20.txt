SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
herbaceous. Yellow nutsedge, one of the more dominant species observed
in Plot 2B (40% dominance), is not listed in the National List of Plants that
Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). However, other species of the
Cyperus genus are listed. Their wetland indicators range from FACU- to
OBL. Pennsylvania smartweed (40%) has a wetland indicator of FACW+.
Nipple-wort (10%) is not listed. Sawtooth sunflower (1%) has a wetland
indicator of FACW-. Tall ironweed (1%) has a wetland indicator of FAC. The
“scatter” of wetland indicator status for observed plant species is wide.
Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is
comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore,
Plot 2B meets the hydrophytic criteria.
Wild oat (Avena fatua, 70%), tall ironweed (Vernonia gigantea, 20%) and
fleabane (Erigeron canadensis, 5%) were identified in Plot 2C. All observed
species are herbaceous. Wild oat, the most dominant observed plant
species in Plot 2C, is not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in
Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). Tall ironweed (20%) has a wetland
indicator of FAC. Fleabane (5%) is not listed; however, other listed species
of the genus Erigeron have wetland indicators that range from FACU to
FACW. Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that 50% of the plot is not
comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore,
Plot 2C does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 3 – Plots 3A, 3B and 3C
Thistle (Carduus nutans, 30%), nipple-wort (Lapsana communis, 30%) and
sandbar willow (Salix exigua, 30%) were identified in Plot 3A. Thistle and
nipple-wort are herbaceous, while sandbar willow is a sapling/shrub. Thistle
and nipple-wort are not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in
Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). Sandbar willow has a wetland indicator
status of OBL. Given that two species comprising approximately two-thirds
of the plants present in Plot 3A are not listed and Plot 3A was established in
an upland area immediately adjacent to railroad tracks, this plot likely does
