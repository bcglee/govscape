Discussion of Wetlands
(4 inches thick). It is a mixture of subsoil material and surface soil material.
The subsoil is dark yellowish-brown, friable, firm silty clay loam (50 inches
thick). The upper part is firm, and the lower part is mottled and friable. The
substratum extends to a depth of 60 inches or more, and is dark yellowish-
brown, mottled, friable silt loam. Most areas of this soil are used for
cultivated crops, hay or pasture. Permeability is moderate and surface
runoff is rapid.
Knox silt loam soils are deep, well-drained and moderately sloping. These
soils occur on ridgetops and side slopes in the uplands bordering Missouri
River floodplains. The surface layer is typically very dark grayish-brown,
friable silt loam (6 inches thick). The subsoil is brown and dark yellowish-
brown, firm silty clay loam with mottling in the lower part (40 inches thick).
The substratum extends to a depth of 60 inches or more, and is brown,
mottled, friable silt loam. Permeability is moderate and surface runoff is
medium. Most areas of this soil are used for cultivated crops, pasture or
hay. A small acreage is used for woodland.
Landes fine sandy loam soils are deep, nearly level, well-drained and in
slightly higher areas of the Missouri River floodplain. The surface layer is
typically very dark grayish brown, very friable fine sandy loam (7 inches
thick). The subsurface layer is very dark grayish brown, friable find sandy
loam (13 inches thick). The subsoil is brown, friable loamy fine sand (13
inches thick). The substratum extends to a depth of 60 inches or more, and
is brown and dark yellowish brown with mottles. Permeability is rapid and
surface runoff is slow. The seasonal high water table is commonly at 4 to 6
feet below ground surface during winter and spring. Most areas of these
soils are used for cultivated crops (corn, soybeans and small grain).
According to the Hydric Soils List for Carroll County, the Booker, Bremer,
Wabash, Leta and Landes soils are classified as hydric soil (soil that
developed anaerobic conditions, usually due to water saturation or flooding
present for long durations in the growing season).
