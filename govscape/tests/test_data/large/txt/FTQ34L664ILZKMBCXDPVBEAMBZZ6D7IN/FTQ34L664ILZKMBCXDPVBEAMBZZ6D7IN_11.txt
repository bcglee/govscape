length, and includes the area directly south of the facility property. Corridor
Alternatives #2 and #3 would link the facility property to the BNSF rail line
to the north. Corridor Alternative #2 is known as the “East Connection”, and
Corridor Alternative #3 is known as the west connection. Corridor
Alternative #2 measures approximately 6.8 miles in length. A significant
portion of Wakenda Creek lies within Corridor Alternative #2. This corridor
would meet the BNSF rail line just south of where the rail line intersects
Wakenda Creek. Corridor Alternative #3 measures approximately 7.2 miles
in length. A significant portion of the Wakenda Creek West Fork lies within
Corridor Alternative #3. Corridor Alternative #3 would meet the BNSF rail
line at a location south of Corridor Alternative #2. Corridor Alternative #3
extends from Carroll County, Missouri into Ray County, Missouri. Each of
the three corridor alternatives measures one mile wide. The exact location
of the rail line within the corridor will be determined based on consideration
of engineering and environmental factors.
