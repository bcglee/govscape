Discussion of Wetlands
an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore, Plot 5A meets the
hydrophytic criteria.
Dotted smartweed (Polygonum punctatum, 45%) and arrowhead (Sagittaria
ambigua, 45%) were identified in Plot 5B. Both species are herbaceous.
Both species have a wetland indicator status of OBL. Therefore, Plot 5B
meets the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 6 – Plot 6A
False flax (Camelina microcarpa, 60%), Pennsylvania smartweed
(Polygonum pensylvanicum, 30%) and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti,
10%) were identified in Plot 6A. All observed species are herbaceous. False
flax is not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North
Central, Region 3). However, another species of the Camelina genus is
listed and has a wetland indicator of FAC-. Pennsylvania smartweed has an
indicator status of FACW+. Velvetleaf has an indicator status of FACU-.
Estimates of species’ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the plot is not
comprised of plants with an indicator status of FAC or wetter. Therefore,
Plot 6A does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 7 – Plot 7A
Prairie dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum, 30%), rice cutgrass (Leersia
oryzoides, 20%), fleabane (Erigeron canadensis, 15%), silver maple (Acer
saccharinum, 10%) and wild morning glory (Convolvulus sepium, 10%) were
identified in Plot 7A. Prairie dogbane, rice cutgrass and fleabane are
herbaceous species. Silver maple is a tree. Wild morning glory is a vine.
Prairie dogbane (30%) has a wetland indicator status of FAC. Rice cutgrass
(20%) has an indicator status of OBL. Fleabane (15%) is not listed in the
National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3).
However, other members of the Erigeron genus have wetland indicators that
range from FACU to FACW. Silver maple (10%) has an indicator status of
FACW. Wild morning glory (10%) is not listed. Estimates of species’
