property extends into an area comprised of soils of the Knox-Higginsville-
Wakenda association. Soils of this association are characterized as deep,
gently sloping to steep, well-drained and somewhat poorly-drained soils that
formed in a thick layer of loess. Soils of this association occur on uplands.
Knox soils comprise about 31 percent of the Knox-Higginsville-Wakenda
association. Knox soils are well-drained, and are located on narrow
ridgetops and convex side slopes. Higginsville and similar soils comprise 30
percent of the association. These soils are somewhat poorly-drained, and
are in concave areas on side slopes. Wakenda and similar soils, comprising
29 percent of the Knox-Higginsville-Wakenda association, are well-drained.
They are on ridgetops, convex side slopes and high stream terraces. Other
minor soils comprise 10 percent of the Knox-Higginsville-Wakenda
association.
The Carroll County soil survey identifies the following detailed soil map units
within the facility property (arranged in approximate order of dominance
within the facility property):
13598 Booker silty clay
13507 Bremer silty clay
36046 Wabash silty clay
66007 Leta silty clay
10063 Knox silty clay loam, 9-14% slopes
10055 Knox silt loam, 5-9% slopes
36023 Landes fine sandy loam
10041 Knox silt loam, 14-20% slopes
Booker soils (silty clay, map unit #13598) comprise a vast majority of the
facility property area (Figure 4). Booker soils, which are deep, nearly level
and very poorly-drained, are in broad areas on the Missouri River floodplain.
The soil is protected by levees, but is occasionally flooded due to levee
breaks or as a result of overflow from local tributaries. It is commonly
ponded after heavy rains. The surface layer is typically black, very firm silty
clay (5 inches thick). The subsoil extends to a depth of 60 inches or more,
and is a very firm clay. The upper part is black (7 inches thick), and the
