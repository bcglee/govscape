Discussion of Wetlands
lower part is very dark gray and gray, with mottling. Nearly all of the
Booker acreage is used for cultivated crops (soybeans, corn and small
grain). It is best suited to row crops that require a short growing season, as
permeability is very low in the Booker soils. Surface runoff is very slow or
ponded. The seasonal high water table commonly is 0.5 foot above the
surface to 1.0 foot below ground surface during winter and spring. Root
development is restricted by poor aeration.
Bremer (silty clay, map unit #13507) and Wabash (silty clay, map unit
#36046) soils comprise the second most acreage within the facility property.
Similar to the Booker soils, Bremer soils are deep, nearly level, poorly-
drained, on the Missouri River floodplain, protected by levees, but
occasionally flooded. The surface layer is typically black, firm silty clay loam
(12 inches thick). The subsoil extends to a depth of 60 inches or more. The
upper part is very dark gray, mottled and very firm silty clay. The next layer
is dark grayish-brown, mottled and very firm silty clay. The lower part is a
grayish-brown, mottled, firm silty clay loam. Most areas of Bremer soils are
used for cultivated crops (corn, soybeans, grain sorghum and small grain).
Permeability is moderately slow and surface runoff is slow in the Bremer
soils. Land grading, shallow surface drains and open ditches helps to
remove the excess water. The seasonal high water table commonly is 1 to 2
feet below ground surface during winter and spring.
Like the Booker soils, and similar to the Bremer soils, Wabash soils are deep,
nearly level and very poorly-drained. These soils are on floodplains of
Missouri River tributaries, and occasionally flooded. The surface layer is
typically very dark gray, firm silty clay (4 inches thick). The subsurface
layer is very dark gray, very firm silty clay (10 inches thick). The subsoil
extends to a depth of 60 inches, and is very firm silty clay. The upper part
is black, and the lower part is dark grayish brown and mottled. Most areas
of Wabash soils are used for cultivated crops (corn, soybeans, grain
sorghum and small grain). Land grading, shallow surface drains and open
