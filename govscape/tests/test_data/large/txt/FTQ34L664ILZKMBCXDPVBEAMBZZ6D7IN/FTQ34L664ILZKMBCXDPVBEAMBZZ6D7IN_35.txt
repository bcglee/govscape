SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
It is important to note that a majority, if not all, of the soils within the
facility property have been disturbed by past and current farming,
construction of roads and establishment of drainage ditches and drainage
ways. These soils within the facility property are also protected from the
Missouri River by a levee system. Hydric soils that may have occurred prior
to human disturbance would not be expected to continue unless they were
exposed to the appropriate moisture regime. In this field investigation, the
hydric soils parameter was based on the relative ability of the local soil to
“express” hydric character. A soil probe was advanced to a target depth of
16 inches below ground surface (bgs) for each plot point. Observations
gathered during sampling of soils within each of the potential wetland plots
for the facility property are discussed below.
Potential Wetland Area 1 – Plots 1A, 1B and 1C
Plot points 1A, 1B and 1C were established adjacent to one another, with
Plots 1A and 1C flanking Plot 1B. Plot 1A was established upland, while Plots
1B and 1C were at a lower elevation.
The soil at Plot 1A consisted of silt with sand to a depth of approximately 2
inches bgs, underlain by sand with silt (2-9 inches bgs). The sand with silt
was dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2). No mottles were present. The sand
did not display organic streaking, nor was an organic pan observed within
the top 16 inches of ground surface. Organic streaking and the presence of
organic pans can be characteristic of hydric sandy soils. Refusal was
encountered at a depth of 12 inches bgs. Rock was observed from 9 to 12
inches bgs. The soil at Plot 1A was very dry and appeared to be fill material.
Plot 1A was established at the upland edge of a railroad embankment.
Plot 1B contained silt with sand near the surface (1-6 inches bgs), followed
by sand and silt. The silt with sand was black (10YR 2/1), and did not
contain mottles. The underlying sand and silt (6-10 inches bgs) was also
black (10YR 2/1) without mottles. The soil at Plot 1B was dry and very
