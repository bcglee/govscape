SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
several stages of maturity, ranging from saplings to trees with a diameter at
breast height of several feet. Due to the immaturity of several of the
saplings, it was difficult to identify these species with certainty. Of the two
species identified in Plot 11A, at least 50% of those were comprised of a
species with a wetland indicator status of FAC. Therefore, Plot 11A meets
the hydrophytic criteria.
Roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii, 20%) was identified at Plot 11B.
Roughleaf dogwood is a tree. No ground vegetation was present in this
area, only overhead canopy cover from trees. The wetland indicator status
for roughleaf dogwood is FAC. Given that this was the only identified species
present in the plot, Plot 11B meets the hydrophytic criteria.
Cinquefoil (Potentilla canadensis, 40%), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus
drummondii, 20%) and sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum, 10%)
were identified in Plot 11C. Sweet vernal grass is a herbaceous species,
roughleaf dogwood is a tree and cinquefoil is a vine. Cinquefoil (40%) is not
listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central,
Region 3). However, other listed species of the Potentilla genus have
wetland indicator statuses ranging from FACU- to OBL. Roughleaf dogwood
(20%) has an indicator status of FAC. Sweet vernal grass (10%) has an
indicator status of FACU. This plot is almost completely shaded with canopy
cover. Estimates of speciesâ€™ dominance indicate that at least 50% of the
plant species present in this plot do not have an indicator status of FAC or
wetter. Therefore, Plot 11C does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
