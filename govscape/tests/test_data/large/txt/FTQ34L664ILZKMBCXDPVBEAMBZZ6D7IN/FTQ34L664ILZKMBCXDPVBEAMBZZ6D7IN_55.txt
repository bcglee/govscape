SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Standing water was observed at the southeast quadrant at the intersection
of County Roads JJ and 300. Based on the vegetation growth patterns, it
appeared as though the areas immediately surrounding the culvert pipes at
the road intersections hold the most water with the greatest frequency.
Potential Wetland Area 10 – Plots 10A, 10B and 10C
Plot area 10 was established within a corridor, measuring approximately 50
feet wide, between two soybean fields. The corridor was somewhat
vegetated, with much tree cover. There was a depressional area within the
center of this corridor that appeared to have the potential to carry water at
times. Plot 10A was located within the corridor, east and upland of the
depressional area. No obvious water marks nor drift lines were observed at
Plot 10A. Plot 10B was located with the depressional area. There was little
to no vegetation on the ground here, although, the area was nearly
completely shaded with tree cover. Moss and darker coloration was present
at the bases of the trees in Plot 10B (i.e., water marks). Drainage patterns
and water-stained leaves were also observed here. Plot 10C was located
west and upland of the depressional area. Groundcover was somewhat
sparse here, but there was much overhead canopy cover. There were no
readily apparent drift lines or water marks at Plot 10C. Plots 10A and 10C
did not meet the hydrology criteria. Indicators of wetland hydrology were
observed at Plot 10B; therefore, Plot 10B met the hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 11 – Plots 11A, 11B and 11C
Plot area 11 was established adjacent to a drainageway within a cultivated
soybean field. Plot 11A was located approximately 2-3 feet upland of the
drainageway, above the cut of the bank. Indicators of wetland hydrology
were not present at Plot 11A. Plot 11B was located within the drainageway.
No ground vegetation was present in this area, only overhead canopy cover
from trees. Drainage patterns and water-stained leaves were evident at Plot
11B. Plot 11C was located upslope of the drainageway, at an elevation
equivalent to that of Plot 11A. Plot 11C was located above the cut of the
