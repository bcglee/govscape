4/6), few, distinct and medium. Plot 4B was established immediately
adjacent to the drainage ditch.
Plots 4A and 4B displayed features characteristic of hydric soil, such as
gleyed and low chroma matrix color and mottling. Soils of this area, Booker
silty clay, are also listed on the local Hydric Soils List. Field observations for
Plot 4B soils generally confirmed the mapped type; however soils observed
at Plot 4A did not match the description for Booker soils, nor its inclusions.
Potential Wetland Area 5 â€“ Plots 5A and 5B
Similar to Plot 4, Plot points 5A and 5B were established adjacent to a
drainage ditch running through a cultivated soybean field. Plot 5A was
upland of Plot 5B.
The surface soil at Plot 5A consisted of clay with silt and trace sand (0-2
inches bgs), and was very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1). The surface layer was
underlain by very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) clay. The clay layer extended from 2
inches bgs to 16 inches bgs. Mottling was present throughout the 2-16 inch
bgs depth. The mottles were few, faint, medium and yellowish red (5YR
5/6) in color. The soil moisture at Plot 5A increased with depth. Plot 5A was
established on a downward slope leading from the soybean field to the
drainage ditch.
Plot 5B soils consisted of clay with silt throughout the entire soil probe (0-16
inches bgs). The clay was dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) at a depth of 0 to 5
inches bgs. At a depth of 5 inches bgs, the soil color changed to very dark
gray (10YR 3/1). Yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottling was observed
throughout the soil probe. The mottles were few, distinct and medium. The
soil was saturated throughout. Plot 5B was established immediately
adjacent to the drainage ditch.
Plots 5A and 5B displayed the low chroma matrix colors and mottling
characteristic of hydric soil. Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are also
