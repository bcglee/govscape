and 11C did not meet the hydrology criteria. Plot 11B did meet the
hydrology criteria.
Corridor Alternatives #1, #2 and #3
Alternative Corridor #1 extends south of the facility property, approximately
one mile beyond the BNSF and NS railroads. This area, like that of the
facility property, has a general elevation of 675 feet NGVD. As stated
earlier, the USGS topographical maps indicate that an agricultural levee
exists along the north bank of the Missouri River, in the vicinity of the study
area. The USGS 1978 Hardin, 1979 Stet and 1979 Roads, Missouri 7.5
Minute Series Quadrangle Topographic Maps were reviewed for Alternative
Corridors #2 and #3, which lie north of the facility property (Figure 6).
Alternative Corridors #2 and #3 lie within the area of higher elevation, north
of the facility property. These areas obviously do not have a potential for
flooding from the Missouri River. However, Wakenda Creek and the
Wakenda Creek West Fork traverse these two corridors. These creeks have
associated floodplain areas, as shown on the USGS topographical maps. The
general elevations in the areas of Alternative Corridors #2 and #3 range
from 700 feet NGVD to 800 feet NGVD.
According to the FEMA Firm Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Carroll and Ray
Counties (Figure 7), Alternative Corridor #1 lies entirely within the 100
Year Flood Zone. The portion of Alternative Corridor #2 comprised by
Wakenda Creek and its floodplain lies within the 100 Year Flood Zone. The
remainder of Alternative Corridor #2 is within an area of minimal flooding.
For Alternative Corridor #3, the areas immediately associated with the
Wakenda Creek West Fork and its floodplain and an unnamed creek in the
southern portion of Alternative Corridor #3 are within the 100 Year Flood
Zone. The remainder of Alternative Corridor #3 is within an area of minimal
flooding. Of the three Alternative Corridor routes, Alternative Corridor #3
contains the least land area within the 100 Year Flood Zone.
