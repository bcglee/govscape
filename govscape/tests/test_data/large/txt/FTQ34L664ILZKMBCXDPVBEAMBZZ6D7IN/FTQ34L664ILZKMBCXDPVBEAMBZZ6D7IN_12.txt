SECTION TWO
Methodology
2.1 AREAS UNDER CORPS OF ENGINEERS JURISDICTION
Routinely, the process of conducting a wetlands investigation and
determination involves gathering preliminary information and conducting a
field investigation to identify the presence of wetlands subject to U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers jurisdiction. The process begins by utilizing existing
government agency information and data from other sources to identify
potentially significant areas. This information is then compiled and used to
screen the project area via visual reconnaissance.
A visual reconnaissance was performed throughout the entire project area to
highlight: a) the various wetland delineation methods to be employed, b)
potential wetland areas and c) potential non-wetland areas. This first step
identified problematic areas, as well as indicated appropriate strategies to be
utilized in these areas under the different mapping protocols outlined in the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) 1987 Wetland Delineation Manual
(1987 Manual).
2.2 FIELD WORK FOR WETLAND DETERMINATION
Potential wetlands were field examined throughout the approximately 1,500
acre area which comprises the facility property. Fieldwork utilized the
wetland mapping and identification protocols of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers in all areas.
The online version of the COE Wetlands Delineation Manual, January 1987
(Technical Report Y-87-1), as well as COE Regulatory Guidance Letters and
Memoranda were utilized for the study area. Despite the large size of the
facility property, the character and distribution of potential wetlands within
the investigated area suggested that the Routine Method for areas less than
five acres in size was the most appropriate. This method is based on the size
of potential wetlands found on site, rather than the size of the property.
