Discussion of Wetlands
and compact throughout. Plot 2B was established in a depressional area,
between Plot points 2A and 2C.
Plot 2C contained topsoil at a depth of 0 to 1 inches bgs. Clay with trace
sand was observed at 1 to 16 inches bgs. The clay was black (2.5Y 2.5/1).
Mottling was present throughout. Mottle color was yellowish red (5YR 4/6).
Mottles were few, distinct and fine. Soil at Plot 2C was dry and compact;
however, it did display more moisture at a depth of 12 inches bgs. Plot 2C
was established in a depressional area adjacent to a county road.
Plots 2A, 2B and 2C did contain low chroma matrix colors and mottles,
features characteristic of hydric soil. Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are
also listed on the local Hydric Soils List. Field observations generally confirm
the mapped type.
Potential Wetland Area 3 â€“ Plots 3A, 3B and 3C
Like Plot areas 1 and 2, Plot points 3A, 3B and 3C were established adjacent
to a railroad line, with Plot 3A being upland, and Plots 3B and 3C at a lower
elevation.
The soil at Plot 3A consisted of sand with some rock at a depth of 0 to 8
inches bgs. This was underlain by rock. The sand at the surface was loose
and dry. Plot 3A was established near the top of a slope leading down from
a railroad line.
Plot 3B contained topsoil at the surface (0-1 inches bgs), followed by clay
with silt (1-16 inches bgs). The clay with silt was black (7.5YR 2.5/1), with
dark smearing. The color of the clay changed at a depth of 10 inches bgs to
dark brown (7.5YR 3/2). Mottling was also observed at this depth. The
mottles were strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), many, distinct and medium. Soil at
Plot 3B was very dry. Plot 3B was established in a depressional area,
between Plot points 3A and 3C.
