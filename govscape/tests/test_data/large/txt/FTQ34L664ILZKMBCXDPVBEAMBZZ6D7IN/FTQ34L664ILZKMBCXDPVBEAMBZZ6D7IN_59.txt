Delineation of Wetlands

fringes associated with drainageways traversing the farmed fields. Table 3
presents acreage values for the “Jurisdictional Wetlands” and the linear
“Waters of the United States” identified within the facility property.
Observations were made at eleven plot locations within the facility property.
Plots 4B, 5B and 11B were determined to be wetland. Wetland areas were
observed within the portions of the drainage ditches immediately adjacent to
the culvert pipes at the road intersections. However, these areas are
isolated, and, therefore, would not fall under COE jurisdiction. The
remaining plot locations that were examined by field personnel were
determined to be non-wetland, due to the lack of one or more wetland field
indicators (hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soil and wetland hydrology).
Plot areas 1, 2 and 3 were established adjacent to the Norfolk Southern rail
line at the southern edge of the facility property. This area is sloped and
consists of a railroad embankment which leads down to a county road. A
variety of volunteer vegetative species inhabit this corridor. Slight
depressional areas exist at the base of the railroad embankment and directly
adjacent to the county road. The mapped soil in this area is Booker silty
clay of the Bremer-Cotter-Booker association. The Booker soils are classified
as hydric. None of the plots within these areas met all three wetland
criteria. Some of the plots met the hydrophytic vegetation parameter and/or
the hydric soil parameter. However, none of these plots displayed the
necessary indicators for wetland hydrology.
Plot areas 4, 5, 7 and 8 were established adjacent to the Norborne Drainage
Ditch. This ditch traverses a series of farmed soybean fields. Plots 4B and
5B were identified as wetland areas. Each of these plots was located directly
adjacent to the drainage ditch, where soil was saturated to at least one inch
within ground surface. Vegetation and soils identified at Plots 4B and 5B
were indicative of wet conditions. Only one plot point was advanced at Plot
area 7. Plot 7A was not identified as a wetland, as it was established above
the cut of the bank. A wetland fringe, extending from the water’s edge to
