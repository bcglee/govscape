Delineation of Wetlands
SECTION FOUR
and Waters of the United States
4.1 WETLAND DELINEATION RESULTS
The land features and areas suspect as wetlands were evaluated based on
the criteria set forth in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1987 Wetland
Delineation Manual. In brief, each plot was examined for the three
parameters: hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils and wetland hydrology. All
three parameters must be met in order for the area to be considered a
wetland. Table 2 presents the wetland determination results for the plots
examined in the August 2006 investigation, based upon their satisfaction of
the three parameters. “Jurisdictional Wetlands” refers to areas, which meet
the criteria for the Clean Water Act Section 404 definition of a wetland.
According to the COE, areas not hydrologically connected to navigable
surface waters should not be classified as “Jurisdictional Wetlands”, nor
should they be classified as “Waters of the United States”.
The facility property lies approximately six miles north of the Missouri River,
within the Missouri River floodplain. According to the Carroll County NRCS
soil survey, the Missouri River floodplain is nearly level, and measures about
nine miles wide at the widest point. The Missouri River is the largest stream
in the region. Wakenda Creek and its tributaries drain most of the western
portion of Carroll County, the southern portion of the uplands and the
northern part of the bottomlands. Wakenda Creek flows eastward toward
the Missouri River.
Despite its position within the Missouri River floodplain, a majority of the
areas within the facility property do not meet the three parameters
necessary for an area to be designated a jurisdictional wetland. Levees
protect the land adjacent to the river. Additionally, nearly all of the facility
property is cultivated and farmed. Thus, water for much of the area is
actively diverted and the land drained. Furthermore, according to Missouri
River gage data, all portions of the facility property are saturated/inundated
for less than 5% to 12.5% of the growing season. The only areas that
qualify as jurisdictional wetlands within the facility property are wetland
