SECTION FIVE
Conclusions
A preliminary jurisdictional wetland delineation was performed on an area
associated with the planned construction of a coal-fired generation unit in
Carroll County, Missouri. This site is located near Norborne, Missouri. Field
work was performed on August 1-3, 2006 to determine the presence and
extent of Clean Water Act Section 404 “Waters of the United States”,
including “Jurisdictional Wetlands”. Based upon the onsite jurisdictional
wetland delineation and a review of existing information, it is determined
that an estimated 3.5 acres of “Waters of the United States” occur within the
facility limits of the project site, with 2.9 acres of that area consisting of
“Jurisdictional Wetlands”.
The constructed generation unit would also require access to the two nearby
existing rail lines. Three alternative routing corridors have been identified,
and a desktop, screening level survey of potential wetland impacts
associated with each of the corridor alternatives was conducted. Based on a
review of published data and field observations gathered during a drive-by
survey, it appears that each of the three proposed corridors contain potential
wetland areas.
The visual screening level assessment, together with a review of
documented information, revealed the following information about the three
proposed alternative corridors. Alternative Corridor #1 contains soils of the
Bremer-Cotter-Booker association. These soils are characterized as deep,
nearly level, well-drained, poorly-drained and very poorly-drained soils that
formed in alluvium. These soils occur on floodplains. Bremer and Booker
soils comprise a majority of the area within Alternative Corridor #1. These
soils are classified as hydric. Alternative Corridor #1, the southernmost
corridor, does not contain major drainageways, as do the two other
corridors. Alternative Corridor #1 also contains the least amount of
potential wooded wetland, as forested areas are mainly located along
drainageways in this region. Alternative Corridor #1 is located in an area of
lower topography (elevations range from 675 to 685 feet NGVD), within the
