SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Plot 1B is not dominated by hydrophytic vegetation, thus, this plot does not
meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Wild oat (Avena fatua, 80%), fleabane (Erigeron canadensis, 10%) and
barley (Hordeum vulgare, 5%) were identified in Plot 1C. All observed
species are herbaceous. Wild oat, the most dominant plant species in Plot
1C, is not listed in the National List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North
Central, Region 3). Fleabane and barley also do not have listed wetland
indicators. However, other species of the Erigeron and Hordeum genuses
are listed. Their wetland indicators range from FACW to FACU and FACW- to
FAC+, respectively. Given that the highly predominant species in Plot 1C is
not listed, nor are any representatives of its genus, Plot 1C does not meet
the hydrophytic criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 2 – Plots 2A, 2B and 2C
Nipple-wort (Lapsana communis, 50%), yellow nutsedge (Cyperus
esculentus, 40%) and common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca, 5%) were
identified in Plot 2A. All observed species are herbaceous. Nipple-wort, the
most dominant plant species identified at Plot 2A is not listed in the National
List of Plants that Occur in Wetlands (North Central, Region 3). The two
remaining species identified in Plot 2A (yellow nutsedge and common
milkweed) were also not listed. However, other species of the Cyperus and
Asclepias genuses are listed. Their wetland indicators range from FACU- to
OBL and UPL to OBL, respectively. The “scatter” of wetland indicator status
for observed plant species is wide. Estimates of species’ dominance indicate
that 50% of the plot is not comprised of plants with an indicator status of
FAC or wetter. Therefore, Plot 2A does not meet the hydrophytic criteria.
Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus, 40%), Pennsylvania smartweed
(Polygonum pensylvanicum, 40%), nipple-wort (Lapsana communis, 10%),
sawtooth sunflower (Helianthus grosserserratus, 1%) and tall ironweed
(Vernonia gigantea, 1%) were identified in Plot 2B. All observed species are
