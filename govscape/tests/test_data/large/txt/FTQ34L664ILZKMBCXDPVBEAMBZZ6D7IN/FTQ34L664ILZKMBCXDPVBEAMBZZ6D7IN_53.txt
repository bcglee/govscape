SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
of the downward slope to the drainage ditch. Plot 4B was located downslope
of Plot 4A, and immediately adjacent to the drainage ditch. The soil at Plot
4A was somewhat moist; however, no signs of wetland hydrology were
observed here. The soil at Plot 4B was saturated to the ground surface. Plot
4A did not meet the hydrology criteria; however, Plot 4B did meet the
hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 5 – Plots 5A and 5B
Plot area 5 was established adjacent to the same drainage ditch as Plot area
4. However, Plot area 5 was located east of Plot area 4. Plot 5A was at an
upland point, on a downward slope leading from the soybean field to the
drainage ditch. Plot 5B was located directly adjacent to the drainage ditch.
Soil at Plot 5B was saturated to within one inch of ground surface. Soils at
Plot 5A were markedly drier, with moisture increasing with depth. Plot 5A
did not meet the hydrology criteria; however, Plot 5B did meet the
hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 6 – Plot 6A
Plot area 6 was established at the convergence of three drainage ditches
within a soybean field on the southern portion of the facility property. A plot
was established here because it appeared to be a depressional area where
water from the converging drainage ditches ponds sufficiently to support
vegetation. The soil moisture increased with depth at Plot 6A, with soil
becoming very moist at a depth of 12 inches bgs. No indicators of wetland
hydrology were observed here, as the soils were not saturated to within 12
inches of ground surface, there were no water marks, drift lines or sediment
deposits. Plot area 6 did not meet the hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 7 – Plot 7A
Plot area 7 was established immediately upslope of a drainage ditch
traversing a soybean field on the southern portion of the facility property.
This is the same drainage ditch that Plot areas 4 and 5 were associated with.
