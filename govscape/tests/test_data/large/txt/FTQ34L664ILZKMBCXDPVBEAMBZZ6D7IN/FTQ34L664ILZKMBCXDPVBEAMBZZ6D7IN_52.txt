patterns or water marks, were observed at Plot area 1. Soils at Plot area 1
were dry, with some moisture displayed at Plot 1C. Plot area 1 did not meet
the hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 2 – Plots 2A, 2B and 2C
As with Plot area 1, Plot area 2 was established adjacent to the Norfolk
Southern railroad. Plot points 2A, 2B and 2C were arranged in the same
fashion as those within Plot area 1, so that they traversed the vegetated
area between the railroad and county road. Plot area 2 was established one-
half to one mile east of Plot area 1. Plot 2A was located at an upland point,
on the slope leading from the railroad embankment. Plot 2B was located in
a depressional area, downslope of the railroad track. Plot 2C was located
between Plot 2B and the county road, in a depressional area sloping down
from the road. No indicators of wetland hydrology were observed at Plot
area 2. Soils at Plot area 2 were, for the most part, dry. Plot area 2 did not
meet the hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 3 – Plots 3A, 3B and 3C
Plot area 3 was established adjacent to the Norfolk Southern railroad,
between Plot areas 1 and 2. Plot 3A was located in an upland area,
immediately adjacent to the railroad track. Plot 3B was located in a
depressional area, downslope of the railroad tracks. The topography at this
location could be conducive to water ponding during heavy rain and/or flood
events. Plot 3C was located immediately adjacent to the county road, at an
elevation slightly lower than the road. No indicators of wetland hydrology
were observed at Plot area 3. Soils at Plot area 3 were dry. Plot area 3 did
not meet the hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 4 – Plots 4A and 4B
Plot area 4 was established adjacent to a drainage ditch which traverses a
cultivated soybean field on the southwestern portion of the facility property.
Plot 4A was located directly adjacent to the soybean field, at the beginning
