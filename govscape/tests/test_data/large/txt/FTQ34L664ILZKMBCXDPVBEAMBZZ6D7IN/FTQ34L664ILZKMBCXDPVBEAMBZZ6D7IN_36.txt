compact. Plot 1B was established in a depressional area, between Plot
points 1A and 1C.
Plot 1C contained topsoil at a depth of 0 to 2 inches bgs. Clay with trace
sand was observed at 2 to 16 inches bgs. The clay was very dark gray (5Y
3/1), and did not display mottles. Soil at Plot 1C did display some moisture,
and was not as dry as the soils observed at Plots 1A and 1B. Plot 1C was
established in a depressional area adjacent to a county road.
Plots 1A and 1B did not contain characteristic features of hydric soil,
whereas Plot 1C contained some hydric features (i.e., matrix chroma of 1).
Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are listed on the local Hydric Soils List.
However, field observations do not confirm the mapped soil type.
Potential Wetland Area 2 â€“ Plots 2A, 2B and 2C
Similar to Plots 1A, 1B and 1C, Plot points 2A, 2B and 2C were established
adjacent to a railroad line, with Plot 2A being upland, and Plots 2B and 2C at
a lower elevation.
The soil at Plot 2A consisted of silt to a depth of approximately 4 inches bgs,
underlain by clay with trace sand. The surface silt was dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2). The clay with trace sand was black (5Y 2.5/1). The clay with
trace sand extended to a depth of 16 inches bgs. Mottles appeared at a
depth of 12 inches bgs. The mottles were brownish yellow (10YR 6/8),
common, distinct and fine. The soil at Plot 2A contained some moisture.
Plot 2A was established near the top of a slope leading down from a railroad
line.
Plot 2B contained topsoil at the surface (0-1 inches bgs), followed by clay
with trace sand (1-16 inches bgs). The clay with trace sand was very dark
gray (5Y 3/1). Mottling was observed throughout. The mottles were
yellowish red (5YR 4/6), common, distinct and fine. Soil at Plot 2B was dry
