Delineation of Wetlands
SECTION FOUR
and Waters of the United States
banks of this creek were steeply cut (see Photos #17 and #18). Downed
trees at various points along the creek appear to impede the flow of water,
leading to some erosion and cutting observed along the bank. Field
investigators advanced several soil probes along the bank of this creek;
however, the soils were hard, dry and did not display the coloring nor other
characteristics of hydric soils.
4.2 WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
“Waters of the United States” is defined in Appendix F, and are those
waters under jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers, separate from wetlands,
yet included in the Section 404 review process. The Norborne Drainage
Ditch was evaluated to be “Waters of the United States”. The creek
examined on the Kevin Edgar property was not considered to be “Waters of
the United States”, given that its flow is ephemeral and the creek is isolated
from nearby jurisdictional waterways.
Using Ordinary High Water Mark points, other observations gathered by the
field investigators and a scaled site map, approximate boundaries of the
“Waters of the United States” were determined. Figure 10 presents an
outline of the “Jurisdictional Wetlands” and linear “Waters of the United
States” within the facility property. In order to differentiate between
jurisdictional wetlands and linear “Waters of the United States” (i.e.,
streambed where vegetation was absent), the total area of “Waters of the
United States” and the area of jurisdictional wetlands have been calculated
separately. A total of 3.5 acres of “Waters of the United States” do exist
within the facility limits of the project site.
Table 3 presents acreage values for the “Jurisdictional Wetlands” and the
linear “Waters of the United States”.
