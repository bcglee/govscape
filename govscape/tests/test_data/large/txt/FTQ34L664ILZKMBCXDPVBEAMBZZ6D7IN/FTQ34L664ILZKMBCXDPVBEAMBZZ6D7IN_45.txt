SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
According to the Carroll County soil survey, the three alternative corridor
areas are comprised of soils from the Bremer-Cotter-Booker association, the
Knox-Higginsville-Wakenda association and the Lagonda-Armster-Grundy
association. General characteristics of the Bremer-Cotter-Booker and Knox-
Higginsville-Wakenda associations within Carroll County, Missouri were
discussed earlier in this section. According to the Ray County soil survey,
the western-most portions of the two northernmost alternative corridors are
comprised of soils from the Armster-Lagonda-Sharpsburg association, Zook-
Nodaway-Bremer association and the Grundy-Lagonda association.
The Lagonda-Armster-Grundy association is characterized as deep, gently
sloping to strongly sloping, somewhat poorly-drained and moderately well-
drained soils that formed in loess, pedisediment and glacial till on uplands.
Approximately 56% of this association is comprised of Lagonda and similar
soils. Lagonda soils are somewhat poorly drained, and occur on ridgetops
and in slightly concave areas on sides of slopes. Armster soils comprise 20
percent of the Lagonda-Armster-Grundy association. These soils are
moderately well-drained. They are on narrow, sloping ridgetops and convex
side slopes. Grundy soils, comprising 13 percent of the association, are
somewhat poorly-drained. They are on broader ridgetops. Other minor soils
comprise approximately 11 percent of the Lagonda-Armster-Grundy
association.
The Armster-Lagonda-Sharpsburg association in Ray County, Missouri is
characterized as deep, gently sloping to moderately steep, moderately well-
drained and somewhat poorly-drained soils, formed in loess, pedisediments
and glacial till on uplands. Armster and similar soils comprise approximately
34 percent of this association. Armster soils are moderately well-drained
and are on narrow ridgetops and convex side slopes. Lagonda and similar
soils comprise 32 percent of the association. These soils are somewhat
poorly-drained and are on ridgetops, at the head of drainageways and on
slightly concave side slopes. Sharpsburg soils comprise 16 percent of the
