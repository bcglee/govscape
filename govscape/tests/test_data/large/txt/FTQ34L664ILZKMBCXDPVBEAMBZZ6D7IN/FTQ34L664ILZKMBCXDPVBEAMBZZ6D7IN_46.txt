Armster-Lagonda-Sharpsburg association. These soils are moderately well-
drained and commonly are on the narrow tops and ends of ridges. Other
minor soils comprise approximately 18 percent of the Armster-Lagonda-
Sharpsburg association.
The Zook-Nodaway-Bremer association is characterized as deep, nearly
level, poorly-drained and moderately well-drained soils formed in alluvium
on floodplains and terraces. This association occurs on floodplains of the
intermediate and small tributaries of the Missouri River. Zook and similar
soils comprise about 38 percent of this association. These soils are poorly-
drained and are on floodplains along small streams. Nodaway soils comprise
25 percent of the Zook-Nodaway-Bremer association, and are moderately
well-drained and on floodplains near the stream channels. Bremer soils
account for 19 percent of the Zook-Nodaway-Bremer association. These
soils are poorly-drained and are on low stream terraces along small streams.
Other minor soils comprise about 18 percent of the Zook-Nodaway-Bremer
association.
The Grundy-Lagonda association is characterized as deep, gently sloping and
moderately sloping, somewhat poorly-drained soils formed in loess or in
loess and pedisediments. Soils of this association occur on uplands,
specifically on ridgetops and side slopes on high, broad divides between the
major drainageways. Grundy soils comprise about 45 percent of this
association. These soils are generally on broad ridgetops and the less
dissected, slightly concave side slopes. Lagonda and similar soils account
for 34 percent of the Grundy-Lagonda association. These soils are generally
on narrower ridgetops and the ends of ridges and on the more dissected,
slightly concave side slopes. Other minor soils comprise approximately 21
percent of the Grundy-Lagonda association.
The Carroll County soil survey identifies the following detailed soil map units
