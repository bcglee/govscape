EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AECI) is proposing to develop a new
coal-fired generation unit in Carroll County, Missouri. The subject property
is located near the town of Norborne, Missouri. The construction of the
generation unit is classified as a major federal action, since the United
States Department of Agriculture/Rural Utility Service (USDA/RUS) has been
asked to assist with financing for the project. This requires that the project
be reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Planning
for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), to be completed under the
NEPA review, identified the need for a wetland delineation in the area of the
proposed plant structures, including the access roads, water line, discharge
line and substations. The EIS planning additionally identified the need for
review of available data to identify potential wetlands in three proposed
routing corridors which will connect the proposed new generation unit to one
of two existing rail lines.
The scope of work for the subject Preliminary Jurisdictional Wetland
Determination is to identify the jurisdictional wetlands and Waters of the
United States that may exist within the facility property. In addition to the
delineation completed for the facility property, available documented
information was reviewed for the areas within the proposed routing
corridors. A drive-by survey was also conducted for the routing corridors.
URS Corporation found from its review of available documented information
and field conditions that there are 3.5 acres of Waters of the United States,
including 2.9 acres of jurisdictional wetlands within the facility property.
Figure ES-1, provided below, presents the locations of the identified Waters
of the United States, including the jurisdictional wetlands. Of the three
proposed routing corridors, Alternative Corridor #1 appears to contain the
