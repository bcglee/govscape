SECTION ONE
Background
1.1 PROJECT LOCATION
The site is located northwest of Norborne, Missouri in Carroll County,
Missouri. The facility property measures approximately 1,500 acres in size.
It consists primarily of farmed corn and soybean fields. Several drainage
ditches traverse the farmed fields. The areas through which the corridor
alternatives have been proposed consists of farmed corn and soybean fields,
pasture and fallow field. Numerous farm ponds dot the landscape within the
areas of the proposed corridor alternatives. Wakenda Creek and the
Wakenda Creek West Fork also traverse a significant portion of two of the
corridor alternatives. The Missouri River lies approximately six miles south
of the facility property. Figure 1 is a site vicinity map, which depicts the
site relative to the community of Norborne and the Missouri River.
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The major components of the new 660 megawatt baseload coal-fired
generation unit will include a pulverized coal-fired boiler, steam turbine
generator, cooling tower, emission control equipment and stack. Coal will be
delivered to the plant via rail. A rotary railcar dumper will unload the coal,
where it will then be conveyed to either a coal yard for storage or directly to
the power block area. A waste fly ash pond will also be constructed within
the facility property.
A rail study was done to evaluate the various options for rail access to the
site. As mentioned above, three alternative routing corridors have been
proposed to connect the facility property to the three nearby rail lines. Both
Norfolk Southern (NS) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroads
have lines that run along the southern boundary of the facility property. An
additional BNSF railroad line runs approximately 6.8 to 7.2 miles north of the
facility property. Corridor Alternative #1, which lies almost entirely on
property owned by AECI, would link the facility property to the NS or BNSF
rail lines to the south. This connection measures approximately 2.5 miles in
