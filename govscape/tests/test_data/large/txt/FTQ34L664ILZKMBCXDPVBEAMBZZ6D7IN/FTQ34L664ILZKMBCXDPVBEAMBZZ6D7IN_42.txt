SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Plot 9B contained silt with clay throughout the soil probe (0-16 inches bgs).
The surface soil (0-4 inches bgs) color was very dark gray (10YR 3/1). Dark
yellowish brown mottles were present at this depth. The mottles were
common, distinct and medium. The soil matrix color changed at a depth of
4 inches bgs to very dark greenish gray (Gley 1 3/1/10Y). Mottles were also
present at this depth. These mottles were many, distinct, coarse and red
(2.5YR 4/8) in color. Soil at Plot 9B was moist. Plot 9B was established
within the heavily overgrown drainage ditch.
Plot 9C contained topsoil from a depth of 0 inches bgs to 16 inches bgs. Soil
at Plot 9C was dry and compact. Plot 9C was established upland of the
drainage ditch and downslope of the adjacent county road.
Plots 9A and 9C did not display features characteristic of hydric soil. Plot 9B
did contain gleyed and low chroma matrix colors and mottles, features
characteristic of hydric soil. Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are also
listed on the local Hydric Soils List. However, field observations did not
confirm the Booker mapped type, nor its inclusions.
Potential Wetland Area 10 â€“ Plots 10A, 10B and 10C
Plot points 10A, 10B and 10C were established within a shaded corridor
between two cultivated soybean fields. The corridor measured
approximately 50 feet wide. The topography of the central portion of the
corridor is depressed, and appears to be an intermittent drainageway. Plots
10A and 10C were established upland, and on either side of Plot 10B.
The soil at Plot 10A consisted of topsoil at a depth of 0 to 8 inches bgs.
Refusal was encountered at 8 inches bgs. The soil at Plot 10A was very dry
and compact. Plot 10A was established upslope of the apparent
drainageway.
Plot 10B was very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) silty clay. This soil extended
throughout the length of the soil probe (0-16 inches bgs). No mottling was
