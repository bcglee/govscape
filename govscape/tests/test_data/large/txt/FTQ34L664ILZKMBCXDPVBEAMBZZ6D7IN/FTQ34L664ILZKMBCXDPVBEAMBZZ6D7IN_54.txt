SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Plot area 7 was established east of Plot areas 4 and 5. Plot 7A was located
immediately upland of the drainage ditch. A steep slope led down to the
ditch. The location of Plot 7A was above the bank that would typically hold
water. No signs of wetland hydrology were evident at Plot 7A; therefore, the
hydrology criteria were not met here. Although, a wetland fringe does
surround the drainage ditch, and extends approximately five feet in
elevation above the water’s edge.
Potential Wetland Area 8 – Plots 8A and 8B
Plot area 8 was established adjacent to a drainage ditch running through a
soybean field on the southeastern portion of the facility property. Plot 8A
was located directly adjacent to the soybean field. Wetland hydrology was
clearly not present at this location, as the field is farmed and drained. Plot
8B was located within the drainage ditch. No signs of wetland hydrology
were present (saturated soils within upper 12 inches, water marks, drift
lines, sediment deposits). Approximately 40% of the drainage ditch
contained vegetation. Plot area 8 did not meet the hydrology criteria.
Potential Wetland Area 9 – Plots 9A, 9B and 9C
Plot area 9 was established adjacent to a drainage ditch which parallels
County Road 300, at the northeastern portion of the facility property. The
drainage ditch is bordered by the county road and a soybean field. Plot 9A
was located immediately downslope of the soybean field and upslope of the
drainage ditch. The area was heavily overgrown in vegetation. Plot 9B was
located within the ditch basin. The ditch was heavily overgrown with
vegetation and the soil was cracked, indicating that it had not held
significant water for some time. Plot 9C was located upslope of the drainage
ditch and downslope of the county road. The area was highly overgrown
with weedy, roadside vegetation. No signs of wetland hydrology, such as
water marks, drift lines and sediment deposits, were present at Plot area 9.
Plot area 9 did not meet the hydrology criteria.
