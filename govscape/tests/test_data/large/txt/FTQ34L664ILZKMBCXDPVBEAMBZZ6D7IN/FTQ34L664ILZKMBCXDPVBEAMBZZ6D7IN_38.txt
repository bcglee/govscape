SECTION THREE
Discussion of Wetlands
Plot 3C contained silt with clay at a depth of 0 to 4 inches bgs, and was
black (7.5YR 2.5/1). Clay with silt and sand was observed at 4 to 10 inches
bgs. The clay was black (7.5YR 2.5/1), and did not display mottling. At a
depth of 10 inches bgs, the sand became trace in abundance and the soil
color changed to brown (7.5YR 4/2). Mottling was present in this deeper
soil. Mottle color was strong brown (7.5YR 5/8). Mottles were many,
distinct and medium. Soil moisture increased with depth at Plot 3C. Plot 3C
was established in a depressional area adjacent to a county road.
Plot 3A did not display features characteristic of hydric soil. Plots 3B and 3C
did contain low chroma matrix colors and mottles, features characteristic of
hydric soil. Soils of this area, Booker silty clay, are also listed on the local
Hydric Soils List. However, field observations did not confirm the Booker
mapped type, nor its inclusions (Norborne and Bremer).
Potential Wetland Area 4 â€“ Plots 4A and 4B
Plot points 4A and 4B were established adjacent to a drainage ditch, at the
intersection of a county road and cultivated soybean field. Plot 4A was
upland of Plot 4B.
The surface soil at Plot 4A consisted of topsoil (0-2 inches bgs). The topsoil
was underlain by a clay with silt and trace sand. The clay extended from 2
inches bgs to 16 inches bgs, and was black (7.5YR 2.5/1). Mottling began at
a depth of 6 inches bgs and extended throughout the remainder of the soil
probe. The mottles were few, distinct, medium and strong brown (7.5YR
5/8) in color. The soil at Plot 4A was somewhat moist. Plot 4A was
established directly adjacent to the planted soybean field, at the upland
boundary of the downward slope to the drainage ditch.
Plot 4B soils consisted of silt with sand throughout the entire soil probe (0-
16 inches bgs). The silt was very dark bluish gray (Gley 2 3/1/5PB).
Mottling was observed throughout. The mottles were strong brown (7.5YR
