Actual field work provided SCS biologists
an opportunity not only to increase wildlife
on the farms, but to learn new methods of
wildlife enhancement. The field biologists
worked with farmers and SCS field staff to
incorporate wildlife considerations into
farm plans. They disseminated the lessons
of their practical field experience through
numerous guidelines, technical bulletins,
and popular articles.
With the expansion of programs and
national legislation to enhance fish and
wildlife, the role of biologists and the
requirements made of them have changed.
Rather than serving as planners who spend
a great deal of time developing the wildlife
section of conservation plans, they now
more likely work as trainers who instruct
others in how to integrate biology with the
various SCS programs.
Concerns about the impacts of small
watershed projects on fish and wildlife
habitat increased the biologist's role in
evaluating design changes to lessen adverse
impacts on wildlife. The passage of the
Endangered Species Act and the National
Environmental Policy Act have further
broadened the scope of the biologist's role.
SCS biologists are now required to have a
thorough knowledge of SCS and other
USDA programs to address fish and
wildlife concerns. Biologists advise on pol-
