(inventorying the plant community) to the
system. The variance of the existing plant
community from the potential climax com-
munity determined the range condition for
that site. Relic sites provided an approxi-
mation of the climax community.
Armed with this information, the range
specialist could then determine the range
condition for the ranchers and advise them
on grazing practices that would help main-
tain or improve range conditions.
The range site and condition system has
served SCS and the range well for several
reasons. First, this system is easily under-
stood. Second, by trying to approximate or
maintain natural range conditions, it pro-
duces a plant community that is valued for
many uses, such as wildlife habitat, water
retention and infiltration, and erosion con-
trol.
Various specialized grazing systems have
been proposed and used. However, the
range site and condition classification has
remained the foundation of SCS's range
management assistance. Indeed, surveys
between the 1930s and the present have
indicated a general improvement in range-
land.
