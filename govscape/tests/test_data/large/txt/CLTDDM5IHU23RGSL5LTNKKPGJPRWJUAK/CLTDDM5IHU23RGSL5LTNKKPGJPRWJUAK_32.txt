In the decades since World War 11, SCS has
become more involved in foreign assistance
missions. Current thinking on the best
means of technology transfer seems happily
matched with some of SCS's preferences
and operating methods. Throughout its
history, SCS has emphasized the technically
trained person assisting the land user.
Experience has shown one of the preferred
methods of technology transfer to be when
the foreign country plays a role in the
decision-making. Institution-building, such
as helping establish a soil and water conser-
vation unit operated by that country's citi-
zens, bears great promise, not only for the
present, but also for the future--which,
after all, is what conservation is about.
