33 Conversation with Abraham Avidor,
Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, December 2, 1983.
Richard D. Siegel, Deputy Assistant Secre-
tary, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
brought this saying to my attention and Mr.
Avidor, who grew up on a kibbutz and who
knew Mr. Bentov supplied the details.
Bentov was seeking to promote the devel-
opment of agriculture and viewed the direct
food assistance as an inhibiting factor.
Avidor reports that the saying was quite
prevalent in Israel in the 1950s.
