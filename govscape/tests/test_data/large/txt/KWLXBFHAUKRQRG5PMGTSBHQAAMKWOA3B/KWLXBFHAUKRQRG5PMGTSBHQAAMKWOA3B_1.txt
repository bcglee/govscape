MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study started in the fall of 2005 and will continue over three cotton growing seasons (2006­
2008). Four fields at the USDA-ARS J. Phil Campbell, Sr., Natural Resource Conservation
Center in Watkinsville, GA (33° 59' N, 83° 27' W) historically in no-tillage and instrumented to
determine management effects on sediment and nutrient losses from typical fields in the
Southern Piedmont are used in the study. Three of the fields are 3.3 acres while the fourth is 6.9
acres.
Winter rye (Secale cereale L.) is planted with a no-till grain drill in early October as a cover
crop on all fields. Poultry litter is applied in the fall to provide sufficient P for both rye and
cotton (Gossipium hirsutum L.) and supplemental N is added as needed for cotton and rye. On
two fields, rye is grazed with heifer cattle for 10 to 14 days starting in late-March. The other two
fields are not grazed and the rye is killed with glyphosate the second week of April. Cattle in the
grazing treatment are weighed at the beginning and end of the grazing period. Stocking rate is
established based on forage availability and estimated intake so that pastures are defoliated in
approximately 10 days. Cover crop biomass is determined prior to and after grazing and just
prior to cotton planting. Cover crop residues are analyzed for carbon and N, P, K, Ca, Mg.
Cotton is planted the first week of May with a no-till planter. Cotton plants are sampled at first
bloom and mid-bloom for biomass, plant height, and nutrient status to determine grazing and
landscape effects on growth and nutrient content. Winter grazing effects on plant water stress
and soil water availability (0 to 30 cm) are determined from first bloom until cutout by
measuring soil water content using TDR probes inserted vertically into the soil. Cotton is
harvested in the fall after defoliation using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor and GPS to
collect georeferenced yields. Cotton samples from five areas in each field are collected for
determination of fiber length, strength, micronair, and uniformity using High Volume Instrument
(HVI) classing.
Prior to planting in the fall of 2006, we sampled the fields using standard soil survey
characterization techniques on a 12-m by 12-m grid (˜ 10 points acre-1) using a trailer mounted
hydraulic sampler equipped with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) to determine
soil characteristics. Soil cores were 5 cm diameter by 60 cm depth and are being characterized
for soil texture, soil C, soil N, depth to the Bt layer, and plant nutrients by depth. Soil electrical
conductivity (EC) was determined with a Veris Technologies 3100 Soil Electrical Conductivity
Mapping systemequipped with DGPS. Soil penetration resistance was measured using a tractor
mounted penetrometer with DGPS. Soil type, EC data, depth to Bt, and soil penetrometer data
are being combined in a Geographic Information System (GIS) for developing plant sampling
zones for the second cotton growing season.
To determine the cumulative grazing effects on soil compaction, soil penetration resistance
measurements are repeated each year at the same locations in the spring following cotton
planting. Geostatistical methods will be used to analyze soil, water, and plant data to determine
landscape and grazing effects on cotton productivity. At the end of the study, soil samples will
be collected from the 0 to 5 and 5 to 10 cm depths to evaluate changes in soil C and soil quality
parameters (particulate soil carbon and nitrogen, soil microbial biomass, aggregate stability).
