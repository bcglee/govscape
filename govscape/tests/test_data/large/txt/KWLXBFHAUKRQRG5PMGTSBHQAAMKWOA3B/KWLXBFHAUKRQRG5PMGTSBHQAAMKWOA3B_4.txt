We estimated that a stocking rate of 1.4 animals/acre would have kept the area defoliated
between February 1st and April 15th if animal management and agronomic management are
efficient and climate is adequate.
Yield data
Cotton was planted May 12th and 15th just prior to 10 days of cool weather which delayed
germination and growth. Cotton was harvested in the fall of 2006 using a picker with a yield
monitor. Seed cotton yields ranged from 2140 lbs/ac to 2950 lb/ac. No significant yield
differences were detected between grazed and ungrazed fields (both treatments averaged
approximately 2500 lb/ac). After ginning, our yield per acre averaged 1008 lb lint/ac.
Conservation tillage, heavy residue from the rye cover crop, late season rain in August and a dry
fall were critical for producing yields in this range. Georgia’s cotton production for 2006 totaled
2.12 million bales (480 lb lint/bale) on 1.33 million acres and averaged 765 lb/ac or 1.6 bales/ac.
CONCLUSIONS
Preliminary results indicate grazing cover crops can be a viable option for cotton producers in
the Southern Piedmont because of the potential to increase revenues from grazing without
reducing cotton yields.
