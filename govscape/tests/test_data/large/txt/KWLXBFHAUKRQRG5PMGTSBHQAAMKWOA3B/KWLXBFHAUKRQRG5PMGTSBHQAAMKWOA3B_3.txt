that appeared to prolong germination and stand establishment. Limited rainfall during June
reduced cotton growth, whereas rain in July and August coincided with blooming and boll
formation. Total rainfall during the cotton growing period from May to September was 14.9
inches; 6.4 inches below the long term average.

Grazing Data
In the first year, cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) herbage grew from approximately 1000 lbs/acre in
February to 8000 lbs/acre in mid April. The area was grazed with 59 Angus heifers for 11 days
(in March and April) beginning with an initial herbage mass of approximately 3000 lbs/acre,
which ultimately provided approximately 4000 lbs/acre of grazed forage during the grazing
period.
In the second year with fewer animals (40 Angus heifers) we began grazing during a period of
rapid growth with a herbage mass of only 2000 lbs/acre defoliated over 7 days harvesting an
estimated 2300 lbs/acre. However, because of the earlier start the fields were defoliated twice
although the second defoliation, only yielding approximately half of the original grazed forage.
