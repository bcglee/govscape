The data will also be used to develop guidelines for decisions on subsoiling after cattle grazing.
Economic costs of grazing winter rye in a cotton system will be determined. Grazing effects on
runoff characteristics (water loss, sediment, nutrients and microorganisms) of the watersheds will
be determined and evaluated against historic runoff and soil loss characteristics of the fields.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Identification of management areas
Management zones were developed for future guidance in the development of sampling schemes
and to test for relationships between management zone designations associated with grazed
versus ungrazed fields. Thus far management zo nes were developed in 2 ways. First we utilized
the spatially referenced variables of;
1) Elevation,
2) Slope,
3) Plan curvature,
4) Profile curvature,
5) Compound topographic index,
6) Soil electrical conductivity at two depths (0 to 30 cm and 0 to 90 cm),
7) Depth to the Bt soil horizon,
8) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index collected during early growth of fall planted
small grains in 2006, and
9) Cotton yield from 2006.
Secondly, we estimated the principle components of a dataset consisting of these variables and
used the orthogonal variables from the principle component analysis to developed management
zones. In both cases, the data currently support 2 to 5 management zones and zones do not show
a relationship with the grazing treatment. Management zones were defined across all four fields
and the analysis indicated only one zone was well represented in all fields while other zones
were missing in some fields. Currently we have 5 variables describing the topography, 2
variables related to soil properties, and two plant growth variables. In the future, we will add
additional soil and plant variables to the dataset and repeat the statistical analysis testing for
changes in the management zones with time as related to treatment variables and to soil variables
influenced by management.
Weather data
Cover crop growing period temperature and rainfall were similar to long term averages. Rainfall
deficits occurred in November, March, and April of the rye growing period. The rainfall deficit
in the spring did not appear to negatively impact rye growth or availability of forage in the first
year of the study.
During the cotton growing season, temperatures were near the historic trends. However, there
was a period of cool temperatures during the two weeks following cotton planting in mid-May
