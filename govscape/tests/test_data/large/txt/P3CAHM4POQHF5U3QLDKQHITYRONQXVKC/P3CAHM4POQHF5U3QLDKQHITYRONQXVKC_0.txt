in dense zonal stands.
Distribution and Adaptation
Black needlerush is one of the dominate species in
the marshes on the southern Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
It dominates 20.7% of the marsh in the south Atlantic
states and 7.3% of Gulf coast marshes. But, it covers
more marsh area on the Gulf coast than the Atlantic
coast. Its distribution is continuous from Maryland to
Florida and westward to southwestern Texas. Black
needlerush occupies the edge of ditches and
shorelines of bays, back bays and tributaries of tidal
systems in coastal systems. It is well adapted to fine
and medium textured soils, has a high tolerance to
anaerobic conditions, high tolerance to calcium
carbonate (CaCO ) and tolerates pH ranges from 4.0-
