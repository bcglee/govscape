392 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The 18 deep sand beds for tree crops at the U. S. Regional Salinity
Laboratory, Riverside, California, have inside dimensions of 5 x 10 x 6 feet
deep. They are spaced 10 x 18 feet center to center. Whole permeable
brick are laid above drainage ways cast in the concrete floor. A number
of tubes for the escape of air during flushing are extended into the gravel
laid above the permeable brick. The inside dimensions of the reservoirs are
7 x 4 x 6 feet deep.
A high silica cement-lined pipe sold under the trade name “Duroline” is
used for all plumbing with promising results from the standpoint of cor-
rosion.
The concrete walls of these cultures are made nearly impermeable and
chemically inert by a two-coat sprayed-on dressing of emulsified aspllalt.10
