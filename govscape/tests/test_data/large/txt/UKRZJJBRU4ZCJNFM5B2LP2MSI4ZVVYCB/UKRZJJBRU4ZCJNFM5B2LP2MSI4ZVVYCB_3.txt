388 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
a hexagonal nut which permits ready disconnection of the air line when the
cultures are to be dissembled.
3. Koroseal tubing.-Tubing of this $ypel (suggested by L. A. RICHARDS)
stands up under greenhouse light conditions much better than rubber tub-
ing. It is heated in a water bath before being set in place.
4. Air-discharge tubes.-Soft aluminum tubing with j-inch outside diam-
eter. A l/32-inch hole is bored through one wall at 4a to emit air. The
lower end is closed by clamping it in a machine vise.
5. Funnel supports.-These are the two halves of a no. 2 rubber stopper.
6. Aluminum funnel.--Outside diameter of base, 22 inches.
7. Solution delivery tube.--Hard thin-walled aluminum tubing 22%
inches with &inch outside diameter. V-notches .75-inch deep are cut on
long
opposite sides of the lower end to provide inlets for the solution. The deliv-
ery rate of solution by this tubing with an inside diameter of 17 mm. in single
tests was 2.6 liters per minute compared with a rate of 1.3 liters per minute
from a tube with 13-mm. inside diameter. Corrosion of this tubing can be
delayed by dipping it in Bakelite varnish.â€™
8. Glazed stoneware covers.-These are used to suppress growth of algae
and check surface evaporation. Slips of sheet aluminum or cardboard with
U-shaped notches for the plant stems are laid over the openings in the cover
after the plants have been thinned to final number.
9. Glass sleeve and overflow.--Pyrex glass tubing with inside diameter
of 22 mm. and outside 30 mm., length 17 cm. To seal in place, the glass
tube is extended through the circular opening in porous disc, 15, and bottom
of the tray, 10, letting the lower end of the tube rest on the work bench.
After placing a centimeter depth of coarse sand in the bottom of the
V-shaped opening around the porous disc, hot G-K compound, 14, is poured
in with a spoon until the groove is filled. A thin rim of G-K is
compound
then built up on the disc around tube. When this material has hardened,
the tray is inverted and hot red sealing, wax is added to fill up the space
between the tube and rim of the opening in the bottom of the tray. The
top of the overflow tube should now be about 1.5 cm. below the top of the
tray.
10. Xand tray.-This piece of stoneware has a volume of about 6.5 liters.
11. Quartz sand and magnetite.-Five kilograms of sand is mixed with
25 grams of powdered magnetite, Fe0 Fe,O,. The layer of gravel in the
bottom of the tray should be wetted before adding the sand. A sand, of
which 50 per cent. is retained by a 60-mesh screen after passing a 40-mesh

wall thickness.
2 A hard rubber tubing supplied by Kirkhill Rubber Company, Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, with 22/32-inch inside diameter and 25/32-inch outside diameter, also appears to
be satisfactory in preliminary trials and it is somewhat less expensive.
