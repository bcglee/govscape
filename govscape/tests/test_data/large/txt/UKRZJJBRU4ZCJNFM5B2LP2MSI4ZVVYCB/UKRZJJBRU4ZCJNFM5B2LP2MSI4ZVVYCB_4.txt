screen, has been found to be satisfactory.3 In solutions at pH 6, the mag-
netite has supplied ample iron to all plants tested (1, 2, 3).
12. Air vents.--Without these glass tubes which extend into the gravel,
air is locked in the sand when the trays are flushed, thus preventing a free,
uniform, downward movement of solution.
13. Quartz gravel.-One kilogram of gravel of a size which passes a
4-mesh screen and is held on an S-mesh screen is suitable. The sand does
not work down into the gravel if the latter is wetted before filling.
14. Asphalt compound.--This product, which is sold under the trade
name G-K sewer-joint compound, has a rather low melting point, but it
maintains a good union with the glazed walls of the sand tray when it Porou
15. Porous disc.--These are purchased in 6:-inch squares 1 inch thick.
A 30-mm. hole is first bored through the center on a press drill with a steel
tube. From 10 to 14 of them are then strung on a 30-111111. rod, clamped into
a lathe, and then turned down to a diameter of 6yâ€™ inches. The material
works easily. The permeability of the discs is about 600 ml. per minute
when the trays are filled with sand and the solution is at the height of the
overflow.
16. Red sealing wax.--This is used to seal the overflow tubes, 9, into the
bottoms of the sand trays. Five grams of finely powdered sealing wax
added to a liter of culture solution has been found to be somewhat toxic to
tomato plants in water cultures. The small solid piece used in this seal
has shown no ill effects.
17. Reservoir.-The jars shown have a capacity of 14.5 liters. They
have three outlets, each of which takes a no. 2 rubber stopper. The opening
at 19 is set 4 inches to the right of those at 20 and 21.
18. Cap for water gauge.--This is a piece of &inch aluminum tubing
with one end closed. Its use prevents the growth of algae in the gauge.
. 19. Water-addition opening.--In replenishing solutions, this stopper is
removed and the point of a self-closing radiator faucet inserted.
20. Water gauge.--This is a 5- or 6-mm. glass tube bent in the shape
shown and painted black below cap.
21. Outlet for emptying reservoirs.
22. Culture solution.--Salts for 13 liters are used in making up 11 liters
of solution. Two liters of water are then added to the surface of the sand
and when draining has stopped, a wax mark is made on the water level
gauge to indicate the initial volume. The five kilograms of sand retain
between 1.6 and 1.8 liters of solution against gravity.
