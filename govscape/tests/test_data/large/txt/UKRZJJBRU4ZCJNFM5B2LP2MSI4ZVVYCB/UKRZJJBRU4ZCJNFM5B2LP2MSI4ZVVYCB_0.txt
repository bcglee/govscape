Introduction
A detailed description is presented in this paper of small sand and water
culture equipment. A number of large out-of-doors sand cultures both for
tree and annual crops have also been constructed at the U. S. Regional
Salinity Laboratory, Riverside, California. In their general features these
latter cultures are like those described in an earlier publication (3). The
more significant modifications are discussed.
The same principle of operation is used in all of the sand culture equip-
ment. Briefly stated, each sand culture consists of a sand bed and a solu-
tion reservoir. Nutrient solution is pumped from the reservoir onto the
surface of the sand at hourly or other selected intervals. The solution
applied to the surface of the sand displaces to the reservoir a large part of
the solution remaining in the sand from the previous flushing. Drainage to
the reservoirs is provided by the use of a permeable aluminum silicate mate-
rial manufactured in the form of bricks for the insulation of furnaces.
These bricks (or discs) confine root growth to the sand and thus prevent
the stoppage of drains. Inasmuch as the intervals of application of solution
to the sand are controlled by time clocks, a minimum of manual attention
is required.
Small sand cultures
The stoneware cultures, figures 1 to 3, were designed for nutritional
studies in the greenhouses where the effects of a number of treatments are
compared in replicated cultures. While the equipment shown was intended
primarily for small plants, its usefulness for large plants is indicated by the
tomatoes in figure 2. For use with large plants advantages of larger reser-
voirs are indicated, since the frequency with which new solutions are substi-
tuted for old ones; or the frequency with which determinations and additions
of nutrient ions are made, can thereby be reduced. The pottery company
that has cooperated in the manufacture of the stoneware has advised that
they can build 35- or 40-liter stoneware reservoirs with bell-shaped tops that
would accommodate the present sand trays and other fittings.
CHAPMAN'S and LIEBIG's idea (1) of using air-lift pumps has been
adopted in these cultures. These investigators made use of large earthen-
ware tile reservoirs set in greenhouse floors.
The sand cultures shown in figure 3 are mounted on a rotating table to
produce uniform conditions in an unevenly lighted greenhouse. Com-
