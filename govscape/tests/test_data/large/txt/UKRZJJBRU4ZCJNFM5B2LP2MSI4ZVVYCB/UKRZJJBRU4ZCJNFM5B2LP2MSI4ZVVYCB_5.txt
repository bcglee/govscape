390 PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
23. Magnetic air valve.5
24. Air pressure line.-Air pressures up to about 50 pounds are satisfac-
tory. Where a large number of cultures are operated from a single air line,
the latter pressure beyond the pressure regulator is desirable. A discharge
rate of 0.7 cu. ft. of air per minute per culture gives a satisfactory solution
delivery rate.
25. Time switch.--The General Electric TSA-14 time switch can be used
alone without time-switch 26 if the cultures are flushed each hour throughout
the 24 hour period. This timer makes a complete cycle every 60 minutes.
The duration of the “on” period can be set for any fraction of the 60-minute
period. Three minutes are ample for the complete replacement of the solu-
tion held by the sand, providing air pressures are maintained.
26. Time switch.“-This switch is connected in series with switch 25 in
such a way that the circuit to the magnetic valve is completed only during
an “on” period of both timers. The “on” and “off” pins on the 24-hour
dial of the Sangamo timer cannot be inserted nearer together than 15 min-
utes. This switch is used to limit the flushing of the sand trays to selected
hours.
Water cultures
In using the sand-culture solution reservoirs as water cultures, the air
hose leading from each greenhouse bench is disconnected from the non-
continuous high-pressure air line and attached to a continuous low pressure
outlet. Carbon-tube aerators are employed following a suggestion originat-
ing with P. R. STOUT and D. I. ARNON of the University of California.
1 and 4. Glazed stoneware cover.-Two sizes of tapered holes are pro-
vided in this cover for mounting seedlings of various sized plants. The
cotton mountings for seedlings stay in place better if the holes are not glazed.
2. Rubber or Koroseal connection.
3. Glass or t-inch aluminum tubing.
5. Aerator.-Plain carbon pipe,’ diameter inside &inch, outside s-inch.
Five pounds of air pressure can be used without blowing the cork stoppers
if they are inserted after having been dipped in hot G-K Compound.
