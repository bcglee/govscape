INTRODUCTION
Beet curly top virus (BCTV, a leafhopper-vectored Curtovirus) and closely related species are
endemic to the northwestern USA. Crop losses can be severe when susceptible large-seeded
Andean dry and green bean cultivars are planted early in dry areas surrounded by abandoned or
wastelands full of weeds or near semi-arid rangeland. Plant dwarfing, leaf puckering and
chlorosis, and lack of pod production may result on plants infected at the seedling stage. Small
and medium seeded Middle American cultivars, in general, are more tolerant.
There are five distinct Curtovirus species in the USA most of which can infect common bean.
The ubiquitous presence of resistance in most great northern, pink, pinto, and red Mexican
cultivars grown in the western USA may derive from the landraces California Pink and Common
Red Mexican (see Miklas, 2000). ‘Burtner’ is also known to have contributed curly top
resistance to green bean cultivars. A SCAR marker for the dominant gene, Bct, conferring
resistance to BCTV, was generated and mapped to chromosome 4 (Larsen and Miklas, 2004).
However, the marker is only useful for large-seeded Andean bean breeding.
Symptoms similar to BCTV may also be produced by Bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV, a
whitefly transmitted geminivirus), Bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV, a whitefly transmitted
geminivirus), and Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV, a whitefly transmitted
geminivirus). BDMV and BGMV occur in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil, whereas BGYMV is
found in tropical and subtropical Central America, coastal Mexico, the Caribbean, and
southeastern USA. Each of these viruses may also cause severe yield losses in susceptible
cultivars in favorable conditions. Our objective was to determine the response to BCTV of
selected common bean genotypes with resistance to BDMV, BGMV, and BGYMV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixty-five dry and green bean genotypes of diverse origin were planted in a farmer’s field near
Kimberly, Idaho in 2007. A randomized complete block design with two replicates was used.
Each plot consisted of 1 m long spaced 0.56 m apart. An average of 20 seeds was planted in each
plot. Viruliferous leafhoppers (Circulifer tenellus Baker) reared on susceptible sugar beet plants
were released in the nursery approximately three weeks after emergence. Data on plot basis were
recorded five weeks after infestation and verified at fully developed pod stage (R8). A 1 to 5
disease rating scale was used, where 1= healthy plants with no visible disease symptoms,
2=moderately resistant, 3=moderately susceptible, 4=susceptible, and 5=highly susceptible.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Of 65 dry and green bean genotypes cranberry Capri and UI 51 were highly susceptible
and G 5686 and Dragone were susceptible (Table 1). Beluga, Lassen, USWA 64, Morales (with
bgm-1), PR0247-49, Royal Red, Yakima, and Hooter were moderately susceptible. The
moderately resistant group included A 195, Common Pinto, Common Red Mexican, GMR 2, G
122, Kimberly, PR 9771-3-2, Sawtooth, Tio Canela 75, UI 686, USWA 68, and Idelight. Dry
bean genotypes A 429 (with bgm-1), DOR 390, DOR 500, and G 2402 (synonymous with
