Garrapato which is the original source of bgm-1) did not exhibit any symptoms of BCTV. In
general, breeding lines and cultivars with known resistance to BGMV and BGYMV (except
Morales) were either resistant or moderately resistant to BCTV. In 2008, our intension is to
repeat the experiment to verify the results obtained thus far. Nonetheless, based on our past
experience and published literature it may be concluded that the race Durango cultivars and
landraces are sources of genes that impart resistance to most viruses attacking common bean
including BCMV and BCMNV (e.g., UI 31, UI 34, UI 35, UI 59), BCTV (e.g., California Pink,
Common Red Mexican), BYMV (e.g., UI 31, UI 59), and BDMV, BGMV, and BGYMV (e.g.,
Garrapato). Further molecular and genetics research would be required to understand the
evolutionary origin of the virulence and resistance genes for these viruses.

†BCTV= Beet curly top virus. Scored on a 1 to 5 rating scale, where 1= healthy plants with no
visible disease symptoms, 2=moderately resistant, 3=moderately susceptible, 4=susceptible, and
5=highly susceptible.
‡Race Durango landrace or cultivar.
