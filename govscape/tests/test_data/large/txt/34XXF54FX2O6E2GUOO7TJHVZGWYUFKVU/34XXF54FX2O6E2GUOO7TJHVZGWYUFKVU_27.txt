Evaluation of the School Breakfast Program Pilot Project: Findings from the First Year of Implementation
20
There was also a negative impact of universal-free
school breakfast on disciplinary visits to the princi-
palâ€™s office. In schools where universal-free school
breakfasts were offered, the average number of daily
disciplinary visits (per 100 students) was signifi-
cantly higher than in control schools (1.13 and .86,
respectively). When analyzed further, the data reveal
that the impact was primarily due to a difference in
disciplinary incidents occurring in the morning.
Other Outcomes
There were no significant differences between
treatment school students and controls on meas-
ures of cognitive or social/emotional function-
ing; academic achievement (reading and math
for all grades combined); attendance; tardiness;
food insecurity; body mass index; or student
health, including parent reports of health and
visits to the school nurse.
Impact of Participation in
School Breakfast
The analyses reported above contrasted outcomes
between all students in the treatment school sam-
ple and all students in the control school sample to
assess the impact of the availability of universal-free
school breakfast, by relying on the strength of the
randomized experimental design. The effect on
those treatment school students who actually par-
ticipated in universal-free school breakfast was also
examined, by applying a statistical adjustment
(based on Bloom, 1984) to the availability data
described above. Based on this adjustment, the
impacts on participants, though greater, generally
followed those reported for the impact of the avail-
ability of universal-free school breakfast, for both
positive and negative effects.
