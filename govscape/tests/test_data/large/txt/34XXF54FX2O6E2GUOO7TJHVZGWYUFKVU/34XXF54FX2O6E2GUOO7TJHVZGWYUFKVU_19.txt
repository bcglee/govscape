1 If food and labor costs are inflated by 12.4 percent to account for “all other” costs, consistent with the findings of earlier research (Glantz et
al., 1994), the share of schools where total breakfast revenue equaled or exceeded total cost falls to 92.4 percent for treatment schools and to
57.7 percent for control schools.

7 For SY 2000–2001, the reimbursement was $1.12 for free meals; $0.82 for reduced-price meals; and $0.21 for paid meals. Reimbursement rates for severe need
schools provide an additional $0.21 for each free and reduced-price breakfast that was served.
