Plant Materials Center Havard panicum grows in arroyos and sand hills of
western Texas, southern New Mexico and northern
Mexico (Hitchcock 1935). This grass, like giant
sandreed (Calamovilfa gigantea), and blowout grass
(Redfieldia flexuosa) are among the first native
species to show up as stabilizers on deep, active, sand
dune areas. Giant sandreed and blowout grass are
common over a wide section of the southern United
States, but Havard panicum is found only in Texas,
southern New Mexico, and northern Mexico, in
arroyos and on the extensive dune areas. It is
prevalent in Ward, Crane, Winkler, Ector, and
Andrews Counties of western Texas.
Establishment
Havard panicum is established from seed in the
