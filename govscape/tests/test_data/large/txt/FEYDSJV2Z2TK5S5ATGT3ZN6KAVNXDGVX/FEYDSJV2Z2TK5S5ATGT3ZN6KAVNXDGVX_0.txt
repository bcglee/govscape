Field Collection of Arundinaria gigantea (Giant Cane)
DESCRIPTION: Giant Cane is a woody,
perennial, rhizomatous native grass. That
has stout, hollow, jointed stems that grows
from 2 to 26 feet tall, but typically around 5
feet in southern Indiana. Leaves are simple,
alternate, and lanceolate reaching 12 inches
in length. Lower leaves may lack petioles.
Spikelets have 8 to 12 flowers, and generally
occur in racemes or panicles, but may be
solitary.
WHERE USUALLY FOUND: Giant Cane
occurs from southern Maryland and Virginia
to southern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and
Missouri, south to central Florida, and west
to Texas. In Indiana, Giant Cane might be
found in Southern Indiana south of a line
from Vincennes to Mitchell to Rising Sun. It
inhabits low-lying, moist to wet sites,
including low woodlands of various
mixtures, woodlands on mesic and submesic
slopes and uplands, river and stream banks,
shrub-tree bogs and bays, sloughs, bayous
and pocosins, and mesic to wet savannas.
These canes are commonly intermixed with
shrubs, but in more favorable situations,
often form dense stands or brakes. Brakes
composed of large cane occur in fertile,
alluvial river bottoms sufficiently elevated
so that flooding is short in duration.
WHAT TO COLLECT: Collect 2- to 3-foot sections of rhizome with nodes and about 20 inches of
stem from at least 20 plants scattered throughout the stand, but do not deplete standâ€™s potential for
continued regeneration. Rhizomes with some emerging shoots are preferred.
WHEN TO COLLECT: Material is best if collected during dormancy.
HOW TO HANDLE COLLECTION: Place collected material USDA - NRCS
and some moistened soil in a suitable-sized, sealed (to retain Alderson Plant Materials Center
moisture), plastic bag. Ship material and completed Old Prison Farm Road
collection form by express carrier immediately to: County Route 3/29
