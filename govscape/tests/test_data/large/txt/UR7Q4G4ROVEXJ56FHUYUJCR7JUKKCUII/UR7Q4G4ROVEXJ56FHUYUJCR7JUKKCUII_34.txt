The authors delineate six major climatic areas of the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.)
region. They subdivide these areas into 21 site zones, each of which is deemed homogenous
with respect to climate, physiography, and soils. The site zones are mapped and their
climate, physiography, and soils described. The authors recommend that plantings of
longleaf pine in any of the six major climatic areas of the longleaf region be made with a
seed source from the same area.
