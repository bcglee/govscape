Shubuta, Columbia, Hattiesburg, and Poplarville, MS; and the temperature regime in this section is much like that in
Amite and Bogalusa, LA. This section generally comprises the Georgia uplands, but it gets more rainfall. This section
what is sometimes considered the East Gulf Coast. A small differs from the Florida section by having two rainfall peaks,
distinct climatic area located east and north of Mobile Bay is rather than just one in July. This section generally coincides

rainfall patterns are quite similar for all stations and exhibit
two distinct and nearly equal maximum monthly peaks in Climate of the Bay Insert—This section indents the
March and July. A third, but much smaller, peak occurs in Alabama-Mississippi section to the east and north of Mobile
December. The rainfall minimum occurs in October at all Bay. The Bay Insert’s climate is characterized by that of the
stations, and a secondary low occurs in May at most stations stations located at Robertsdale, Bay Minette, and Citronelle,
and in June at Shubuta and Hattiesburg, MS, and Bogalusa, AL. The Mobile Bay exerts an impressive influence on the
LA. The maximum monthly mean temperature generally climatic patterns of the section. The major differentiating
occurs in August but occurs in July at several stations. The characteristic of the insert is its high average annual rainfall,
minimum monthly mean temperature occurs in January at which ranges from 65.70 inches at Citronelle, AL, to 69.24
all stations. A characteristic that distinguishes this section inches at Robertsdale, AL. Otherwise, the Bay Insert’s rain-
from the Georgia uplands is the even greater divergence fall pattern is very similar to that of the Alabama-Mississippi
