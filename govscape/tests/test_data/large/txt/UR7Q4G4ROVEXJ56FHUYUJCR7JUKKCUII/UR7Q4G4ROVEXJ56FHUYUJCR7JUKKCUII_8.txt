Longleaf Pine Site Zones

Abstract The objectives of this study are to (1) identify and define the
climatic, physiographic, and edaphic differences in the long-
The authors delineate six major climatic areas of the longleaf pine (Pinus

of the six major climatic areas of the longleaf region be made with a seed
source from the same area.

Unfortunately, little is known of the effect of the environ-

management of longleaf pine forests.
