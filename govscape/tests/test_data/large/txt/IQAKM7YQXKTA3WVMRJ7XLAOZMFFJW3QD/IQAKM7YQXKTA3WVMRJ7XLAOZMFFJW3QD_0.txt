Description
General: Compass plant is a long lived perennial
member of the sunflower or composite family
(Asteraceae). The basal leaves and stems all arise
from an underground crown. A large reddish brown
tap root 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters (cm) is located just
below the crown, but rapidly looses diameter as it
descends into the soil (Weaver, 1954). The tap root
extends from 3 to 4 meters (m) deep into the soil with
a few branching roots extending out into a column of
soil from 2 to 3 m in diameter. Basal leaves of
younger plants are large (.6 m) deeply cut, angularly
lobed, clasping, hairy, and are oriented vertically
instead of horizontally. The leaf blades tend to point
