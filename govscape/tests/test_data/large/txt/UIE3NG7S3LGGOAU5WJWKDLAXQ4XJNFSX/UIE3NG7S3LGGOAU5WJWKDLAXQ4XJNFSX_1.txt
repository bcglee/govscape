ADAPTATION: Americus is tolerant of most upland sites. It is most productive on moderately
well to well drained soils. It shows potential for adaptation in coastal plain and piedmont in the
Southeast.
ESTABLISHMENT:
Indiangrass seed have appendages with fine hair and will not pass through conventional
equipment unless they can be ordered as “debearded” or brushed seed. Debearded seed may pass
through a conventional drill, though it may still be best to use a special drill designed for fluffy
seed. Seed drills advertised as “native grass drills” such as a Tye or Truax drill, have special
boxes equipped with picker wheels and augers which help prevent seed from sticking together
and move the seed to the drilling mechanism. Many native seed drills have multiple boxes,
which allow for the sowing of both switchgrass and fluffy seeded species at the same time.
Indiangrass should be seeded at ¼ to ½ inch deep. In sandy soils be especially careful not to
bury seed too deep! Planting native grasses with conservation tillage equipment is not
recommended at this time.
If a seed drill is not available, seed may be broadcast over a site. Broadcast fluffy seed
(indiangrass) with a drop spreader or cyclone spreader and then drag to lightly cover seed. If you
are using a cyclone spreader, try mixing seed with inert matter such as kitty littler or sawdust for
better spreading. Successful broadcast seeding can be achieved by increasing seeding rate and
by rolling or cultipacking before and after seeding. When planting a small area (1/4-acre) in
droughty conditions, an optional step to enhance the stand would involve lightly mulching the
seeded area.
SOILS: Americus is most productive and adapted to moderately well to well drained sites.
PLANTING DATE: Time of optimum planting can vary due to soils, latitude and elevation.
We recommend April 1- April 30 in the Piedmont and March 15 – May 15 in the Coastal Plain
as the normal optimal planting dates.
FERTILIZATION: Under low pH conditions, apply enough lime to raise pH to around 6.0.
After establishment and under a rotational grazing system in Southwest Georgia 600#/AC 10-10-
10 before grazing and 75#N/Ac after each grazing event for a maximum application of
210#N/Ac is applied.
SEEDING RATE: Broadcast 10 pounds pure live seed/acre, or 7-8 pounds pure live seed/acre
drilled.
PLANTING DEPTH: Under most conditions for best results plant approximately ¼ inch deep.
PLANTING EQUIPMENT: Planting can be accomplished with fertilizer spreaders followed by
cultipackers. Also Truax type native grass drills can be utilized.
MANAGEMENT: At establishment apply fertilizer according to soil test recommendations.
However, do not apply N fertilizer during indiangrass establishment. N application at this time
will encourage weed competition. Delay N fertilization until indiangrass is well established.
