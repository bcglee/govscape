Grazing of indiangrass is normally conducted 2-3 years after establishment.
The Jimmy Carter PMC recommends a rotational grazing system for proper utilization of this
grass. The rotational system should contain enough paddocks for a 25-30 day rotation cycle.
The grass in each paddock should be approximately 24 inches high before grazing. Each grazing
event should leave an average of 8-10 inches of minimal stubble for proper stand maintenance.
Also refer to the fertilization section for fertilization recommendation in rotational systems.
PRESCRIBED BURNING: Native warm season grasses are especially well adapted to
management with fire. A spring burn will remove old growth, recycle nutrients tied up in
standing dead vegetation, control brush invasion and produce a succulent forage for calves and
young stock. Prescribed burning is the most economical method to improve or maintain native
grasses. The best time to burn is from December through March. Check with the State Forestry
Commission before burning.
MOWING:
Mowing native warm-season grasses can also be an effective way of management. The best time
of year to mow is during the fall through late winter. Mow on a three-year cycle where 1/3 of
the area is mowed each year. Do not mow during the spring or summer months because of the
nesting season. When mowing, cut grass no lower than 6 inches and allow stubble to remain
until spring to help insulate plant roots and provide cover for wildlife. If native warm-season
grasses are cut lower than 6 inches during the active growing season, the stand will be reduced
significantly.
WEED CONTROL: Post-planting weed control requires prompt attention especially during the
establishment year. Inspect the planting every two to four weeks for weed pressure. Light
infestations of foxtail or broad-leaved weeds during the establishment year are generally not
considered to be a problem. Severe infestations of noxious or highly competitive weeds, such as
crabgrass, may require spot spraying with an herbicide such as glyphosate. There are a few
broadcast herbicides available to control weeds in native grass restoration plantings. Plateau  is
a relatively new herbicide labeled for most warm-season grasses, though switchgrass may be
sensitive to this herbicide. The use of glyphosate during the winter when warm-season grasses
are dormant may be useful for controlling cool-season species such as tall fescue. A combined
program of mowing, herbicides, and prescribed burning often provides the best results for
controlling weeds.
Weed Control the First Year: Mow the growing plants to a height of 8-10 inches during June,
July and August. This will slow the weeds but won’t harm the grasses. It is important to mow
early and often to assure adequate control. Mowing height should never be less than 6 inches.
Weed Control the Second Year: Evaluate the stand to determine if mowing for weed control is
necessary. If it is, mow to a height of 8-10 inches. For wildlife habitat, do not disturb during
nesting season.
If there is enough material for a spring burn, burning may be used for weed control. Spring
burns will tend to encourage warm-season species and work well to control cool-season plants.
