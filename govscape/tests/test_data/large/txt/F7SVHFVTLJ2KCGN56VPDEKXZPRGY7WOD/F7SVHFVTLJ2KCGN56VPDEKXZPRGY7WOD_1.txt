Sandberg bluegrass in the spring and it should be
grazed when it reaches eight inches in height.
Livestock graze Sandberg bluegrass in the vegetative
stage, but avoid it when headed. Livestock should be
removed while there is still enough moisture in the
ground to allow regrowth before plants go dormant.
Regrowth can be grazed after the plants turn green in
the fall, but a 6-inch stubble should be left.
Overgrazing and severe trampling are injurious to
native stands of this grass and without proper
protective grazing, a range will deteriorate rapidly.
New seedlings are easily pulled up by grazing
animals and, therefore, should not be grazed until the
stands are more than 2 years old and are sufficiently
well-rooted to withstand grazing. Spring and fall
