Description
Sandberg bluegrass is one of the native bluegrasses
and is an important component of the sagebrush
grassland vegetation in the western United States. It
is a medium-sized cool season bunchgrass with
numerous fine basal leaves 8 to 16 inches long.
These leaves are a smooth, deep blue green and are
folded with keel-shaped tips typical of bluegrasses.
This long-lived perennial reaches 2 to 4 feet in
height. Its inflorescence is a narrow panicle up to 8
inches long. It has a strong fibrous root system but
will occasionally develop short rhizomes. The flower
spikelets do not have a web of hairs at the base,
unlike Kentucky bluegrass, which does.
