AN EVALUATION OF FOUR FORBS FOR INCLUSION IN RANGE
SEEDING MIXES AND WILDLIFE FOOD PLOTS IN SOUTH TEXAS
INTRODUCTION
Texas range seeding mixes commonly include a mix of grasses and forbs.
Native, perennial forbs are commonly used in these range plantings. They are also
commonly used in wildlife food plots. Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) is
one of the most important native, perennial legumes currently used in Texas range
planting mixes. It is high in protein, readily eaten by both livestock and wildlife, and is
often used as an indicator of range condition (Ajilvsgi, 1984). Awnless bushsunflower
(Simsia calva) is another forb native to Texas. It has been used as forage for sheep
and goats (Soil Conservation Service – United States Department of Agriculture, 1988).
In addition, awnless bushsunflower has been found to be a good source of protein for
deer (Schweitzer, Bryant, & Wester, 1993).
Other native, warm-season forbs have also been shown to provide a palatable
food source for livestock and wildlife in Texas (Nelle, 1994). Orange zexmenia
(Zexmenia hispida), also known as hairy wedelia (Wedelia hispida), is a common,
native, warm-season, perennial forb. It is easily cultivated, and is often browsed by
deer, sheep, and goats (Ajilvsgi, 1984). Aphanostephus riddellii, commonly known as
perennial lazy daisy, has been found to be one of the most highly preferred food
sources for white-tailed deer (Arnold & Drawe, 1979; Everitt & Drawe, 1974). In fact,
Everitt and Drawe’s 1974 study found perennial lazy daisy to be the most preferred
spring food source of white-tailed deer, making up more than 12% of their early spring
diet. Arnold and Drawe’s study in 1979 found perennial lazy daisy to be “the second
most heavily preferred species” of white-tailed deer over the course of a year.
Kika de la Garza Plant Materials Center in Kingsville, Texas, has conducted field
evaluations using Illinois bundleflower, awnless bushsunflower, orange zexmenia, and
perennial lazy daisy. Each species was evaluated for survival, plant hardiness,
vegetative production, seed production, and other desirable characteristics. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate each forb for potential inclusion in range
seeding mixes and wildlife food plots for South Texas.
