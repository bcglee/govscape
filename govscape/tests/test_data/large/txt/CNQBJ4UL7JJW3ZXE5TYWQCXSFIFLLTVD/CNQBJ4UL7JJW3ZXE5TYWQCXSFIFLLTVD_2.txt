Plant Condition
Plant condition for the Illinois bundleflower could not be recorded, as no
specimens remained alive. The orange zexmenia and awnless bush sunflower were
both at the end of their growth cycle, providing only stale, dry forage material at this
time of year. The perennial lazy daisy was a pleasant surprise. It still had a lot of fresh
green vegetative growth. Its ability to produce tender green forage at times when most
other forbs are not, may be why it is such a highly preferred food source.
DISCUSSION
Much of the death loss in the awnless bushsunflower occurred in August of
1998. Most of the plants died suddenly, and upon examination it was noted that roots
were spongy-textured. Kleberg County Agricultural Extension Agent, John Ford,
confirmed the cause of death of the bush sunflower to be cotton root rot, a soil borne
virus. By the beginning of September, 1998, only two awnless bush sunflower
survived. A rancher would need to consider the susceptiblity to cotton root rot before
including awnless bushsunflower in his range seeding mix. The other forbs in the plot
appeared to be fairly resistant to the disease.
There was concern that the Illinois bundleflower would not be drought tolerant
enough to survive the hot, dry, South Texas summer, but it surprised us by producing
flowers and seed all the way through August. However, it began to die off during the
heavy rains of September, 1998. By mid-October no surviving Illinois bundleflower
plants remained. Although relatively drought tolerant, it appeared not to like extremely
wet conditions following the long period of drought. Orange zexmenia, perennial lazy
daisy, and the remaining awnless bushsunflower appeared to thrive under both wet and
dry conditions.
Of the four forbs, orange zexmenia appears to be the hardiest of the species and
also produced the most vegetation. It had 100 percent survival rate, and appears
highly drought and wet tolerant. It produced multiple new seedlings near the existing
plants. However, orange zexmenia tends to go dormant in early December. Perennial
lazy daisy also had a good survival rate and appears to be tolerant of both wet and dry
conditions. While it is a much smaller plant, it tends to produce new vegetative
growth on a fairly continuous basis. It can be a good source of forage at times when
other quality forage is scarce. It is also known to be a preferred source of food for
white-tailed deer.
It is our recommendation that the characteristics of the individual range site be
taken into account when choosing forbs to be included in a range seeding mix. A
rancher may wish to consider Illinois bundleflower for inclusion in a range seeding mix
if the planting site has well drained, sandier soils. Similarly, if the planting site has no
