MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Four Forb Plot consisted of four replications of four 15-foot sections of
bedded rows, each containing 15 plants of a different forb species. Locations of each
species within a replication were randomly selected. There is a five-foot wide alley
between each replication, and a border row of orange zexmenia transplants on either
side of the plot to control for an edge effect. Plants for this plot were grown individually
in the greenhouse in seeded cones. They were transplanted by hand into their
randomly assigned locations at one-foot intervals in April of 1998. They were irrigated
immediately following planting, and as needed throughout the growing season. Plants
were observed several times a month, and survival, hardiness, vegetative production,
and seed production were all recorded.
On December 1, 1998, all rows were evalauted for plant survival. In addition,
height and width measurements were taken from five randomly selected sample plants
from each row. The condition of the plants was also recorded at that time.
RESULTS
Plant Survival
Orange zexmenia had the highest survival rate of the four forbs included in the
plot, with 100 percent survival for all four replications. Perennial lazy daisy had the
second best survival rate. Two replications of lazy daisy had 100 percent survival,
while the other two replications had 93 percent and 86 percent survival, giving
perennial lazy daisy an average survival rate of 94 percent. The awnless
bushsunflower and Illinois bundleflower had very poor survival. The awnless bush
sunflower had only two surviving plants in one replication, leaving it with an average
survival rate of only 3 percent. The Illinois bundleflower did even worse, having no
surviving plants in the entire plot (Table 1).
Plant Size
Data on plant size was collected, not to compare species, but to provide an idea
of the growth potential of each species in South Texas. Orange zexmenia has a
rather shrubby growth form, and was the largest of the plants in the plot. It had an
average height of 2.28 feet and an average width of 4.26 feet. Awnless bushsunflower
was the next largest plant in the plot. The two surviving plants had an average height
of 1.7 feet and an average width of 2.65 feet. Illinois bundleflower would have been the
third largest plant in the plot; however, no data could be collected because there were
no surviving plants. Perennial lazy daisy is a short wide herbacious forb, and the
smallest of the forbs included in this study. It was found to have an average plant
height of .9250 feet and an average plant width of 2.155 feet (Table 2).
