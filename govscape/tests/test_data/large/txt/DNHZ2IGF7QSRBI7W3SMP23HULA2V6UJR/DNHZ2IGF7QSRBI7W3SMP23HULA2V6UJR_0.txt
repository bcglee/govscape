More Palouse Forbs for Landscaping.

The following is an additional list of native forbs which may be found in the Palouse region. These
forbs may be less suitable for the landscape because of growth habit, aggressiveness, difficulty in
propagating and growing, rarity, or it simply may be that we haven’t yet tried to do anything with
them. For a list of Palouse forbs which may be more suitable for landscaping and about which we
have more information to share, please see “Characteristics and Uses of Native Palouse Forbs in
Landscaping.”

Agastache urticifolia is probably too large a plant for a small garden. Requires a moist site. Easy to
grow from seed. Plants have a minty smell and a very interesting flower. Common names include
nettle-leafed giant hyssop, horsemint.
Agoseris grandiflora is not a particularly attractive plant, it looks rather like a weed. Short-lived and
attracts rodents, which eat the taproot and kill the plants. Easy to grow from seed, which is wind-borne
and goes everywhere. A good plant for a wild setting but probably not for a more formal landscape
situation. Sow in fall or early spring. Seed does not require stratification. Blooms in early summer.
Agoseris heterophylla is a small annual, probably not a good garden subject. Easy to grow from seed.
Likes a dry, open site. Seed is also wind-borne. Might be a good pioneer species in a more wild
situation.
Allium acuminatum is attractive in flower. Difficult to grow from seed and takes a long time to
flower. It is short and needs to grow where it is not overtopped at flowering time in late June. Leaves
wither by flowering time. Does well on shallow soils. Common names include Hooker’s onion, taper-
leaf onion.
Amsinckia spp. are native, but just being native does not preclude them from being nasty weeds. If
you have them in your garden, pull them up, but wear gloves. The plants are covered with short, stiff
hairs which penetrate the skin and are quite irritating. Common names usually include some form of
fiddleneck or tarweed.
Antennaria luzuloides is an interesting, low growing plant. Blooms early. Dried inflorescence is
interesting as well and could probably be used in dried flower arrangements. Seed seems to require
long stratification, but haven’t grown enough to be positive. Common name is woodrush pussytoes.
Antennaria microphylla prefers more mesic sites than A. luzuloides but blooms about the same time.
None of us have any experience with this plant. Other names include rosy pussytoes, Antennaria
rosea.
Arenaria congesta can pass for a grass at a cursory glance. It is interesting, but not particularly
stunning. Seeds appear to benefit from stratification. Likes dry sites. Common names include
capitate sandwort, ballhead sandwort, dense-flowered sandwort.
Asclepias speciosa sometimes has weedy connotations, although probably not deserved. It is an
important food for the monarch butterfly larva, which is rare on the Palouse, possibly because
