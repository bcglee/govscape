Silene douglasii is probably the best looking of all the native Catchflies. It has white flowers. Have
grown a few from seed, but the germination is never high. Common name is Douglas’ catchfly.
Silene scouleri is not very attractive even as plants of the genus Silene go. The white flowers bloom
late in the season and don’t last very long. Glandular hairs cover the plant and insects adhere to the
sticky substance, making it truly a catchfly. It’s interesting from that standpoint. Common name is
Scouler’s catchfly.
Silene spaldingii is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. It is a rare
species which only occurs in extreme eastern Washington and parts of northern Idaho and western
Montana. Under no circumstances should it be disturbed nor should any seed be removed from the
site. If you happen to find some plants, count yourself among the fortunate, take some photographs,
and leave the plants strictly alone. Common names include Spalding’s catchfly or Spalding’s silene.
Stellaria longipes, Stellaria crispa, and Stellaria nitens. We have no information or experience with
any of these species at present. Common names are long-stalked starwort, crisped starwort, and
shining chickweed, respectively.
Tonella floribunda is a small annual that resembles Collinsia parviflora. It has small blue flowers
with interesting patterns, but you need a hand lens to really appreciate them. Don’t see it much except
on the breaks of the Snake River. None of us have tried to grow it. Might be a good rock garden
subject. Common names include large-flowered tonella, many-flowered tonella.
Trillium ovatum has large white flowers which turn pink with age. They are low growing plants
which bloom in late April. Seeds of Trilliums are sometimes for sale in garden stores. They
apparently require 6-7 years to flower from seed. Some specialty nurseries sell plants. They need
moist shade and are usually a forest species. Common names include western trillium, wake-robin,
white trillium, birthroot.
Trillium petiolatum hides its flower under the leaves. The flower is dark purple and not as showy or
large as T. ovatum. Needs moist shade at least part of the day. More of a forest species but does
sometimes grow under hawthorns. Common names include round-leaved trillium, purple trillium,
petioled wake-robin.
Valeriana edulis is not a real charming plant. It is tall and rank with white flowers blooming in June.
Have grown a few plants, but can’t say we know what makes it germinate. Common names include
edible valerian, tobacco-root.
Vicia americana doesn’t seem to be very common. Has a few reddish legume flowers. As with most
legumes, the seed probably needs to be scarified. Common name is American vetch.
Viola adunca is a wonderful little plant with light purple flowers and a long spur. It should make a
good garden plant, but we haven’t tried to grow it. Finding it when the seed is ripe is difficult.
Common names include early blue violet, hooked violet, hookspur violet, western long-spurred violet.
Zigadenus venenosus always gets a bad rap for being poisonous and is probably not a good garden
subject for that reason, especially around children, even though the flowers are quite showy. White
flowers appear in a dense raceme in mid May. Grows from seed sown outdoors in the fall, either in
pots or in place. Takes several years to flower from seed. Common name is death camas.
