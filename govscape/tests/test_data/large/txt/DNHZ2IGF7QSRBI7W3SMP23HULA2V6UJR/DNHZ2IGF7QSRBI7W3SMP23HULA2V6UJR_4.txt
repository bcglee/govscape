Lupinus laxiflorus seed may hold in the pods longer than some of the other species of lupine. Haven’t
grown this one, but see no reason it wouldn’t be a good species. Other names include Lupinus
arbustus, spurred lupine.
Lupinus polyphyllus prefers mesic conditions, but sometimes occurs on drier sites. It is one of the
parents of the Russell lupines commonly grown in gardens but it did not survive in the xeriscape
garden at the University of Idaho Arboretum. Common names include bigleaf lupine, large-leaved
lupine.
Mertensia longiflora has pretty blue flowers on short, stocky plants. Blooms early in the season, then
goes dormant. None of us have tried this species, but it should be a good garden plant. Probably needs
stratification and cool growing conditions. Common names include long-flowered bluebells, long-
flowered Mertensia, trumpet lungwort.
Microseris nutans flowers are yellow and similar to a dandelion, but the plants are much better
behaved. The deeply toothed leaves are interesting. Grows easily from stratified seed. Plants with
low levels of competition grow large and flower over a long period, beginning in May. Seed is
windborne. Common name is nodding microseris.
Microsteris gracilis is an annual that reseeds itself. There is not much to recommend about this
species as a garden plant. It can be weedy but is usually so small it causes little harm. Seeds need to
be stratified or fall sown. Other names include pink microsteris, Gilia gracilis, Phlox gracilis.
Mimulus guttatus has tiny red spots on yellow flowers that look like snapdragons. Easy to grow from
seed without any pretreatment. Also spreads by stolons. It is an obligate wetland plant and needs to be
grown in a seep area or on the edge of a stream or pond. Will not survive on upland sites. Common
names include yellow monkey-flower, common monkey-flower.
Montia linearis is a small annual, not especially great looking, but it is interesting. None of us have
any experience with it. Probably requires stratification and is best sown in place. Other names include
narrowleaf miners lettuce, narrow-leaved montia, Claytonia linearis.
Montia perfoliata leaves wrap all the way around the stem. Flowers are small and white, not very
showy, but the leaves are interesting and they are edible. Likes some shade. Seeds should be fall
planted in place, as they need some stratification. Can be weedy. Other names include miner’s lettuce,
Claytonia perfoliata.
Navarretia intertexta and Navarretia squarrosa are prickly looking small annuals that are probably
best left out of a garden. Common names include narrow-leaved navarretia, needleleaf navarretia,
skunk-weed, skunkbush. Some older floras placed Navarretia in Gilia.
Orobanche uniflora is a parasite on the roots of other plants. The only time it comes above the ground
is to flower, which it does in late April and early May. Otherwise, one would never know it is around.
The flowers are purple and born on a short stalk about 4 inches tall. Don’t know how to grow it, but it
is probably best to sow seeds among suitable host plants. Common names include naked broomrape,
one-flowered broomrape, cancer drops, one-flowered cancer-root.
Orthocarpus tenuifolius is an annual plant very closely related to the paintbrushes. Flowers are
yellow and surrounded by pink bracts. The most attractive of the local owl clovers. It is a hemi-
parasite like Castilleja. Seed germination requirements are unknown, but it should probably be sown
with a host plant. Common name is thin-leaf owl-clover.
Penstemon venustus is found more frequently in the moister areas of Idaho, but also sometimes in the
upper elevations of the canyon grasslands. Has large purple flowers and serrated leaves. Tends to flop
over, so might need some support. Seeds need light to germinate so they should be surface sown.
“Clearwater” is a selected class release originating from the Clearwater River in Idaho. Common
names include elegant, lovely, Venus, and Clearwater penstemon.
Perideridia gairdneri flowers late in the season. The small white flowers are borne in compound
umbels. Leaves are pinnately compound with long, narrow leaflets and may wither by flowering time.
It grows each year from a thickened tuber-like portion of the root, which is edible and was prized by
Native Americans. Seeds germinate after stratification. May take several years to grow containerized
