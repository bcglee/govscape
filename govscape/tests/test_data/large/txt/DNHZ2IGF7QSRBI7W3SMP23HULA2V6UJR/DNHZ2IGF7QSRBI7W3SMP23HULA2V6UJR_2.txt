Crepis species might be good plants for dry sites. There are several species locally. Haven’t done
anything with them yet. Common name is hawksbeard.
Cypripedium fasciculatum and Cypripedium montanum are both forest species although C.
montanum does sometimes grow under hawthorn. Like most orchids, they are very difficult to grow.
No one should be collecting seed or plants of either one. Enjoy them where they occur and otherwise
leave them alone. Common names are clustered ladyslipper and mountain ladyslipper, respectively.
Dodecatheon pulchellum takes a while to grow and it needs space where it isn’t overtopped by other
plants early in the season, but it is beautiful when in flower. Grows from seeds planted outside in fall.
Transplants should be set out in the fall so they can begin growing while it is still too muddy to work
in the garden in early spring. Blooms in May and goes dormant by mid June. Common names
includes some variation of shooting star.
Epilobium angustifolium is definitely too aggressive for a garden. Might be useful in a wild setting.
The Palouse is the lower end of its ecological amplitude and it needs more moist sites to survive here.
Flowers are great and attract many species of bees. Starts blooming in late June and continues on
through July. Other names include Chamerion angustifolium, fireweed.
Erigeron corymbosus blooms in early July. Don’t know much about it at present. Erigerons seem less
aggressive than asters. Common names include long-leaved fleabane, foothill daisy.
Erigeron filifolius should be good for dry sites. Haven’t worked with this one. Common name is
thread-leaved fleabane.
Eriogonum heracleoides should be a great plant for a rock garden or a very dry area. The seed doesn’t
germinate at very high rates, but it can be grown from seed. Germination is higher after stratification.
It will flower the year following transplanting. Blooms in late June. The dried bracts hold their color
well and give the plant interest long after the actual flowering has been completed. Common names
include creamy buckwheat, Wyeth buckwheat, parsnip-flowered buckwheat.
Eriophyllum lanatum flowers are pretty and foliage is covered with short hairs so the whole plant is a
grey-green color except the yellow flowers. Haven’t tried this one either. It should do well on a dry
site. Blooms in June. Common name is Oregon sunshine.
Erythronium grandiflorum has great yellow flowers with reflexed petals (actually tepals) and
dangling dark red anthers. Blooms early in the season. Takes a while to grow from seed, but the wait
is worth it. Sow seeds in pots outdoors and leave them out there, but protect them from rodents.
Rodents eat the bulbs (and bears, too). Will not survive in a greenhouse. Bulbs are available from
mail-order nurseries. Common names include avalanche lily, glacier lily, snow lily, adders-tongue,
lamb’s tongue, dog-tooth violet.
Fragaria virginiana is more of a forest species but sometimes grows in moist hawthorn thickets.
Birds always get the fruit before you can. The seeds probably pass through the bird and are deposited
elsewhere, but that’s not a very effective or pleasant way to collect them. Common name includes
some form of strawberry.
Frasera albicaulis has great flowers, but the seed heads after flowering are nothing to write home
about. Flowers in early June. No information on seed germination. Common name is shining frasera.
Fritillaria pudica has nice yellow flowers early in the season. Takes 5-6 years to grow from seed to
flowering plants. Sow seeds in pots outdoors and leave them out there. Will not survive in a
greenhouse. Bulbs are available from some mail-order nurseries. Common names include yellow bell,
yellow fritillary.
Gentiana affinis seed germination is tricky but the flowers are worth the trouble. They bloom in late
July and on through August, so the plants need to grow on moist sites like north slopes. Common
name is prairie gentian.
Goodyera oblongifolia is a forest plant and member of the orchid family. It should not be collected.
Enjoy it where it grows and leave it alone. Common name is rattlesnake plantain.
