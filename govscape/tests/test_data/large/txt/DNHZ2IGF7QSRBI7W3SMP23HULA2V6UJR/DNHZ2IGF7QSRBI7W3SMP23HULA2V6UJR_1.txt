milkweed is not common. Can be grown from seed. It does spread by rhizomes and is probably too
aggressive for a small garden. Should be better in a more wild setting. Common name is showy
milkweed.
Aster jessicae is a large plant that may be too aggressive in a small garden or yard. Blooms very late
in the season and well grown plants will be covered with bluish flowers. Strongly rhizomatous. Needs
late season moisture and full sun. Plants grown in partial shade get leggy and are subject to mildew.
You should only grow this plant if you can get it from another gardener. It is a rare species and natural
populations should be left alone and enjoyed where they are. Other names include Jessica’s aster,
Symphyotrichum jessicae.
Astragalus arrectus is a rare species endemic to the Palouse. It should not be collected. Other names
include Palouse milkvetch, Astragalus palousensis.
Astragalus canadensis seed needs to be scarified. It is one of the most widely adapted species of
Astragalus. Weakly rhizomatous, blooms in June. Common name is Canada milkvetch.
Barbarea orthoceras is probably not a good garden subject. Needs a moist site. Blooms in the spring.
Common names include American watercress, American winter cress, American yellowrocket.
Calochortus elegans has a great flower but is easy to overlook because it is so short. Must be grown
from seed planted on site. Bulbs to not survive transplanting. Enjoy it where it grows and do not
attempt to move it. Common names include elegant sego lily, elegant mariposa lily, elegant star tulip,
hairy cat’s ear.
Calochortus macrocarpus has a wonderful flower but is easy to overlook when not in bloom because
the strap-like leaves don’t stand out by themselves. Flowers in July when other natives are beginning
to senesce, and is much taller than C. elegans. Must be grown from seed planted on site. Bulbs do not
survive transplanting. This one too should be enjoyed where it grows. Do not attempt to move it.
Common names include sagebrush mariposa or sego lily, green banded star-tulip.
Calochortus nitidus is rare and is possibly extirpated from Washington. Some populations still exist
in Idaho. If you are lucky enough to find it in the wild, take some photographs, but leave it strictly
alone. Common names include broad-fruit or big-fruit mariposa lily.
Calypso bulbosa is an orchid which grows in the forest. It is very difficult to grow and seeds will only
germinate in the present of the proper mycorrhizae. It cannot be transplanted. It is said that picking
the flower kills the plant. It should be enjoyed where it grows in the wild and left there. Common
names include fairy slipper, Venus-slipper, lady slipper
Castilleja miniata is one of many paintbrushes we haven’t tried, but it is supposed to be easier to grow
than the more xeric species. It is more of a forest species, but sometimes grows with Crataegus
douglasii (Douglas’ hawthorn). Might be a good plant for a lightly wooded area with enough
moisture. Common names include common paintbrush, scarlet paintbrush.
Cirsium brevifolium is probably not a good garden species. Spreads slowly from rhizomes. Also a
rare plant which is further threatened by a biocontrol agent which crossed over to this species from the
intended target. Leave it alone if you find it in the wild. Common name is Palouse thistle.
Claytonia lanceolata seems like it would be a good garden plant, but we haven’t done anything with it.
Seed propagation might be tricky. Blooms early in spring, then disappears until the next year. You
might want to mark the position of the plants so you don’t hoe or dig them up late in the season.
Common names include spring beauty, Indian potato.
Collinsia parviflora is a tiny little plant with great little flowers that bloom early in the spring. Seems
like it would be good sown around other plants for early color. Self sows readily but doesn’t persist
where it is overtopped early in the season. Seeds need to be sown in autumn for best results. While it
is a winter annual, some seeds will germinate in unusually cool springs, although the plants don’t
thrive like fall sown plants. Common name is blue-eyed Mary.
Comandra umbellata is an interesting plant but don’t know if it would grow in a garden. None of us
have any experience with it. It is at least partially parasitic on other plants. Also an alternate host for a
rust which attacks lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Common name is bastard toadflax.
