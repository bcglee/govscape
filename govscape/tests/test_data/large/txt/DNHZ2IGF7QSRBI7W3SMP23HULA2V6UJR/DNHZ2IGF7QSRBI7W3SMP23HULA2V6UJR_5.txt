stock to transplanting size. Stock is best outplanted in the fall when dormant. The plants grow tall and
may need support in a garden situation. Other names include Gairdner’s yampah, western yampah,
false caraway, Carum gairdneri.
Phacelia hastata and Phacelia heterophylla are probably not great garden subjects. Despite their
resemblance to the Borage family, they are actually members of the Hydrophyllaceae. The plants are
not very attractive. They grow tall and fall over, and the inflorescence is covered with irritating hairs
like the borages. Might be of more use in a wilder setting or for erosion control and stabilization
purposes. Easy to grow from seed and re-seeds itself readily. Biennials or short-lived perennials. Can
be spring sown, stratification does not increase germination. Common names are common or whiteleaf
phacelia and virgate or varileaf phacelia, respectively.
Plagiobothrys spp. are small annual borages with small white flowers. They prefer vernally wet sites.
Probably not good garden plants. Haven’t tried to collect seed or grow it. Common name is usually
some form of popcorn flower.
Plectritis macrocera is commonly called longhorn plectritis, white plectritis, or desert corn-salad.
None of us have any experience with this species.
Polemonium micranthum is another species for which we have no experience. Common names
include annual polemonium, Jacob’s ladder.
Polygonum douglasii is a slender annual plant with slender leaves and white flowers. Seems to prefer
rocky sites. Grows easily from seed, but stratification will increase germination. Might be best to sow
seed in place. Probably not a good garden subject, but an interesting plant for dry areas or possibly in
a rock garden. Common name is Douglas’ knotweed.
Polygonum majus. Don’t know anything about it. Common names include wiry knotweed, Palouse
knotweed.
Ranunculus glaberrimus plants stay low to the ground and often bloom in March. The shiny yellow
flowers are one of the first signs of spring. Once the seeds are mature, the plants senesce and it is
almost impossible to find them. You might want to mark the position of the plants so you don’t hoe or
dig them up late in the season. Seed germination requirements are not known. Common name is
sagebrush buttercup.
Ranunculus uncinatus seeds need stratification. Likes moist and/or shady places. Found under trees
and shrubs and along streams. Flowers in June. Common names include woods buttercup, woodland
buttercup, little buttercup.
Saxifraga integrifolia and Saxifraga nidifica aren’t seen very often. Don’t know anything about
them. Common names include some form of saxifrage.
Scrophularia lanceolata. Don’t know anything about it. Common name is lance-leaf figwort.
Scutellaria angustifolia is an interesting little plant with purple flowers. It likes dry, often rocky
places. Might be a good rock garden plant. We have no experience growing it. Common name is
narrow-leaf skullcap.
Scutellaria antirrhinoides is very similar to S. angustifolia, except it tends to be taller and the leaves
are somewhat wider. Likes the same habitats, but found in more mesic habitats as well. Common
name is snapdragon skullcap.
Sedum stenopetalum seems like it would be a good species for the rock garden, but we haven’t
worked with it. Flowers in early June. It is supposedly possible to propagate from stem cuttings.
Common names include wormleaf stonecrop, Douglas’ stonecrop.
Senecio integerrimus is certainly not a very beautiful plant. Grows and flowers early in the season,
then goes dormant by summer. May be short-lived. Seeds need extended stratification to germinate
and cool growing conditions to survive. Grow in full sun. Common name is western groundsel.
Senecio serra is better looking than its cousin S. integerrimus, but it spreads readily in suitable habitats
and can be invasive. Much too aggressive for the average garden. Might be useful in a moist wild or
semi-wild area. Masses of yellow flowers bloom in late June or early July. Common name is serrated
groundsel.
