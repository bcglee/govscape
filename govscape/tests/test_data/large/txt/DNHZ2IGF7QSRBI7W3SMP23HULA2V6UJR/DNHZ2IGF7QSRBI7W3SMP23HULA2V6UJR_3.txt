Grindelia squarrosa is a weedy native biennial or short-lived perennial which probably has no place in
a garden setting but might be a component of a wilder planting. Drought tolerant. Common names
include resin-weed and curly-cup gumweed.
Habenaria elegans, Habenaria unalascensis and any other rein-orchids are members of the orchid
family which grow in dappled shade under shrubs and Ponderosa pine. They should be enjoyed where
they grow and left alone. Do not collect seed from them.
Haplopappus carthamoides is not a very attractive garden plant. The bare calyx after the seeds have
been shed is more attractive than the flowers. Seed predators are common. Other names include large-
flowered goldenweed, Columbia goldenweed, Pyrrocoma carthamoides.
Haplopappus liatriformis flowers are more attractive than H. carthamoides. Blooms late in the
season. Individual plants are rather spindly, but it looks better in groups. Seems to be short-lived.
This is a rare species endemic only to the Palouse Prairie. It occurs nowhere else in the world. Do not
collect seed or plants. Other names include Palouse goldenweed, Pyrrocoma liatriformis.
Hydrophyllum capitatum is an interesting little plant for shady areas. It flowers, then goes dormant
rather early in the season. Mark the plants so you don’t hoe or dig them up by accident during the
summer and fall. Germination requirements are unknown, but it probably needs to be sown in the fall
outdoors. Common names include ballhead waterleaf, wool breeches.
Hydrophyllum fendleri likes moist shade but sometimes occurs in sunnier places, where it is usually
shorter and more compact than shaded plants. Common name is Fendler’s waterleaf.
Idahoa scapigera silicles are attractive. Flowers are inconspicuous. An annual which likes dry sites.
It blooms and dries up early in the season. Common names include Idahoa, scalepod, pepperpod.
Lathyrus bijugatus and several other native species of Lathyrus aren’t seen very often. Don’t know
much about them. Common name is some form of peavine.
Lithophragma bulbifera and Lithophragma parviflora both have charming white flowers on tiny
plants that bloom early in the spring, then disappear. Mark the position of the plants so you don’t hoe
or dig them up late in the season. Seed needs long stratification and cool growing conditions. In the
wild, most plants remain vegetative in any given year, only a few bloom. Might bloom more often in a
garden. Can also be grown from bulblets produced on the roots of both species and also at the base of
the petiole in L. bulbifera. Should be good rock garden subjects. Common names include prairie-star,
fringecup, rocketstar, woodlandstar, baby face.
Lithospermum ruderale is often pretty scraggly in the wild, but can be an attractive plant in an
ornamental setting. It is a member of the Borage family and has the typical irritating hairs of many
borages. Difficult to grow from seed. Flowers are small and pale yellow, opening in May, not very
showy. The plant has an interesting color and form and the seeds are very hard, white nutlets.
Common names include western gromwell, Columbia puccoon, cat’s tooth, lemonweed.
Lomatium farinosum is a very early species found mostly in the canyon grasslands. Uncommon
elsewhere. Native Americans ground the roots into a meal, thus the species name. Sometimes called
Coeur d’Alene lomatium or biscuitroot.
Lomatium gormanii has brilliant white flowers with purple anthers that give it the common name “salt
and pepper.” It thrives in rocky areas by growing during the winter. During a mild spell in December
or January it will often bloom. Should be a great rock garden plant.
Lomatium grayi is not the best looking of the lomatiums, but seems to be the most widely adapted.
Blooms in April. Seeds germinate after long stratification. Like all lomatiums, it goes dormant early.
Common name is Gray’s lomatium or biscuitroot.
Lomatium macrocarpum has grey-green foliage and white flowers which make it an interesting plant.
Likes dry, rocky places where it flowers in April. Grows readily from seed after long stratification.
Common names include grey lomatium, bigseed lomatium, large-fruited lomatium or biscuitroot.
Lotus purshianus is a small annual with yellow and pink flowers. Seems to grow in a variety of
places, but we no experience with it. Pods twist open explosively when ripe and scatter seed.
Common name is Spanish clover.
