DOMESTIC SAMPLING RESULTS
SCHEDULED SAMPLING â€“ EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS
(CONDENSED AND REFORMATTED RESULTS)
Domestic scheduled sampling condensed and reformatted results are presented in two
tables (a and b) for each compound class tested unless there is only one compound in the
class, then the second table is not necessary. The first table states the total number of
animals analyzed (or the number of composite samples in the case of poultry), the
number of non-violative positives (compounds detected at a level equal to or below the
established tolerance), the number of violations, and the percent violations, for each
compound class. Since analyses for multiple compounds can be performed on the same
sample, one sample (one animal or a composite from one poultry flock) could have more
than one violation. The second table presents the specific compounds that were detected
within the compound class. The data on violations reported here should not be summed
across either production class or analysis with the intent of arriving at a single value to
represent the percentage occurrence of violations over all the species that were tested
using a given analysis. This mathematical operation will not produce a statistically valid
estimate, given the sample design in use. Care must be taken when making statistical
inferences from these data.
ANTIBIOTICS (7-plate bioassay)
FSIS analyzed 3,556 samples for antibiotic residues. Twenty four (24) violations were
detected in 24 animals from several production classes. The residue violations consisted
of eight (8) gentamicin, fourteen (14) neomycin, one (1) oxytetracycline, and one (1)
penicillin. Table 4a, Antibiotics, presents the results of the testing by production class.
Table 4b, Specific Antibiotic Violative Residues, presents the specific antibiotics detected.
