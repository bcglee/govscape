FSIS analyzed 291 market hogs samples for 2-thiouracil, 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, 6-proply-
2-thiouracil, 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (tapazole), 6-phenyl-2-thiouracil, and 2-
mercaptobenzimidazole residues; zero (0) violations and zero (0) non-violative positives
were detected. The 95th confidence interval for percent violations is: 0, 1.26.
