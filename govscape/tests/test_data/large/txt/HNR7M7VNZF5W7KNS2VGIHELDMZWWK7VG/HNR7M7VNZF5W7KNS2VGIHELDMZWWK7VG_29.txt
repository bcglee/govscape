CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS, CHLORINATED
ORGANOPHOSPHATES, and PYRETHROIDS
FSIS analyzed 2,645 samples for chlorinated hydrocarbons and chlorinated
organophosphates. Samples with chromatograms containing peaks with retention times in
the pyrethroid area were further analyzed using an ad hoc method for pyrethroids. Twelve
(12) violations were detected. The residue violations consisted of one (1) dieldrin, three
(3) hexachlorobenzenes (HCB), three (3) polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), three (3)
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), one (1) halowax, and one (1) permethrin. Table
10a, Chlorinated Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated Organophosphates, and Pyrethroids
presents the results of the testing by production class. Table 10b, Specific Chlorinated
Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated Organophosphates, and Pyrethroids presents the specific
chlorinated hydrocarbons, chlorinated organophosphates, and pyrethroids detected.
