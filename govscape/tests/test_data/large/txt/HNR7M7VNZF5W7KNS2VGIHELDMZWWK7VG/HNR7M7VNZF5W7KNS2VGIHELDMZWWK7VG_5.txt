INTRODUCTION
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s public
health regulatory agency, works with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Department of Health and Human Services’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to control
veterinary drug, pesticide, and environmental contaminant residues in meat, poultry, and egg
products. Residue control is a cooperative effort. EPA* and FDA** have statutory authority for
establishing residue tolerances or action levels, and FSIS, through the National Residue Program
(NRP) tests animal tissues and egg products to verify that tolerances or action levels are not
violated.
FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, establishes tolerances or action levels for
veterinary drugs, food additives, and unavoidable environmental contaminants. EPA, through
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (as modified by the Food Quality
Protection Act), sets tolerance levels for registered pesticides. For cancelled pesticides, action
levels (similar to tolerances, but less formal) are established by FDA based on recommendations
that EPA published in the Federal Register. FDA and EPA also have the authority to ensure
compliance with established tolerances or action levels.
FSIS collects samples of meat, poultry, and egg products at inspected establishments and
analyzes the samples at FSIS laboratories for chemical residue of veterinary drugs, pesticides,
and environmental contaminants. Laboratory findings that exceed established tolerances and
action levels are shared with FDA and EPA. This authority is provided under the Federal Meat
Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act. FSIS
regulations are published in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), chapter III.
Since 1967, FSIS has administered the NRP to collect data on chemical residues in domestic and
imported meat, poultry, and egg products. The NRP is designed to provide: (1) a structured
process for identifying and evaluating compounds of concern by production class; (2) the
capability to analyze for compounds of concern; (3) appropriate regulatory follow-up of reports
of violative tissue residues; and (4) collection, statistical analysis, and reporting of the results of
these activities.
With the implementation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)
inspection system, another important component of the NRP is to provide verification of residue
control in HACCP systems. As part of the HACCP regulation, slaughter and production
establishments are required to identify all chemical residue hazards that are reasonably likely to
occur, and develop systems to guard against them. A vigilant chemical residue prevention
program is essential to foster the prudent use of veterinary drugs and pesticides in food animals.
In 1999, the NRP was modified to make residue evaluation more consistent with risk assessment
principles.
* Tolerance levels established by EPA are published in Title 40 CFR.
** Tolerance levels established by FDA are published in Title 21 CFR.
