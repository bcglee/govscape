*FSIS employs techniques and principles from the field of risk assessment to determine
the relative public health concerns represented by the results from the scheduled sampling
plan-exposure assessments. The information on the residue levels detected in the
scheduled sampling plan is combined with consumption data to estimate exposure.
Exposure = Consumption Data x Residue Levels
