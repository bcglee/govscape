Exposure Assessments
Exposure Assessments are used:
(cid:131) By FSIS, FDA, and EPA to determine the prevalence of residues in
the Nationâ€™s meat, poultry, and egg products;
(cid:131) By FSIS to condemn carcasses with violative levels of residue;
(cid:131) By FDA to regulate producers when a sample contains violative
levels of residues;
(cid:131) By industry to retain product until the sample has been tested; and
(cid:131) By industry to recall product that was not retained while the
sample was tested, and found to contain violative levels of residue.
Exploratory Assessments
Exploratory Assessments are designed by Residue Branch:
(cid:131) To reinvestigate animal populations from ongoing or previous
exposure assessments if the violation rate is confirmed at 1 percent
or greater;
(cid:131) To investigate animal populations when the compounds in question
have no established tolerances; and
(cid:131) To respond to intelligence reports from the field.
All products are FSIS retained and subject to condemnation.
Inspector Generated Sampling
Inspector generated sampling is conducted by in-plant Public Health
Veterinarians (PHVs) using FSIS Form 10,000-2. This occurs when the in-plant
PHV suspects that an animal may have violative level of chemical residues.
Currently, inspector generated sampling targets individual suspect animals and
suspect populations of animals. When an inspector generated sample is collected,
the carcass is held pending the results of laboratory testing and if a carcass is
found to contain violative levels of residues the carcass is condemned.
Sampling for individual suspect animals
The in-plant inspector selects a carcass for sampling based on professional
judgment and public health criteria developed by FSIS. These criteria
include but are not limited to the following: animal disease signs and
symptoms; producer history; or results from random scheduled sampling.
Some samples are screened in the plant by the Inspector In Charge (IIC)
and verified when necessary by a PHV. Other samples are sent directly to
the laboratory for analysis. For example, if the IIC suspects the misuse of
either an antibiotic or sulfonamide drug in an animal, then he or she can
perform one of the following in-plant screening tests: Fast Antimicrobial
Screening Test (FAST) or Swab Test On Premises (STOP). If the result of
a screening test is positive, then the sample is sent to an FSIS laboratory
