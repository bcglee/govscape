SCHEDULED SAMPLING – EXPOSURE
ASSESSMENTS DATA FROM FSIS DATABASE
Tables 17a to 37b identify information as received from the FSIS Database System,
Microbiological and Residue Computer Information System (MARCIS).
PRODUCTION CLASS DATA
Tables 17a to 37a present the tissues analyzed, number of samples analyzed, number of
violations, and the range for the amount detected for each compound tested in each
production class. The number of positives and violations are reported in intervals, with
the lowest interval being 0.01-0.10 ppm or 0.01-0.10 ppb. If samples did not contain
detectable residues, then the samples are categorized under “None” for “Amount in
Sample.” The no-detect level varies for each analyte and is not <0.01 ppm or <0.01 ppb
for every analyte. The limits of detection may be found in Appendix I (Analytical
Methods, 2005 National Residue Program). The last two columns indicate instances
when samples were analyzed and residues were detected but not quantitated.
Tables 17b to 37b present the number of samples analyzed, number of violations, percent
violative samples, and the upper 95% confidence limit for each compound class in each
production class. The columns “Percent Violative Samples” and “Upper 95% Confidence
Limit” provide an estimate of the percent violations and the associated upper 95%
confidence limit on the percent of specified animals (groups of six animals for poultry)
with a violation in at least one compound in the residue compound class listed.
