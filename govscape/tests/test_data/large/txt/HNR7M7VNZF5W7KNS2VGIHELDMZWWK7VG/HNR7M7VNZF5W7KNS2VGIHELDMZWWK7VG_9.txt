for confirmation. If the IIC does not have FAST or STOP capability, the
sample can be sent directly to the FSIS laboratory for testing.
Sampling for suspect animal populations
Sampling for suspect animal populations is generally directed by an FSIS
regulation, directive (e.g., FSIS Directive 10,800.1), or notice (e.g., show
animals and bob veal).
IMPORT REINSPECTION SAMPLING PLAN
Imported meat, poultry, and egg products are sampled at U.S. ports of entry to detect
chemical residues. Port-of-Entry Reinspection is a monitoring program conducted to
verify the equivalence of inspection systems in exporting countries. The chemical
residue sampling program is one of several Types Of Inspection (TOI) conducted during
FSIS reinspection of imported products. All imported products are subject to
reinspection and one or more TOIs are conducted on every lot of product before it enters
the United States. The following are the three levels of chemical residue reinspection:
• Normal sampling, which is defined as random sampling from a lot;
• Increased sampling, which is defined as above the normal sampling as the result
of an Agency management decision; and
• Intensified sampling, which is defined as occurring when a previous sample for a
TOI failed to meet U.S. requirements.
For both normal and increased sampling, the lot is not required to be retained pending
laboratory results; however, the importer may choose to retain the lot pending the
laboratory results. The lot is subject to recall if it is not retained and is found to contain
violative levels of residue. For intensified sampling, the lot must be retained pending
laboratory results. The data obtained from laboratory analysis are entered into the
Automated Import Information System (AIIS), an FSIS database that is designed to
generate reinspection assignments, receive and store results, and compile histories for the
performance of foreign establishments certified by the inspection system in the exporting
country.
