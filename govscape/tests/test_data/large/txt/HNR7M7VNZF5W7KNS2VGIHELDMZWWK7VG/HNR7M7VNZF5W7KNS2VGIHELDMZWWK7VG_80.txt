FAST ANTIMICROBIAL SCREEN TEST (FAST)
FSIS used FAST to screen 73,042 animals for antibiotic, and sulfonamide residues. In addition,
samples found to be FAST positive for antibiotics or sulfonamides were further analyzed for
flunixin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound. FSIS laboratories confirmed 1,255
violations in 1,159 animals. There were two (2) amikacin, 12 ampicillin, 10 dihydrostreptomycin,
148 gentamicin, one (1) kanamycin, 144 neomycin, 59 oxytetracycline, 422 penicillin, 18
tetracycline, 42 tilmicosin, one (1) tylosin, four (4) sulfadiazine, 180 sulfadimethoxine, 66
sulfamethazine, four (4) sulfamethoxazole, three (3) sulfathiazole, and 139 flunixin residue
violations. Table 40a, Fast Antimicrobial Screen Test, presents the screening test results by
production class. Table 40b, Specific FAST Violative Residue, presents specific results for
antibiotic, sulfonamide, and flunixin residues.
