The NRP includes a variety of sampling plans to identify violative levels of chemical residues
and to reduce the consumers’ exposure to chemical contaminants. The range of chemical
compounds evaluated for inclusion in the various NRP sampling plans is comprehensive. It
includes approved (legal) and unapproved (illegal) veterinary drugs, pesticides that may appear
in meat, poultry, and egg products, and other xenobiotic and naturally occurring compounds that
may pose a potential human health hazard.
A violation in a production class (food animal or egg product) occurs when a chemical residue is
detected and the residue is in excess of an established tolerance or action level. The collection of
samples is either scheduled from Headquarters (scheduled sampling) or initiated by the
inspector-in-charge (inspector generated sampling). In scheduled sampling, samples are collected
from healthy appearing animals and the findings provide exposure assessment data. The majority
of the NRP sampling is conducted under inspector generated sampling. These samples are
collected in establishments from suspect animals; their carcasses are retained and condemned if a
violative level of chemical residue is found. FSIS notifies FDA of the violation and assists in
obtaining the names of producers and, in the case of food animal products, other parties involved
in offering the animals for sale.
FDA and cooperating state agencies will follow-up on known violators with educational visits. If
a problem is not corrected, subsequent FDA visits could result in enforcement action, including
prosecution. FSIS posts a Repeat Violator List on its agency’s web site, listing the names and
addresses of parties FDA has determined are responsible for more than one veterinary drug,
pesticide, or other chemical residue violation in a 12-month period. The list provides helpful
information to processors and producers working to avoid illegal levels of residues, serves as a
deterrent for violators, and enables FSIS to make better use of resources.
Data gathered in the NRP is used to verify the safety of meat, poultry, and egg products in the
United States. The program helps FSIS, FDA, and EPA enforce Federal laws and regulations,
and assists in the design of programs to enhance the nation’s residue control programs.
