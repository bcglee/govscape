SAMPLING PLANS OF THE NATIONAL RESIDUE
PROGRAM
The National Residue Program (NRP) consists of two primary sampling plans: domestic
and import. These plans are further divided to facilitate the management of chemical
residues such as veterinary drugs, pesticides, and environmental contaminants in food
animals and egg products. The domestic sampling plan includes scheduled sampling and
inspector generated sampling. The import reinspection sampling plan is separated into
normal sampling, increased sampling, and intensified sampling.
DOMESTIC SAMPLING PLAN
Scheduled Sampling
Scheduled sampling plans consist of the random sampling of tissue from healthy
appearing food animals. Scheduled sampling plans are generated from FSIS
Headquarters using the FSIS Form 10,210-3. The development of scheduled
sampling plans is a process that proceeds in the following manner: 1) determine
which compounds are of food safety concern; 2) use algorithms to rank the selected
compounds; 3) pair these compounds with appropriate production classes; and
4) establish sample sizes. The Surveillance Advisory Team (SAT) at their annual
meeting determines the compound/production class pairs. The FSIS Residue Branch
staff determines the sample sizes by employing statistical analysis techniques to
calculate sample numbers. In the 2006 NRP, FSIS started using sample sizes of
either 230 or 300 animals for each compound/production class pair. Statistically,
applying sampling rates of 230 and 300 per production class population assures a 90
percent and 95 percent probability, respectively, to detect residue violations if the
violation rate in the population is equal to or greater than one percent. Residue
Branch has adopted a sample size of 300 as a public health standard. This sample
size and resulting violation data are used to verify two different types of process
control. The first is to verify that industry’s process controls meet this public health
standard for the compound/production class pairs being tested. The second is to
verify that the establishments’ HACCP plans are in control. Finally, reviews and
final adjustments to these sampling plans are made by FSIS Senior Management,
FSIS laboratories staff, FDA, and EPA. The following types of assessments are
currently being scheduled:
