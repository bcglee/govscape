a. Minimum Proficiency Level: The minimum concentration of a residue at which an analytical result will be used to assess a laboratory's quantification
capability. This concentration is an estimate of the smallest concentration for which the average coefficient of variation (CV) for reproducibility (i.e., combined
within and between laboratory variability) does not exceed 20 percent (9 CFR 318.21).
b. The presence of banned compounds and compounds at violative levels are confirmed using confirmatory methodology
c. 4-methylaminoantipyrine, 4-formylaminoantipyrine, and 4-aminoantipyrine
