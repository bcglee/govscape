INSPECTOR GENERATED SAMPLING-
SUSPECT ANIMALS
Inspector generated sampling of suspect animals is conducted by in-plant Public Health
Veterinarians (PHVs) when it is suspected that an animal may have violative level of chemical
residues. Samples collected could be screened in the plant using Fast Antimicrobial Screen test
(FAST) or Screen Test On-Premises (STOP). If the PHV does not have FAST or STOP capability,
the sample can be sent directly to the FSIS laboratory for testing.
Inspector generated sampling results are presented in two tables for each specific analysis unless
there is only one compound tested. The first table (a) states the total number of animals analyzed,
the number of violations, and the percent violations for each production class. Since analyses for
multiple compounds can be performed on the same sample, one sample (one animal) could have
more than one violation. The second table (b) identifies the results for specific compounds that
were detected within the compound class.
SAMPLES SCREENED IN-PLANT AND CONFIRMED IN A FSIS
LABORATORY
SWAB-TEST ON PREMISES (STOP)
FSIS used STOP to screen 6,654 animals for antibiotic, and sulfonamide residues. FSIS
laboratories confirmed 21 violations in 20 animals. There were three (3) gentamicin, four (4)
penicillin, one (1) chlortetracycline, one (1) neomycin, three (3) oxytetracyline, one (1)
sulfadimethoxine, and eight (8) sulfamethazine residue violations. Table 39a, Swab Test on
Premises, presents the screening test results by production class. Table 39b, Specific STOP
Violative Residue, presents specific results for antibiotic, sulfonamide, and non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drug residues.
