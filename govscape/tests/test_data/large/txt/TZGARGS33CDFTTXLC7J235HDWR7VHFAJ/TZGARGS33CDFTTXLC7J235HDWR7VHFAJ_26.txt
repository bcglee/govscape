The suspension is not effective immediately. Instead',
the law affords registrants an opportunity to request an
expedited hearing within 5 days of receiving notice from
the Administrator that he intends to suspend. If an
expedited hearing is not requested'', the Administrator may
implement the suspension by issuing an order. However1,
before issuing the order1, the Administrator must begin
.cancellation proceedings if he has not already done so.
(This is because suspension is an interim remedy and can be
effective only for the duration of cancellation proceedings.)
If an expedited hearing is requested11, the statute
requires that it begin promptly. The sole issue at this
hearing is whether an imminent hazard exists. .,.
The presiding officer'1, or hearing panel'1, has 10 days
after completion of the hearing to submit findings and a
recommendation to the Administrator. The Administrator
has 7 days to decide whether to affirm the imminent hazard
determination; if he does', a final suspension order is
issued. The final suspension order is reviewable in the
Court of Appeals.
The pesticide(s) in question may be marketed during
the time it takes to complete the expedited hearing.
4) Emergency Suspension Proceedings
This proceeding begins with a finding that an
imminent hazard exists and that an emergency exists --
that the situation is so critical that the Administrator
does not have time to hold a hearing before suspending.
(In other words', the Administrator finds that unreasonable
risks would be posed by continued use of the pesticide
during a suspension hearing.)
An emergency suspension order is issued without
prior notice to registrants and takes effect immediately.
The Order must be accompanied by a notice beginning
cancellation proceedings, unless they are already in progress
