Let me show you what we found.
First, you see the numbers of pounds of 2,4,5-T
used in the area. As you can see, almost all
of the herbicide is used in the months of
March and April;
Second (first overlay) here is a line repre-
senting the miscarriages occurring in the
study area. Comparing the line with the
2,4,5-T bar graphs, you see that the miscarriage
rate appears to be correlated to the amount of
2,4,5-T sprayed. Notice this dramatic peak
in June which follows the heaviest use of the
herbicide by only 2 months. This peak occurred
consistently in each year examined.
And third, (second overlay) the June peak is not
present for the control group. Indeed, the
control group data shows a generally lower rate
of miscarriages altogether.
Obviously, we are very concerned about the health
implications of these findings not only for the residents
of Oregon but to all citizens who may be exposed to the
herbicide. We estimate that over 4 million people across
the Nation may be at risk through the use of the herbicide
in forestry, rights-of-way clearance, and pasture uses.
