Although they do not.receive advance notice1, registrants
may still request an expedited hearing within five days
to determine whether the suspension order should remain in
place for the duration of the cancellation proceeding.
In other words', the emergency order only applies during the
expedited suspension hearing1, if one is requested. The
Administrator may lift the emergency order8, modify it,
or keep it in place for the duration of the cancellation
heari ng.
Unlike "regular" suspension11, only the registrant and
the Agency may participate in the expedited hearing; others
may present briefs. The presiding officer or hearing
panel has 10 days from the conclusion of the hearing to
submit findings and recommendations to the Administrator.
The Administrator then has 7 days to issue a final order
on the issue of suspension. A final order "on suspension
after a hearing before the Agency", may be reviewed in the
Court of Appeals.
Producers may appeal an emergency suspension order
to a Federal District Court which reviews only whether the
emergency finding is supported. The District Court order
may be appealed to the Appellate Court by either the Agency
or the registrant.
************************
Suspension1, it should be remembered'1, involves a
preliminary assessment of evidence and probabilities', not
an ultimate resolution of the larger question of the risks
and benefits of the pesticide to society over the long
run. That larger question is addressed in the cancellation
proceedings. The Courts have found in the past that for a
suspension action1, "It is enough if there is a substantial
1ike1ihood [emphasis in original] that serious harm will
be experienced during the year or two required in any
realistic projection of the administrative (cancellation)
process" [Environmental Defense Fund11, Inc. vs. Envi ronmental
Protection Agency; 465 F2d 540 (D.C. Cir 1972)].
