Numerous laboratory tests in several animal species
reveal similar reproductive problems with 2,4,5-T. "There
are considerable data on the health effects of 2,4,5-T
in animal tests which are predictive of the same human
health effects we are seeing in Alsea," said Blum.
2,4,5-T is contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin (TCDD), which even at very low levels, produce
birth defects, miscarriages, and tumors in laboratory
animals.
"Taken together, all these facts sound an alarm.
Prudence dictates EPA to stop use until we have a fuller
understanding of this phenomenon and its implication
for human health," said Blum.
2,4,5-T was first registered in 1948 as a herbicide
for control of broadleaf weeds. Acting in 1970 on the basis
of the animal tests, the Federal Government halted those uses
to which there was a high probability of pregnant women
being exposed: home and garden, recreational area, and aquatic
sites. All food uses', except for rice which was appealed
by the manufacturer11, were halted as well.
Since that time, the herbicide has been used against
unwanted vegetation primarily in forest management (2.6
million pounds used annually on 1.16 million acres),
rights-of-way clearance (3.8 million pounds used annually
on' 683,000 acres), pastureland (500 thousand pounds on
1 million acres), rangeland (2 million pounds on 1.7
million acres), and rice (300 thousand pounds on 300,000
acres). Forresters regard the herbicide as a valuable
tool in reforestation and in encouraging conifer growth
(by eliminating hardwoods which compete for light and
nutrients), and in allowing maintenance access to power
1i nes.
There have been years of debate about the safety
of these uses of 2,4,5-T. In April 1978 EPA issued a
rebuttable presumption against registration (RPAR) on
2,4,5-T, which solicited public input on the risks and
benefits of the herbicide. That review of rice and range-
land uses will continue during the suspension proceedings.
