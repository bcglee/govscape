The emergency suspension action we are taking today
will protect the nearly 4 million people who may be unknowingly
and involuntarily exposed as a result of those uses. The
potential for significant human exposure, the warning signals
from the Alsea study, the preponderance of strong animal
test data, and the low short-term economic impact, compel
this unusual emergency action.
The new study was initiated by EPA because of complaints
from women in Alsea reporting that they had experienced
miscarriages right after the forest area in which they lived
was sprayed with 2,4,5-T. The study was completed by
scientists from the Environmental Health Institute of
Colorado State University and the University of Miami Medical
School, Department of Public Health and Epidemiology. It
compared the miscarriages in the Alsea basin area of western
Oregon with those of women in a control area in eastern
Oregon. These findings, spanning a six year period, were
then correlated with the spraying of 2,4,5-T in the State.
The Alsea basin is in a national forest area of Oregon which
is sprayed each spring with 2,4,5-T. The control group was
from a similar rural area in the eastern part of the state
which is not sprayed with the herbicide.
