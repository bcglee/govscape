"This emergency action only suspends use until the
risks and benefits can be more fully evaluated1," said
Blum. "We have considerable data on the long term economic
benefits' of 2,4,5-T. The extensive analysis and data
from the manufacturers and users and the USDA/State/EPA
benefits assessment team in the RPAR procedure will be
very valuable as we continue these deliberations. The
groundwork laid in the public commant period will be
'instrumental in reaching as rapid and fair a final conclusion
of this difficult question as possible."
"The short-term economic impact of this action -- i.e.,
suspension of uses over the period the expedited hearing
and the cancellation proceedings -- should not be serious.
This is so because alternatives are available for pasture
and rights-of-way uses, and because only a tiny fraction of
commercial forest acres are treated in any given year.
Moreover, in many cases treatment can be deferred until these
proceedings are completed. The long-term economic impacts
will be fully evaluated -- along with the long-term health
risks -- in the cancellation proceedings.
In a corollary action, EPA is also suspending related
uses of si"! vex", another herbicide contaminated by TCDD,
to preclude similar exposure^; especially since silvex could
be used as an alternative to the suspended 2,4,5-T uses.
Silvex is used primarily for weed control on suburban lawns
and other turf. Several alternatives are available for this
use.
Any sale1, distribution, or use of a suspended pesticide
during the period of its suspension is illegal and may
be punished by substantial penalties. The Agency will be
issuing Stop Sale, Use", or Removal Orders to all registrants
and distributor registrants of 2,4',5-T and silvex,
as well as to all establishments which produce 2,4,5-T or
silvex. EPA is requesting the cooperation of States in
assuring that the Suspension Order is followed. Persons
who hold quantities of these products^ must stop any further
distribution or use. Stocks should be stored in an out of
the way area and in accordance with storage instructions
on the products' labeling until EPA issues a final order after
the cancellation proceedings.
