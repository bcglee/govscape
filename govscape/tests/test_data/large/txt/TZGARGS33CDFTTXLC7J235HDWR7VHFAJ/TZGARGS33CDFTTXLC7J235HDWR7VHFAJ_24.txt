WHAT DOES SUSPENSION MEAN?
Under the Federal Pesticide Law, the Federal
Insecticide; Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)0, pesti-
cides may be registered by EPA when evidence presented by
the manufacturer shows that they may be used without posing
"unreasonable adverse effects" to' humans or the environment.
In order, to. apply the "unreasonable adverse effects" standard
the EPA Administrator must balance the risks posed by a
pesticide against its economic and social benefits. Regis-
tration is granted if the benefits outweigh the risks.
The law places the burden for showing that the pesticide
does not pose unreasonable risks on the proponents of use1,
who typically submit experimental information they develop
to the government as a basis for evaluating any risks the
pesticide may pose..
There are times when; because of advances â€¢ in- science
or when new information becomes avail abl e1,. questions arise
about whether a registration should remain in effect.
There are several procedures EPA can follow in such1
situations:
1) Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration ("RPAR")
The RPAR process begins with a notice summarizing
evidence of potential unreasonable adverse effects and
inviting public comment on the risks and benefits of the
pesticide in question. The RPAR process is characterized
by its informal (i.e.; non-adjudieatory) nature. Its purpose
is to gather information and stimulate broad public debate
about whether the seriousness of problems with a pestici.de
indicated by "validated tests or other significant evidence"
warrants regulatory action. Manufacture and use may continue
during the process. RPAR leads to a decision to take no
action; restrict some or all uses of the pesticide1; or
initiate cancellation.
