I want to reemphasize four points about today's
action:
o a^ preponderance of animal test results in
several species show adverse reproductive
effects! at low levels of exposure;
o there is a remarkably high miscarriage
rate in June in the Alsea study not seen in
:•:}<;.•••;;•; .^the- ooixtroi ..area; . . ..
'.JCD.- in:the June peak follows by 2-3 months the
-; .spraying of 2,4,5-T in the Alsea area; and
OM(I !a:n resitimated A million people are at risk
i ••;••, ;,.,:.dn-'the, spray season about to begin.
Taken together, these facts sound an alarm. They
coitlpel-EPAr.to act to stop use until we have a fuller under-
standing- 'of this phenomenon and its implication for human
health.' A<-.V., • :'•:.<!.•••.••,
We are also taking emergency suspension action against
related'uses' of /Silvex, another herbicide contaminated by
TCDD, .to:preclude similar exposure. Silvex is used primarily
for weed control >on suburban lawns and other turf uses, and
it could be used as a substitute for 2,4,5-T on forests,
rights-of-way,'and pastures.
This emergency suspension action is analogous to a
temporary restraining order issued by a court. We are not
saying that the health effects in humans are positively
proven, or that 2,4,5-T should never be used again. What
