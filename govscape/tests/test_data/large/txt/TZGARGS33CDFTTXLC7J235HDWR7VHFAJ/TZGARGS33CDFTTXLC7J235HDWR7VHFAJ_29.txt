"The emergency suspension action we are taking will
protect the nearly 4 million people who may be unknowingly
and involuntarily exposed as a result of the forestry1,
rights-of-way, and pasture uses," Blum said. "The potential
for significant human exposure, the warning signals from the
Alsea study, the strong animal test data, and the low short
term economic benefits compel this unusual action."
The new study was initiated by EPA because of complaints
from women in Alsea reporting that they had experienced
miscarriages right after the forest area was sprayed with
2,4,5-T. The study was performed by scientists from the
Environmental Health Institute of Colorado State University
and the University of Miami Medical School, Department of
Public Health and Epidemiology. It compared miscarriages over
a 6 year period in the Alsea basin area of western Oregon
with a control area in the eastern part of the State. The
conclusions were:
The miscarriage rate in the Alsea
area was significantly higher than that in
a control area in eastern Oregon where no
2,4,5-T is typically sprayed;
The number of miscarriages peak dramatically
for the 6 years, and particularly for the
last 3 years, in the Alsea area for the month
of June. Forest spraying occurs annually in
March and April;
there is a statistically significant relationship
between the spray season and the high miscarriage
peak which follows application of 2,4,5-T
by 2-3 months.
"It's a remarkable correlation," said Blum. "While
it is not proof of a cause and effect relationship, it is
highly suggestive, particularly in light of animal data, and
gives great cause for concern."
