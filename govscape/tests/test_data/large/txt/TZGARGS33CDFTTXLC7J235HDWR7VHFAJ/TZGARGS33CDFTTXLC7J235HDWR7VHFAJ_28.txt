FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, THURSDAY MARCH 1, 1979
EPA TAKES EMERGENCY Acting on significant new evidence linking
ACTION TO HALT
HERBICIDE the herbicide 2,4,5-T with miscarriages in
SPRAYING
women in Oregon1, the Environmental Protection
Agency today halted major uses of the herbicide
until a full review of its impact on human
health and its benefits is completed.
The Agency's "emergency suspension" action -- the most drastic
measure EPA can take under the law -- was needed because
the spring spray season is only a matter of weeks away.
"Stirdies completed only days ago show a high miscarriage
rate immediately following the spraying of 2,4,5-T in the
forests around Alsqa, Oregon;" said EPA Deputy Administrator
Barbara Blum. "This alarming correlation comes at a time
when 7 million pounds of 2,4,5^T are about to be used
to control weeds on power 1ine rights-of-way and in pastures',
and to manage forest lands across the Nation."
Those uses will be halted .-.immediately by EPA's order.
The remaining legal uses.of 2,4,5-T o/i rangeland and rice
may continue until the final decision because they appear at
this time not to involve human exposure comparable to the
suspended uses.
