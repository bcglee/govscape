the short-term economic impact of this action — i.e.,
suspension of uses over the period of the expedited hearing
and the cancellation proceedings — should not be serious.
This is so because alternatives are available for
pasture and rights-of-way uses, and because only a
tiny fraction of commercial forest acres are treated
in any given year. Moreover, in many cases treatment
of forests, rights-of-way, and pastures can be deferred
until these proceedings are completed. The long-term
economic impacts will be fully evaluated — along with
the long-term health risks — in the cancellation proceedings.
Thank you. I will be happy to answer your
questions.
