Manufacturers of the herbicides; including Dow
Chemical Co., Rhodia', Inc., Thompson Hayward Chemical
Co. and Vertac1, Inc.; have 5 days to appeal EPA's emergency
suspension order. If it is appealed a special expedited
hearing will be convened to consider the Administrator's
finding that an imminent hazard exists. The hearings
will be run by a special panel, which must reach findings
and make a recommendation to the Administrator within
10 days after evidence has been heard. The Administrator
would then have 7 days to issue a final order on whether
the suspension should continue through the cancellation
process.
After the suspension issue is decided; the cancellation
hearing process will begin to consider the larger issue of the
risks and benefits of the herbicide to society over the long
run. Cancellation proceedings usual.ly take between one to two
years to complete.
