2) Cancellation Proceedings
Cancellations begin with a statement of findings
by the Administrator of his reasons for believing that
the risks of a pesticide outweigh its benefits-, and that
its uses should be "cancelled" (i.e.; permanently banned).
The notice receives review by the Secretary of Agriculture
and independent scientific review by a special Panel created
by the law.
Producers and interested parties have 30 days to
request a hearing. If a hearing is requested',the hearing
will fully explore risks and benefits. This is a formal
courtroom-like process before an Administrative Law Judge;
expert witnesses are sworn in and cross examined* Within
25 days after the hearing is over1, the Judge reports his
findings and makes a recommendation to the Administrator.
The Administrator has 90 days after the close of the
hearing to issue a final order. The Final Order may provide
for continuation of some or all uses of the pesticide,
restrictions on its use, or termination of registration11,
whichever the Administrator may conclude is supported by
the record. Any party adversely affected by the final
order may seek review in the Court of Appeals. This may
include persons opposed to use of the pesticide', if the
Order continues registration, as well as proponents of use
if cancellation is ordered.
Cancellation hearings have typically taken 2 years
or more to complete. The pesticide in question may
continue to be marketed until and under the terms of the
final order issued by the Administrator.
3) Suspension Proceedings
Suspension proceedings begin with a finding by the
Administrator that an "imminent hazard" is posed by a
pesticide. An imminent hazard is a situation where the
risks from use of a pesticide during the time required to
complete cancellation proceedings outweigh the benefits
that may be be derived from such use.
