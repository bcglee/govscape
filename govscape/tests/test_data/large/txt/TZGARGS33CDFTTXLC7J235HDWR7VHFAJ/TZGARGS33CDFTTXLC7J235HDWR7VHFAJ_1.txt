EMERGENCY ACTION TO STOP SPRAYING OF THE
HERBICIDES 2,4,5-T AND SILVEX
PRESS CONFERENCE STATEMENT
BY EPA DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR

WASHINGTON, D. C.
Good afternoon. We are taking emergency action today
to halt the spring spraying of the herbicide 2,4,5-T on the
basis of new information indicating its potential link to
human miscarriages.
As many of you know, 2,4,5-T has been under intensive
review by EPA for over a year due primarily to adverse
health effects shown in test animals because of a contaminant
known as TCDD or tetra-dioxin. This dioxin, even at very low
levels, causes severe reproductive effects — miscarriages and
birth defects — and tumors in laboratory animals.
We have just received the results of a study which
shows a high probability that the herbicide is linked to
actual human miscarriages in an area where 2,4,5-T is used
regularly.
New studies in the Alsea basin area of Oregon, show a
high miscarriage rate shortly after the spraying of 2,4,5-T
in the forests. This alarming correlation comes at a time
when 7 million pounds of 2,4,5-T are about to be used across
the Nation to control weeds on power line rights-of-way, to
manage forest lands, and to control weeds in pastures.
