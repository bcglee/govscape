The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts of eradication treatments of small isolated populations
like the ones in the eradication zone. Due to the nature of the dispenser and the pheromone itself, there
will be no impacts to human health and limited, if any, impacts to nontarget species because the
product is contained in dispensers that are tied to fixtures and will be removed after treatment. The
pheromone itself has been shown to attract several native tortricids as well as a pyralid based on trap
catches that are baited with LBAM pheromone. However, each of these species has a widespread
distribution and therefore any impact to these non-targets will be minimal and localized. In addition,
there will be no negative cumulative effects from this action in combination with any other actions
because the treatments in isolated population areas will not be combined with other LBAM eradication
tools.
APHIS conducted an online query of the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office’s species lists available
at http://www.fws.gov/sacramento/es/spp_lists /auto_list_form.cfm. APHIS has reviewed the
eradication boundary and the potential for co-occurrence of listed species and critical habitat. Based
on our review of the eradication zone we have determined there is potential for the treatment areas to
co-occur within the range of several listed species and critical habitat; we are consulting further with
the FWS to determine if any protection measures are necessary. In addition, APHIS has consulted the
National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the co-occurrence of the Central California Coast
steelhead and received confirmation that the deployment of twist ties will not affect the species or its
habitat. Once consultation is completed with the FWS, if deemed necessary, APHIS will incorporate
any necessary protection measures to ensure the deployment of twist ties will not adversely affect
listed species or their designated critical habitat.
APHIS’ finding of no significant impact for the treatments within the eradication boundary is based
upon the expected limited environmental consequences, as analyzed in the EA. An environmental
impact statement (EIS) must be prepared if implementation of the proposed action may significantly
affect the quality of the human environment. I have determined that there would be no significant
impact to the human environment from the implementation of the treatment alternative and, therefore,
no EIS needs to be prepared.
