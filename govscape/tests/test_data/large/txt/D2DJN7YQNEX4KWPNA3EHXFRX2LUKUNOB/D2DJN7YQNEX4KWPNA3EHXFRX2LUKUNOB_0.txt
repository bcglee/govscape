Finding of No Significant Impact
Eradication of Isolated Populations of Light Brown Apple Moth in California
Revised Environmental Assessment
June, 2007
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),
has prepared a revised environmental assessment (EA) that analyzes potential environmental
consequences of eradicating isolated populations of light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana)
(LBAM) in California. The EA, incorporated by reference in this document, is available online at
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/ea/downloads/lbam-ea-07-18-07.pdf and from:

The revised EA analyzed alternatives consisting of (1) maintaining the Federal quarantine order
without further action by APHIS (no action alternative), and (2) continuation of the Federal quarantine
order along with eradication of isolated populations of LBAM in California with the use of Bacillus
thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) and/or LBAM-specific pheromone (treatment alternative). The revised
EA evaluated the potential impacts from eradication treatments of small, isolated populations and
determined that any potential impacts would be limited. Since the circumstances surrounding each
isolated population are unique, each site will be considered in a finding of no significant impact
(FONSI) prior to treatment. This FONSI addresses the treatment for LBAM in the southern part of
Sonoma and Napa Counties in California (see attachment 1).
Treatment in the Sonoma and Napa Eradication Area
Nine male LBAMs have been trapped over the past few months in the southern portion of Sonoma and
Napa counties. This area consists of mostly agricultural plots with very few residents. An eradication
zone has been defined around these finds (see attachment 1). This FONSI addresses not only treatment
for the nine finds but also any additional finds within the eradication boundary. Maps for future
treatment sites within this potential treatment area will be posted online at
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/ea/lbam.shtml
When an LBAM is found within this eradication boundary, a 200-meter radius area will be defined as a
treatment area for each find. The treatment areas will be treated with Isomate-LBAM plus
(pheromone-impregnated twist ties) at a rate of 250 dispensers per acre by attaching the twist ties to
trees, shrubs, and other fixtures. The twist ties allow for the continual release of pheromone over the
course of 120 days. The twist ties will be removed after two LBAM life cycles (a lifecycle could be up
to six months in certain areas). In some cases the twist ties may be replaced for additional treatments.
When all treatments are completed, the twist ties will be removed.
