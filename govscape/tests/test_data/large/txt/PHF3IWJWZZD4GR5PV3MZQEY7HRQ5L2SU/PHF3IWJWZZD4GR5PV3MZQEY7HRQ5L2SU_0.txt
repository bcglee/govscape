BASIC SEED DATA SUPPORTING NRCS VEGETATIVE GUIDES
The data presented in this Technical Note was used to prepare the new Vegetative Guide seeding
rates in pounds of pure live seed (PLS) per acre. Seeding rates for conservation practices used in
California that utilize vegetative plantings are listed in the Vegetative Guides for each of the 16
Major Land Resource Areas. Vegetative Guides needed by an NRCS Field Office can be found
in Section II of the Field Office Technical Guide. All of the planting alternatives presented to
clients should be based on rates obtained from the Vegetative Guides in the Field Office
Technical Guide. In some cases, the rates may differ slightly due to the nature of the job but
these should be discussed first with the appropriate discipline specialist or plant materials
specialist.
Table 1 provides the best available information on the number of seeds per pound for California
native grasses, native forbs and shrubs, other grasses and cereals, legumes, and other forbs and
shrubs. The first scientific name is based on the 1993 edition of The Jepson Manual (cid:150) Higher
Plants of California. The indented scientific name represents the previous common or historical
usage. Data was primarily obtained from the Journal of Seed Technology, Volume 6 Number 2
titled "Rules for Testing Seeds" published by the Association of Official Seed Analysts in 1986;
Part 201 of the Federal Seed Act Regulation (cid:150) (cid:147)Seed Testing Regulations(cid:148) published by the
USDA Agricultural Marketing Service; USDA Agricultural Handbook 339 - Grasses and
Legumes for Soil Conservation in the Pacific Northwest and Great Basin States; the 1948 USDA
Yearbook of Agriculture-Grass; and from the California Department of Food and Agricultureâ€™s
Seed Laboratory. Other data was obtained from University of California DANR Publication
3338 and USDA-NRCS California Plant Materials Technical Note 40.
Table 2 demonstrates the variability in seed weights from year to year and between seed grown in
different parts of the state. The standard number of seeds per pound represents an average for
that species or cultivar.
Table 3 demonstrates the variability in purity and germination between seed lots for the same
species. The percent germination and the percent of hard seed in legumes in a seed lot varies
from year to year due to climatic factors and storage conditions. The percent hard seed is
discounted when we calculate the amount of pure live seed (PLS). This is why it is necessary to
calculate the PLS based on the seed tag data for each bag of seed and seed lot.
