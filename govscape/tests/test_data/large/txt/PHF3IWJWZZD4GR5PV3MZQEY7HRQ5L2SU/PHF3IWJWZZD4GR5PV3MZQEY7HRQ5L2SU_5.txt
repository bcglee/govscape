1/ Rounded to nearest 10 seeds per pound. Represents number of clean seeds after other crop seeds, weed seeds, and inert
matter have been subtracted. Percent germination and purity data would still be needed to calculate PLS. Number of seeds
per square foot (SF) for one pound of seed applied per acre was calculated by dividing the number of seeds per pound by
43,560 square feet per acre.
2/ Data from Table 2, Plant Materials Technical Note No. 40, or University of California DANR Publication 3338.
* Data from Journal of Seed Analysts.
** A range is given when there is a constant variance in the seeds per pound. In these cases an average seeds per pound is also
provided. Ranges will be in accordance with "Rules For Testing Seeds" published by the Association of Official Seed
Analysts in the Journal of Seed Technology, Volume 6 Number 2, 1986.
