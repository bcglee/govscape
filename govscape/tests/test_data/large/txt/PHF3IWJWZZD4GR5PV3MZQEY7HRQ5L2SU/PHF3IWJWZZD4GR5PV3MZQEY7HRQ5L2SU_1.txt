The number of seeds per square foot that would result from applying one pound of seed per acre
can be calculated by dividing the number of seeds per pound by 43,560 square feet per acre. The
number of seeds per square foot is used to calculate the seeding rates that provide the desired
species composition and plant population.
Seeding rates in the new Vegetative Guides were calculated based on goals that varied from
planting 20 up to 60 pure live seed (PLS) per square foot depending on the practice and seeding
method.
Remember to adjust the seeding rates at the field site to plant the needed pounds of PLS.
Using the percent germination and percent purity data on the seed tag, PLS can be determined by
the formula:
Percent PLS = (percent germination * percent purity) / 100
Adjusted Seeding Rate = ( 100 / percent PLS in the seed bag/lot ) * specified lbs. of PLS/acre
EXAMPLE: If the specified seeding rate is 10 lbs. PLS/acre and the seed tag shows:
Purity: 95 percent
Germination: 79 percent (do not include the percent hard seed)
Therefore: PLS content of seed bag = 7505/100 = 75 percent
Adjusted Seeding Rate is: (Round to nearest lb./acre)
(100/75) * 10 lbs./acre = 1.333 * 10 = 13.33 lbs./acre USE 13 lbs./acre
Seeds per Foot of Drill Row
When a seed drill will be used, testing and calibration are needed to insure that the specified
seeding rate is being applied. The required number of seeds per foot of drill row can be
calculated using the following formula:
Seeds/ft. of Row = (Adjusted Seeding Rate in lbs./acre * Number of Seeds/lb.) / RF
RF = Row Factor - which represents the total feet of rows/acre
RF = 87,120 for 6 inch row spacing
= 74,488 for 7 inch row spacing
= 65,340 for 8 inch row spacing
= 57,935 for 9 inch row spacing
= 52,272 for 10 inch row spacing
