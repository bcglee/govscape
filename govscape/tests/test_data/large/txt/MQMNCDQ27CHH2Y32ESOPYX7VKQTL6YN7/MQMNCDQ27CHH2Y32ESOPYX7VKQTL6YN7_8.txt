INTRODUCTION
Between June and August 1974. a survey was made of the trees growing
on a 1 square mile instrumented test grid in the center of Test Area C-52A
(TA C-52A), liglin Air Force Base Reservation, Florida. This test area
received massive quantities of military herbicides during the period
1962 to 1970 while aerial dissemination equipment was being tested. Prior
to this period, the area had been bulldozed and cleared of vegetation in
order to make it a useful test range. It has also been burned several
times by controlled burning and by wild fire.
The objective of the survey was to provide baseline data for studying
the ecological recovery and reforestation of an area subjected to land
clearing operations, mowing, and extensive herbicide applications.
