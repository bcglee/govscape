SUCTION V
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The 1 square mile instrumented test grid of Test Area C-52A has pre-
viously received massive and repeated applications of military herbicide
and has been subjected to land clearing operations. These operations
resulted in the destruction of trees and much of the other vegetation
on the instrumented grid and parts of the adjacent areas. There have
been no recent requirements for land clearing operations, and chemical
analyses and bioassays have revealed that the active herbicide ingre-
dients have disappeared.
The area appeared to be in a normal stage of vegetative succession.
The ecological recovery was obviously being retarded by a lack of soil
moisture and by the constant movement of soil by the wind. Both of these
factors were probably induced by the previous repeated destruction of
vegetative ground cover and trees.
Grasses had started to infiltrate even the most arid sections of the
test grid. This, together with the reappearance of small trees in certain
parts of the area, should accelerate the recovery.
In contrast to the surrounding pine forest, the trees of the cleared
area were principally oaks. The vast majority of these probably sprouted
from roots that, survived the various stresses rather than from seeds
brought into the area. In the southern sections, which received the
most herbicide, it appeared that even the roots of the trees were
destroyed. Trees in these sections were sparse even in the more moist
areas and apparently originated from seeds.
The results of this study indicate that the lack of trees on parts
of the test grid is directly related to previous herbicide applications
and that succession is generally niorc rapid in the more moist areas.
Additional surveys should bo nude in future years to study the
pattern of succession in this unique test area. Appendix A contains
data collected in this survey, which can be used for comparison in
future studies on the vegetative succession of TA C-52A.
