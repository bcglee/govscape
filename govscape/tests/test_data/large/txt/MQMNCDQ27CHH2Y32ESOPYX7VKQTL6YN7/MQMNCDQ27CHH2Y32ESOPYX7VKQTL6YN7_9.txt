SECTION II
UI-SCRTl'TION OP TA C-52A
TA C-52A is a man-made, grassy plain that covers approximately 3 square
miles (Figure 1). It is surrounded by a dense forest stand that is dominated
by sand pine (Pinus £jjiusn_ (Cngelm) VasoyJ but that also includes longleaf
pine (P inu s pal us t r i s Mill), turkey oak ('Qucrcus J.aeyijS_ Walt), and live oak
(Qucrcus yijrgirviana Mill) . The instrumented "rid used for herbicide equip-
ment, testing is subdivided into 400-by 400-foot sections by permanent markers
(Figure 2). This grid is occupied mainly by broomsedgc (And r op o go n v i r g i n icus
L.)i switcligrass (Panicurn virgatum L.), and low growing grasses and" herbs.
The soils of the test grid arc predominantly well drained, acid sands
of the Lakeland association and include Lakeland, Chipley, and Rutlcdgc sand
series (Figure 3). A small shallow pond is located just south of marker F-7
and an intermittent pond is located northeast of marker G-13. The average
annual rainfall on the area is approximately 60 inches, and the average
temperature is approximately 65°F.
Herbicide spray, aircraft flightpaths, and herbicide quantities are
shown in Figure 4. There was no way to determine the exact quantity of
herbicide deposited on each of the sample plots. Deposition levels would
vary considerably, depending on existing meteorological and flight conditions,
as well as on herbicide discharge rate. Figure 4 shows the quantity of herbi-
cide delivered on the instrumented grid and the quantity deposited on a non-
instrumented grid (Grid 1) immediately south of the surveyed area. Grid 1
received nearly 1,000 pounds of herbicide per acre between 1962 and 1964,
and undoubtedly, some fallout occurred on the test, plots of the 1 square mile
gr id.
Young (Reference 1) lias provided a thorough description of the area
including vegetation, animal life, climatology and soils, us well as the
history of the use of the test area and herbicide deposition levels.
