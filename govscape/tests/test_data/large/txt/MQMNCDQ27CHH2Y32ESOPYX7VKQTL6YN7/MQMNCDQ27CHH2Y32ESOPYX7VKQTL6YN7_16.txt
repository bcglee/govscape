SUCTION IV
ROSUI.TS AND DISCUSSION
A total of 5,155 trees was counted in the 845 sample plots on the
1 square mile grid of TA C-52A, representing an average of 126.9 trees
per acre. The average could be misleading, however, because 66 per cent
of the sample plots contained no trees. 1'igurc 8 shows the distribution
of trees.
The species present were dispersed in patterns over the grid due to
largely unknown reasons, and the dominant species in one area might be
scarce in another area. However, over the entire grid, the dominant
species were live oak (Qucrcus yjj^ipiajw Mill) and turkey oak (Qucrcus
lacvis Walt). Five other species of oaks (Qucrcus spp), three species
of pines (Pinus spp), and the common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana L.)
were also found in the sample plots. The number and heights of these
trees are shown in Table 1. Although not observed in any of the plots,
one cedar (Junipcrus silicicola (Small) Bailey) was observed on the grid.
The combined effects of land clearing, fire, and herbicide application
on the survey area were quite pronounced. The denudation of the area
resulted in scquelai, such as loss of soil moisture and blowing sand,
that continued to retard ecological recovery (Figure 6). A large part
of the area had not recovered sufficiently to permit natural reforestation,
particularly in the southern one-third and in parts of the northeast corner
of the 1 square mile grid. These areas were quite arid and sandy but did
contain a few widely scattered small trees even in sections where no trees
were observed in the sample plots.
The mean height for the 5,155 trees counted was less than 2 feet. Only
41 of these had a height over 6 feet (I'igurc 7), the tallest being 11 feet.
Most of the trees were oaks found in small but dense clusters originating
from the roots of previous trees. Trees starting from seeds, such as pines,
persimmons, and single oaks, were relatively sparse, but their presence
indicated the area was recovering.
Although the data were not statistically analyzed due to lack of precise
information on actual herbicide deposition, there docs appear to be some
correlation between previous spray aircraft fIIghtpaths and plots with no
trees. There also appears to be some correlation between the presence oF
trees and the more moist Chiplcy ard Rut ledge sands, ns well as the proximity
to the two major clay roads which cross the grid.
