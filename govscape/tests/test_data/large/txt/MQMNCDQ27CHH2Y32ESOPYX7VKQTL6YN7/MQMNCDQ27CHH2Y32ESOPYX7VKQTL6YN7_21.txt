Photographs of typical areas on the grid arc shown in Figures 9 to 12
and of the surrounding cleared areas are shown in Figures 13 to 16. As
can he seen, young trees were well developed in the adjacent clearing on
all sides except to the south where massive herbicide applications were
made between 1962 and 1961. This area, called Grid 1, consisted of a
2,000-by 2,000-foot test area centered approximately 1,000 feet south
of marker N-7. Although not a part of the current study, Grid 1 was
surveyed on foot and only 6 trees were observed. Four of the trees
were sand pines and the other two were longleaf pines.
The dominance of small oaks on the 1 square mile grid contrasted
markedly with the clear dominance of sand pine around the border of the
clearing. Oaks also predominated in most: of the cleared area surrounding
the 1 square mile grid, except to the south (on and around Grid 1), where
there were only a few small pines. This lack of trees on Grid 1 appeared
to be more related to the previous heavy herbicide deposition than to
lack of soil moisture, except for the area adjacent to the 1 square mile
grid, which was extremely arid and sandy.
Agcrton and Crews (Reference 2) have shown that the residual herbicide
has, for all practical purposes, disappeared. They were able to grow sensi-
tive agronomic crops in the most arid section 300 feet south of marker
0-7. These crops required considerable extra water and were not as
healthy as controls, but showed no herbicide damage.
In general, it appears that land clearing and herbicide application
killed the trees in the clearing and also some of the oaks along the tree
line. With the disappearance of the active ingredients of the herbicides
and cessation of land clearing operations, trees are reappearing, hut
mainly from the roots of previous trees. Natural rcseeding has been slow
due to the distances from other mature trees and the lack of soil moisture
necessary for seed germination. Strong winds in this large open area
contribute to the drying of the soil and probably keep most small seeds
from settling in the barren areas.
