SUCTION LET
SURVEY MliTIlOHS
The tree survey was made by sampling each of the 169 sections (400 by
K)0 feet) of the test grid. Five sample plots were taken at predetermined
locations in each of the sections. These plots (SO by 50 feet.) were located
50 feet diagonally from the permanent markers at each corner of the section
and at the center of the section. When the intended sample area was inter-
rupted by a road, the plots were shifted 50 feet in the direction shown by
the arrows i.n Figure 5. Within each plot, the species and height (to the
nearest foot) of each tree were recorded (Appendix A). Oaks (Qucrcus spp)
were frequently found growing in dense clusters. In such cases, all shoots
emerging from the ground that were over 6 inches in height were counted as
separate trees.
