ROSE, WOOD’S, Rosa woodsii:
An erect medium shrub from 1-2 m (3-7 ft) tall; stems are stout, strongly armed to unarmed
(prickles); leaves are alternate, deciduous, odd-pinnately compound with 5-7 leaflets, coarsely
toothed; flowers are small, pink, in terminal clusters on current years growth; fruit are red-hips
from globose to elliptical or pear-shaped. Habitat, occurring as individuals or thickets on open
slopes, roadsides and river and stream bottoms at low to mid elevations. Preferred soils vary from
silt loam to sandy loam, are well drained and nonsaline. It is intolerant of poor drainage, high
watertable and prolonged flooding. Fruit ripens from late summer through fall and is processed by
maceration followed by the floating off of pulp and empty seed with water. Seed is stored dry in
sealed containers at 1 to 3(cid:176) C (34 to 37(cid:176) F). Propagation by seed is either with fresh seed (without
pretreatment) in the fall or pretreated seed in the spring. Pretreatment includes a warm
stratification period of 60 to 90 days at 18 to 24(cid:176) C (65 to 75(cid:176) F) followed by prechilling for 90 to
120 days at 1 to 4(cid:176) C (34 to 40(cid:176) F). Cover seed with a shallow layer of soil approximately 0.5 to 2.0
cm (0.2 to 0.8 inch) in depth. Percent rooting of softwood and hardwood cuttings is low. . Field
propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is rarely successful. Root cuttings have bee
successfully used to establish Wood’s rose in moist environments.
SUMAC, SKUNKBUSH - Rhus trilobata:
A small to medium much branched dense shrub 1-3 m (3-10 ft) tall; stems are numerous, slender
and much branched; leaves are alternate, green above and pale below, finely hairy when young, ill-
scented when crushed, divided into 3 leaflets, middle leaflet is spatula-shaped with a wedge base
and mostly three-lobed and coarsely toothed, the side leaflets are egg-shaped and mostly three-
lobed and broadly toothed; flowers are in short dense clusters, yellow; fruit is a small globe-shaped
berry, red, sticky hairy and numerous in short dense clusters. Habitat includes rocky hillsides,
canyon bottoms, rocky riparian areas, stabilized blow sands and well-drained shorelines. These
sites are typically excessively drained with low waterholding capabilities. Propagation can be
performed with seed and by cuttings. Seed dormancy is caused by a hard seed coat and some
embryo dormancy. It requires scarification with sandpaper, acid or warm water, and prechilling at
20 to 30(cid:176) C for 30 to 60 days. . Greenhouse asexual propagation - The recommended propagation
for hardwood cuttings is under greenhouse conditions. Field propagation by dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings is rarely successful.
WILLOWS - Salix spp.:
Most willows can be propagated either from seed or dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings. Seed is
very small which means a restricted food store that limits the viability of the embryo and dictates a
short life span. Seeds have a viability range of one day to about two weeks. The seedbed must be
fresh and fertile.
BEBB WILLOW - S. bebbiana:
Shrub-type; A shrub to small tree, 4-9 m (13-30 ft), with stems between 1-2 dm (4-8 in) thick. It
has short brown slightly reddish branches that have long hairs that are wavy or curly, tangled, and
either tightly or loosely appressed; leaves are narrow with a glaucous lower surface, entire margins
(usually), and a distinctive shape. The shape is narrow at the bottom, wide about 2/3 up the leaf,
and a point at the top; can be confused with Scouler's willow (see Scouler's Willow). Bebb's
Willow is found from 1010-2410 m (3300-7900 ft) associated with the Douglas fir zone and non-
subalpine mountain big sage habitat. Rarely is it the dominant willow. It is usually found with
quaking aspen, water birch, and black cottonwood. In low elevations, it grows in moist to wet soils
that are heavily organic to silty, sandy or gravelly. While in higher elevations, it is found on dry
