riparian sites, but is rarely found on upland sites. Field propagation by dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings is moderately successful, although it does not have a high establishment rate.
BLACK WILLOW - S. nigra:
Tree-type; A tall tree to 30 m (100 ft) and round-topped; similar in many ways to Peachleaf willow;
trunk is large, up to 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter; older bark is deeply furrowed and dark brown;
branches generally slender and outspreading; younger shoots yellowish and slightly pubescent;
leaves long to 15 cm (6 in), narrow, and light green underneath; venation on the leaf somewhat
pubescent; heart-shaped stipules; found along streams, marshes, swamps, lakes and ponds; native
to the east and escaped or planted in the west. Generally found on the upper bank or floodplain; do
not plant in the channel or bank-full width. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings is very successful. Large diameter dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings can readily be
taken and used for revegetation projects. Cuttings with deeply furrowed bark have a lower
establishment rate than younger smooth barked hardwood cuttings. Deeply furrowed bark
hardwood cuttings should be wounded before planting to stimulate rooting up and down the stem.
BOOTH WILLOW - S. boothii:
Shrub-type; Most common willow found in the west. Many-branched shrub with rounded top 2-3
m (6-10 ft) tall. Basal stems seldom larger than 5 cm (2 in). New to second year twigs are usually
yellow and occasionally orange or brown. Leaves are the same color on both sides; very little hair
on the back of older leaf; leaf is wider and not as long as Pacific willow. It found in mid-elevation
areas; not found in hot canyon bottoms or cool highlands. It prefers coarse soils, but is found on
deep fine-textured soils; usually associated with Geyer and Drummond willow. Replaced in lower
elevations by Yellow willow. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is very
successful. Cuttings can be planted at the bank-full width to the floodplain because the flexible
branches can withstand high water velocities, ice, and debris loads.
COYOTE WILLOW - S. exigua:
Creeping-type; Commonly referred to as sandbar willow and dusky willow. This complex has been
significantly condensed with new taxonomic methods. Generally, the complex is strongly
suckering producing large thickets of slender stemmed willows. Basically, there are two
subspecies are now recognized:
Salix exigua ssp. exigua
Shrub up to 8 m (26 ft) tall with narrow gray-green or silvery pubescent leaves that are
entire with short petioles. Subspecies exigua is found below 1830 m (6000 ft) in the
Wyoming big sagebrush zone on all soil textures. It prefers disturbed areas on stream edges
and moist well-drained benches and bottomlands. Most often found with Pacific and yellow
willow, redosier dogwood, current species, black cottonwood, and water birch.
Salix exigua ssp. melanopsis
Shrubs up to 4 m (13 ft) tall with narrow toothed leaves that are glaucous below. Typically
found on stream edges. Range is above subspecies exigua and below 2130 m (7000 ft).
Generally found in open riparian corridors within forested areas and in Mountain big
sagebrush dominated valleys below the treeline. Prefers sandy to gravelly soils and bars in
the channel. Most often found with Drummond and Booth willow.
One variety is recognized because of its floral similarities to Salix exigua ssp. exigua and
vegetative similarities to Salix exigua ssp. melanopsis. This variety is Salix exigua ssp. melanopsis
