groundwater. It is most often grown by unrooted or rooted cuttings, but can also be grown from
seed. Seed is collected in August and September; use a macerator to depulp, float off residue; store
air dried seeds in sealed containers at 3 to 5(cid:176) C (37 to 41(cid:176) F) for two to four years; propagation
requires cold stratification for 60 to 90 days at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F); seed coat scarification may improve
germination; fall sowing is recommended; another recommendation is to prechill the seed for 28
days at 20 to 30(cid:176) C, warm stratify for few days and rechill for 120-160 days prior to planting.
Greenhouse asexual propagation by stem cuttings is easy and can be done either as actively
growing soft or greenwood cuttings treated with 1,000 ppm IBA, under mist, or as dormant,
hardwood cuttings treated with 3,000 to 5,000 ppm IBA, and placed under mist. Use a 1:1,
perlite:vermiculite or high percent sand media. Actively growing cuttings should be at least 5 to 8
cm (2 to 3 in) in length and hardwood cuttings 8 to 16 cm (3 to 6 in). Field propagation by
dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is moderately successful. Dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings should be wounded through bark in multiple locations to enhance rooting and
establishment. Plant in moist, well aerated soil. Redosier dogwood can also be propagated by
layering. Layer existing stems by pulling branches to the ground and covering with soil, this will
result in rooted material that can later be cut/dug and transplanted.
ELDERBERRY, BLUE - Sambucus cerulea:
A medium to large shrub with a broad crown and straight trunk from 2-4 m (6-13 ft) tall; bark is
thick, irregularly ridged/furrowed, sometimes scaly, dark brown to reddish-brown; branches are
stout, spreading, green and hairy when young becoming light brown and smooth with age, with
triangular leaf scars and a thick white pith; leaves are opposite, deciduous, pinnate compound
composed of 5-9 leaflets which are broadest at middle, rounded at base, pointed at tip and coarsely
toothed along edge; flowers produced in broad, spreading, flat-topped yellowish-white clusters;
fruit berries, dark blue to black and covered with a wax-like coating making berries appear pale
blue, with 3-5 seeds per berry. Habitat is along banks, washes of streams, fence rows, rocky
pastures and other drier riparian locations on well drained moist soils at mid elevations. Collect
fruit in August and September, fresh fruit can be processed through a macerator and the pulp and
empty seed floated off with water, or the fruit may be dried, rubbed down, and the seed applied
directly in this form; processed seed can be stored for several years at 5(cid:176) C; Recommendations for
sexual propagation include storing dry seed at room temperature for 450 days, followed by cold
stratification at 1(cid:176) C (34(cid:176) F) for 90 to 100 days prior to sowing, spring sowing recommendations
include 3 days of presoaking, followed by stratification in vermiculite for 90 days at 5(cid:176) C, sow to a
depth of 0.6 cm (0.25 in) and cover with a thin layer of sawdust, use mulch on fall-sown seed; other
recommendations include direct fall sowing soon after collection, or warm stratification for 10
weeks followed by prechilling for 12 weeks at 20 to 30(cid:176) C and sown in spring. Greenhouse
asexual propagation can be by either hardwood stem cuttings that include two-year-wood heel or
softwood cuttings taken in June to July. The softwood cuttings are placed in vermiculite under
mist with 60% shade for several weeks and will root approximately 30% of cuttings. Young
seedlings can be transplanted at 1-2 years of age. Field propagation by dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings is somewhat successful. Cuttings taken from the previous seasonâ€™s growth
during the winter are best. Always take with a heel to prevent exposure of the pith.
ELDERBERRY, RED - Sambucus racemosa spp. pubens:
A small to medium shrub 1-3 m (3-10 ft) tall very similar to blue elderberry except as noted; leaves
are opposite, deciduous, pinnate compound composed of 5-7 leaflets which are broadest at middle,
rounded at base, pointed at tip, sharply toothed along edge and hairy below; flowers produced in
broad, spreading, rounded yellowish-white clusters; fruit berries, red to purple-black and with 3-5
seeds per berry. Habitat is along protected banks, washes of streams, fence rows, rocky pastures
