SCOULER WILLOW - S. scouleriana:
Upland Shrub-type; Large shrub to tree commonly 6-10 m (20-33 ft) and up to 15m (50 ft) tall. It is
highly variable. New stems have "peach-fuzz" while older stems can be glabrous or with some
"peach-fuzz." New stems are yellow to dark with a tendency to droop. Older stems have a skunky
odor when bark is stripped. Leaves are 2-4 times longer than wide, generally glabrous and green
above, and bottom with red-tinged (distinctive) "peach-fuzz" and later waxy. Margin is wavy-
edged; top is blunt or short-tipped, widest near tip. Found at mid to high elevation, 1000-2400 m
(3300-8000 ft). Likes some moist areas, but generally drier upland sites especially in higher
elevations. Associated with quaking aspen, black cottonwood, thinleaf alder, Bebb, yellow, coyote,
Pacific, Booth, and Geyer willows. This willow is not usually planted in riparian channels. Field
propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is usually difficult.
SITKA WILLOW - S. sitchensis:
Shrub-type; Small tree or shrub 1-8 m (3-25 ft) tall. Branches are dark brown to gray and sparsely
hairy. Twigs are densely velvety and brittle at the base. The leaves are alternate, deciduous, broad
and tapering from above the middle to the base. They are 4-9 cm (2-3.5 in) long with the upper side
bright green and sparsely silky and the lower side is satiny with short hairs pressed flat. The
margins are smooth or with tiny glandular teeth. The leaf stalks are yellowish, velvety and 5-15 cm
(2-6 in) long. Stipules are half-oval and they fall off early in the season on slow growing twigs or
they are retained throughout the season. Sitka willow is common along streams and rivers in
thickets, lakeshores and wetland margins, forest edges and wet openings, and clearings. It can be
found in low to mid elevations. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is
fairly easy.
WHITE WILLOW - S. alba:
Tree-type; medium to large tree, 12-22 m (40-65 ft) tall, with low hanging branches that form a
broad spreading round crown. Twigs are nearly hairless to silky. Leaves are 5-15 cm (2-6 in) long
and 1-3.5 cm (.35-1.25 in) wide, long-pointed, v-based, and fine toothed. Leaves are gray-green
above and whitened with silky-haired beneath. Glands are present at the leaf bases and stipules are
lacking. White willow is prone to insect attacks. The most common white willow on the market is a
selection called the golden willow. Plant out of the bankfull width on the upper channel areas and
floodplain. It can be found at low to mid elevations. Field propagation success by dormant
unrooted hardwood cuttings is moderate to good.
YELLOW WILLOW - S. lutea:
Shrub-type; Rounded shrub 3-6 m (1-3 ft), sometimes to 8 m (3 ft) tall. It will occasionally become
a multistemed tree with stems up to 20 cm (8 in) thick. Twigs are glabrous and generally yellowish-
white to gray to robin-egg blue. Leaf is green above and pale, glaucous below. Leaf margins are
fine toothed to inconspicuously toothed to entire. Stipules are small and inconspicuous or larger on
vigorous shoots that are eventually deciduous. Yellow willow is commonly found at elevations
between 610-1372 m (2000-4500 ft). It is rarely found as a single species. Often found with coyote
willow or pacific willow. It grows on a wide variety of soils from coarse cobble along streams to
moist terraces with deep, fine textured soils. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings is very successful.
NOTE: MANY OF THESE SPECIES ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AS POTTED OR BARE
ROOT STOCK AND MAY BE PURCHASED FOR TRANSPLANT.
