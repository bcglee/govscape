var. tenerrima. It is a shrub up to 5-m (17 ft) with extremely narrow leaves that are green, glabrous,
and nonglaucous.
Field propagation - Coyote willow is easily propagated from dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings. The largest diameter cutting possible will give the best establishment results. Cuttings can
be planted below the bank-full width to reduce the velocity of the runoff water, thereby reducing
the sediment load. Its flexible stems will bend down with the high water velocities, ice or debris
flows, but they will return quickly to the upright position when the water has receded, or the ice
melts or the debris moves off. One of the best willows for bioengineering and streambank
stabilization projects.
DRUMMOND WILLOW - S. drummondiana:
Shrub-type; A shrub that grows 2-4 m (6-14 ft) tall; new stems have a glaucous (white waxy)
covering with a red color (sometimes purple to green) underneath; leaves narrow at the base,
widening out at the upper middle, and rounding off at the top; leaves are dark on top with a silver-
velvety pubescence underneath that appears to be glaucous, but won’t rub off; Common from lower
edge of the forest zone up to the middle of the subalpine zone; more abundant in the higher
elevation stream corridor areas dominated by Englemann spruce or subalpine fir; it grows on moist,
well-aerated soils; associated with current, honeysuckle, and groundsel species. Field propagation
by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is very successful. Small to medium shrub with flexible
stems that can be planted from low to mid-slope to floodplain. Multiple stems will intercept
streamflow and slow velocities down and then return to upright position after the water, ice, or
debris has gone down.
GEYER WILLOW - S. geyeriana:
Shrub-type; A shrub up to 6 m (20 ft) tall; stems are numerous, straight, and slender; new stems are
green with a heavy white glaucous coating (heaviest coating on new growth from the basal cluster);
leaves dark and hairy above with hair and white powder on the underside that will rub off with the
thumb; commonly found between 1220-2440 m (4000 - 8000 ft); absent from low elevation
riparian zones and subalpine zones; concentrated in the upper part of the Wyoming big sage zone to
the upper Douglas fir zone; typically found in the drier parts of the riparian zone (benches back
from the stream) and side branches of the stream system; likes deep, fine-textured soils with a
overstory of thinleaf alder, water birch, and lodgepole pine; often considered to grow as tall as the
soil is deep; will grow on clayey soils better than Drummond willow; associated with Booth willow
which will grow in the wetter areas of the riparian corridor while Geyer’s grows in the drier areas;
very close taxonomically to Lemmon willow and they may be synonymous. Field propagation by
dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is highly successful.
LEMMON WILLOW - S. lemmonii:
Shrub-type; Small to medium shrub about 1-3 m (3-10 ft); stems are dark (almost black), crooked,
and numerous; new stems are heavily glaucous, especially those arising from the base; leaves green
without hairs above and white below (thinly hairy and glabrous); commonly found at higher
elevations than Geyer willow on dryer portions of the riparian zone, upper part of the Douglas fir
zone to the lower subalpine zone; soils are generally well-drained gravelly or sandy soils; closely
associated with Drummond and Booth willow, and birch species which will generally be found on
wetter areas; Multiple stemmed willow is easily propagated from dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings; Lemmon willow should be planted at upper middle elevations on somewhat drier areas
adjacent to the stream; very close taxonomically to Geyer willow and they may be synonymous.
Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is very successful.
