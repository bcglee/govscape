USERS GUIDE TO
DESCRIPTION, PROPAGATION AND ESTABLISHMENT
OF NATIVE SHRUBS AND TREES
FOR RIPARIAN AREAS
IN THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST
INTRODUCTION
Establishment of riparian plant species depends on proper selection of species, plant material
procurement and handling, planting location, and establishment techniques (Hoag 1993). The
success of a project is dependent on the complete integration of these steps. When planning a
project, it is important to observe the existing vegetation and their respective locations in
relationship to the stream and water table (Figure 1). Attempt to match the potential native woody
species at the project site. Note that not all riparian sites will have woody species (i.e. low gradient
meadow streams). If the project area does not have woody plant species and it should, a reference
site similar to the project site should be located. Attempt to match as close as possible the
hydrology where the different species normally grow when planting the project site. This is the
biological benchmark one is striving to create.
Plants with flexible stems and rhizomatous root systems are usually located from the top of the toe
zone through the bank zone. Small to medium shrubs are found in the bank and overbank zones
and beyond. Large shrub species and tree species are usually found in the transitional zone and the
upland zone. They should not be planted in the other zones because of their large stems. These
large stems do not give when high velocity stream flows hit them. In addition, the large stems tend
to block debris and ice that can cause significant bank erosion. Wetland herbaceous species can be
found throughout the streambank cross section, although most emergent aquatics will be found in
the toe zone (Bentrup and Hoag, 1998). See Appendix A and B for charts that list plant
characteristics for a variety of woody riparian plants from this region.
Figure1: Riparian Planting Zones can be used to determine where riparian species should be planted in relation to
the waterline. This is a general depiction of a riparian zone. Not all streams look like this one. In the real world,
some of these zones may be absent.
