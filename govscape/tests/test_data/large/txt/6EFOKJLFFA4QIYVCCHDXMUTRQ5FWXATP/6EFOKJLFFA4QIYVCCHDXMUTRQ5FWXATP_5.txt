86(cid:176) F). Seeds should be planted at 0.6 cm (0.25 inch). Greenhouse asexual propagation
information is very limited. Softwood cuttings taken in July and treated with 8,000 ppm IBA may
prove successful based on results with related species. Successful seedling percentage is about 50
percent. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is rarely successful. Root
cuttings can be taken and planted without treatment with fair success.
CHOKECHERRY - Prunus virginiana:
A shrub or small tree to 8 m (26 ft) with irregular rounded crown and often crooked trunk; bark is
thick, smooth to shallowly fissured, and dark reddish-brown to grayish-brown; branches are small,
erect to spreading with shiny bark; leaves alternate, simple, deciduous, broadest near base, tapering
to a pointed tip with fine sharply toothed margins, dark green above and light green below; flowers
produced in elongated white clusters; fruit is rounded, red to black, shinny, thick skinned, juicy
enclosing an egg shaped seed. Habitat is generally along riparian areas, moist slopes and it is most
common on well drained, older, more developed sandy to silty soils that afford good rooting depth
and high fertility. It can tolerate weakly saline soils, but is not tolerant of poor drainage or
prolonged flooding. It is a very important food plant for many wildlife species. Collect seed in mid-
August to mid-September; store clean, air-dried seed in sealed containers at 1(cid:176) C (34(cid:176) F) for up to 5
years; cold stratification at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F) for 120 to 160 days is recommended; Prechilling seed for 3
months at 20 to 30(cid:176) C is recommended; seed can be sown outdoors in the fall or spring to a depth of
1.3 cm (0.5 inch) in a moist, well drained media; heavy or poorly drained soils increase the risk of
disease losses. Greenhouse asexual propagation by softwood cuttings taken in the spring or early
summer, treat with rooting hormones and provide bottom heat under greenhouse conditions.
Transplant seedlings at one to two years age. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings is rarely successful. Root cuttings have had limited success.
CINQUEFOIL, SHRUBBY - Pentaphylloides floribunda:
A small shrub generally 0.25 to 0.75 m (1 to 2.5 ft) tall; branches with brownish shredding bark
and hairy young twigs; leaves are leathery, pinnate with 3-7 leaflets, silky above and silky to
whitish or greenish below; flowers yellow, axillary in small loose cymes. Habitat is generally moist
early and dry later in the growing season in open valleys from mid to high elevations. Soils vary
from clay loams to sandy loams and are fairly well developed with neutral to slightly acid pH. Seed
matures from July through September, dry seed stored at 1 to 5(cid:176) C (34 to 41(cid:176) F) is said to retain
viability for up to 5 years; seed will generally germinate well without pretreatment, although some
recommendations include a 60 day cold stratification at 1(cid:176) C (34(cid:176) F). Greenhouse asexual
propagation is by softwood cuttings taken in July and treated with 1,000 ppm IBA, in a 1:1,
peat:perlite or sand media under mist greenhouse conditions; rooting occurs in 3 to 4 weeks; reduce
watering once the cuttings have rooted. Transplant seedlings at one to two years of age. Field
propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is rarely successful.
COTTONWOOD, BLACK - Populus balsamifera spp. trichocarpa:
A medium to tall tree to 50 m (165 ft) with a narrow, rounded open to pointed crown and straight
trunk; bark is smooth, thin, yellowish-gray when young and turning dark grayish-brown, thick,
deeply and sharply furrowed with scaly ridges; branches are erect reddish-brown and marked by
orange pores when young, turning dark gray and roughened by leaf scars with age; leaves are
alternate, deciduous, simple, broadest near rounded or wedge shaped base, pointed at tip, finely
toothed, thick, leathery, dark green and smooth above and pale green or silvery white below with
rust colored spots; flowers, male and female on separate trees, males dense catkins, females loose
catkins; fruit, many three-parted hairy capsules in catkins containing numerous hairy seeds. Habitat
is typically mineral soil over gravel and cobble and sites are commonly flooded in spring with
