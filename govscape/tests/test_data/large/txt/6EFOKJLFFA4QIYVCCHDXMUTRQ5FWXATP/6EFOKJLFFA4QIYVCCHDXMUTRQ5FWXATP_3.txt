ALDER, SITKA - Alnus viridis:
A multiple stemmed shrub up to 3 m (10 ft) tall; bark is thin, smooth, reddish brown aging to
grayish-green; stems are somewhat three-sided with triangular pith; roots nitrogen fixing; leaves
alternate, deciduous, shiny green, double serrate with fine sharp teeth and sticky when young;
flowers catkins; fruit winged nutlet in semi-woody small cone. Habitat is moist montane woods and
streambanks at mid to lower elevations on coarse textured soils. Collect seed in the fall from trees
at least 4 to 7 years of age; fall collected and sown seed readily germinates; stored seed requires a
cold stratification period of 1 to 3 months at 3(cid:176) C (37(cid:176) F); fungicide powders prevent molding but
may reduce germination percentage. Transplant seedlings at one to two years of age into a well-
drained media with frequent watering and ample sunlight. Greenhouse asexual propagation and
Field propagation of dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is generally not successful.
ALDER, THINLEAF - Alnus incana spp. tenuifolia:
A large shrub up to 12 m (40 ft) tall; bark is thin, smooth, dirty green-gray and tends to flake when
older; stems are somewhat threesided, sometimes with short rusty hairs, and pith turns rusty color
when freshly cut; roots are nitrogen fixing; leaves are alternate, deciduous, dull green on both sides
and yellow-green on central vein, not sticky, with double dentate margins; flowers catkins; fruit
winged nutlet in semi-woody small cone. Habitat is moist montane woods and streambanks at mid
to lower elevations on coarse textured soils. Collect seed in September through November;
irregular crops every 1 to 4 years; fresh seed germinates without cold stratification; fall collected
and sown seed germinates readily; air-dried seed can be stored in sealed containers at 1 to 3(cid:176) C (34
to 37(cid:176) F) for up to ten years; dried/stored seed requires a 180 day cold stratification at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F)
before germination will occur. Transplant seedlings at one to two years old. Little information is
available on asexual propagation but the tendency for this species to form adventitious roots when
submerged in water suggests it is possible. Greenhouse asexual propagation - June and July
softwood cuttings treated with 8,000 ppm IBA is generally recommended for Alnus species. Field
propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is very difficult. It has been reported that
dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings will root if they are placed in soil that has been collected from
under mature alder. The theory is that the microbes will cause the cuttings to root. In addition,
small seedlings can be collected from under mature trees and potted in containers for eventual
reestablishment in riparian zones.
ASPEN, QUAKING - Populus tremuloides:
A small to medium tree to 25 m (80 ft) tall forming dense colonies; bark is smooth, greenish-white
to cream colored becoming blackish and rough with injury and age; leaves are alternate, deciduous,
almost round, finely toothed, shiny yellow-green above and pale below becoming bright yellow to
orange in fall, the laterally flattened petiole allows leaf to flutter in the slightest breeze; flowers
catkins. Habitat is streams, moist benches and mountain slopes at low to high elevations on sandy
to loamy soils. Susceptible to canker and fire, but readily suckers. Domestic livestock and wildlife
readily graze younger growth. Collect seed from late May to mid June, collection is improved by
pruning branches containing female catkins and then placing the cut ends in water under
greenhouse conditions with low relative humidity to encourage ripening. Storage information is
contradictory, one reference indicates that seed dried for three days at 24(cid:176) C (75(cid:176) F) will remain
viable for one year if stored at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F) at a moisture content of 5 to 8 percent; another indicates
that "dry" storage of seed for as little as two months results in dramatic drops in germination
percentage. Surface sow seed on a water-saturated media; seed readily germinates in the spring.
Greenhouse asexual propagation by root divisions (of suckers) and by lateral root propagation;
root cuttings are collected in the dormant stage (spring or fall), 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 inch) in
diameter and 2.5 cm (1 inch) long; plant 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 inch) deep in vermiculite under
