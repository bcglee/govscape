MACKENZIE WILLOW - S. prolixa (S. mackenzieana, S. rigida var. mackenzieana):
Tree-type; Small tree from 6-9 m (20-30 ft) tall; Thick-branched, with several thick limbs coming
from a very short base; wide crown; stems long, slender, and flexible with new stems glabrous and
glossy; leaves of medium length (5-7 times longer than wide), fine-toothed, and short pointed tip,
top is yellow-green while bottom is whitish with no hair underneath, no glands at base of leaf; new
stems reddish brown to yellowish, no hair; habitat and soils are similar to Pacific willow. Large tree
that should not be planted within the bankfull width. Plant at top of channel and on floodplain.
Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is moderately successful.
PACIFIC (WHIPLASH) WILLOW - S. lucida spp. lasiandra (S. lasiandra):
Tree-type; A tree up to 16 m (53 ft) tall with several branches that have stems between 10-30 cm
(4-12 in) in diameter. Bark ranges from moderately deep furrows on the older part of the stem to
smooth whitish bark on the younger part of the branch. The leaf is long, usually has a slight bend
at the top, and a very pointed tip. The leaf has the same color on both sides and 1-3 small dark
glands where the leaf meets the petiole. It is found in low to mid elevations, generally below 2000
m (6500 ft). At lower elevations, its form is a mid-sized tree, while at mid-elevation areas is has a
smaller shrubby stature. It prefers moist sandy to gravelly well-drained soils similar to those
preferred by cottonwoods. It is commonly associated with Drummond, Booth and yellow willow,
redosier dogwood, Woods rose, and alder species. Field propagation by dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings is very successful. For better rooting success, use younger smooth barked
stems. If using the older, larger diameter stems with rough furrowed bark, scar the rough bark with
an axe down to the cambium layer and use rooting hormones. This willow should not be planted in
the stream channel (within the bankfull width), but rather at the top of the bank and on the
floodplain.
PEACHLEAF WILLOW - S. amygdaloides:
Tree-type; small to tall tree with different references reporting height from 9-27 m (30-90 ft) tall
and single base from .3-1.2 m (1-4 ft) in diameter. It usually has 1-3 leaning trunks off the main
trunk. Leaves are long (6-7 times as long as wide), with a long point at the top. They are yellow-
green on the top and whitish underneath, hairless and fine-toothed, and without glands. The stems
are shiny, hairless, orange-yellow to red-brown, and drooping. The bark is dark with deep furrows
and sharp ridges at the base going up to smooth lighter bark on middle aged branches. Its habitat is
mainly mid-elevation. Prefers fertile soils near water or on alluvial soils with moving subsurface
water. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is rarely successful. High
establishment success has been found with younger-aged wood. This willow is ideal for planting
into rock riprap on upper bank. It should not be planted within the bankfull width, but at the top of
bank and on the floodplain.
PLAINLEAF WILLOW - S. planifolia var. planifolia:
Shrub-type; Medium shrub from 2-4 m (6-13 ft) tall. New stems are glabrous and older stems are
dark red or brown and glabrous to waxy. Leaves are glabrous, dark green (occasionally red-tinged)
and shiny above, glabrous beneath, not toothed. It is called the "parallel-veined willow" because the
lateral veins in the leaves are partially parallel to the main vein. Found at mid-elevation 1680-2350
m (5500-7700 ft) in moist streamside and bottomlands of the mountain big sagebrush/grass zone.
Preferred soils are varied from deep silts, clay, sand, or gravel. Associated with Bebb, Booth,
Geyer, yellow, and coyote willows. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is
moderately successful.
