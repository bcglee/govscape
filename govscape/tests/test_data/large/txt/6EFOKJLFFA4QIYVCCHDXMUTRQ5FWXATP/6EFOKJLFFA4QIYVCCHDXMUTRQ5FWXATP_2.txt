SPECIES DESCRIPTIONS AND PROPAGATION TECHNIQUES
The following information describes riparian woody plant species, their typical habitat, greenhouse
propagation methods, and field propagation methods. Greenhouse propagation methods are
procedures that can be used to produce bareroot or containerized plants. These procedures
generally require greenhouse space, greenhouse equipment and supplies, some greenhouse
propagation skill, and adequate time to grow the plants before transferring to your project location.
Field propagation methods are procedures for planting unrooted dormant hardwood cuttings,
literally branch or stems, into the various riparian planting zones. Unrooted cuttings are easy to
plant, inexpensive, easy to collect, and capable of being planted deep enough to reach the low water
level of the year. They can withstand high water velocities associated with seasonal out of bank
flows. Not all woody plant species can be propagated from unrooted cuttings. Unrooted cuttings
will have a lower survival rate, but are less expensive when compared to bareroot or containerized
stock.
Dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings can be taken after leaf fall and before bud burst in the spring.
The best rooting success is from cuttings that are 2-10 years old. The cutting diameter should be as
large as possible depending upon species. The best diameters are 1.9-7.6 cm (0.75 to 3 in). The
cutting should be long enough to reach 20-30 cm (8-12 in) into the lowest water level of the year.
The top 2 feet of the cutting should be removed to provide higher energy to the auxiliary buds, i.e.
root buds. All side branches should be removed to ensure that the stored energy is not expended to
supporting branches or reproductive materials, but rather to grow roots. Willows have root
primordia up and down the entire stem so roots will grow not only at the nodes, but also out of the
internodes. Cuttings should be soaked in water long enough (commonly 5-7 days) to allow the
buds to swell. Do not allow the roots to emerge from the bark. Hormone applications are not
necessary for large volume plantings. Hormones may be used and valuable for cuttings older than
10-12 years or cuttings that have thick rough bark.
ALDER, RED - Alnus rubra:
A rapidly growing tree up to 25 m (80 ft) tall; bark is thin, smooth and often appearing white
mottled due to crutose lichens; pith and cambium in stems turns rusty color when freshly cut; roots
nitrogen fixing; leaves alternate, deciduous, shiny dark green above, lighter below with rusty
pubescence along veins on underside, double serrated; flowers catkins; fruit winged nutlet in semi-
woody small cone. Habitat is slightly moist to wet soils at lower elevations. Harvest ripe seed in
September and October; air dry to prevent molding; short term storage by refrigeration, long term
storage at less than 10 percent moisture content and freezer-stored in moisture-proof containers at -
12(cid:176) to -13(cid:176) C (10.4 to 8.6(cid:176) F) for up to 5 years without loss of viability. Fresh seed sown in the fall
readily germinates, do not cover the seed, adequate water and a low nitrogen, high phosphorus
fertilizer enhances germination and growth. Transplant seedlings at one to two years old.
Greenhouse asexual propagation by softwood cuttings from young trees (< 7 years old), 6 to 12
cm (2.4 to 4.7 in) long, 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.16 inch) in diameter, treat with approximately 3,000
ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), media of 1:1, perlite:vermiculite at 25(cid:176) C (77(cid:176) F); transplant to a
1:1:1, vermiculite:perlite:sandy loam soil; leave in greenhouse for five weeks at 21(cid:176) C (70(cid:176) F) days
and 15(cid:176) C (59(cid:176) F) nights; Outplant the following year. Field propagation by dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings is rare. Small seedlings can be collected from under mature trees and potted in
containers for eventual reestablishment in riparian zones.
