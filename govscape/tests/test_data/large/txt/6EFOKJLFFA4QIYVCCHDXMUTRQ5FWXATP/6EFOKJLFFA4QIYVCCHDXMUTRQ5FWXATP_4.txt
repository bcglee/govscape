greenhouse conditions for 6 weeks, separate suckers and plant in a 1:1 vermiculite:perlite mix
under mist until rooting occurs. Pot up to larger sizes in a peat:vermiculite mix and grow under
greenhouse conditions prior to hardening-off. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood
cuttings is rare. Root cuttings at least 13-15 cm (5â€“6 in) long with 1-2 stems about 1.2-1.8 m (4-6
ft) high have been moderately successful when planted in slightly moist soils.
BOXELDER - Acer negundo:
A small to medium tree to 20 m (65 ft) tall often with an irregular shape; bark is light brown to
gray, thin on younger trees thickening with age, deep furrowed with broad rounded ridges;
branches are stout, widely spreading to upright; leaves are opposite, deciduous, pinnately
compound with 3 to rarely 5 leaflets per leaf, pointed tipped, often broad uneven base, coarse teeth
along margins, light green above and paler and hairy below; flowers calyx females, stamen males
on separate trees; fruits in hanging clusters, two winged. Habitat is lowland sites along streams,
rivers, ponds, or flooded flats on a variety of soils. Tolerant of prolonged flooding. Seed requires
both a pretreatment and a cold stratification period to break dormancy; northern sources have a
shorter cold stratification requirement than southern sources. Pretreatment involves two weeks of
soaking in cold water or a physical rupturing or removal of the pericarp prior to cold stratification;
recommendations vary from 21 days at 20(cid:176) C in sand or peat medium up to 2 - 3 months at 4(cid:176) C
(40(cid:176) F). A high percentage of empty seeds can be expected. Transplant seedlings at one to two years
old. Greenhouse asexual propagation of softwood stem cuttings works well when the cuttings are
treated with 8,000 ppm IBA talc and can be taken up until mid September. Field propagation by
dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is rarely successful.
BIRCH, WATER (BLACK) - Betula occidentalis:
A small tree or large shrub up to 10 m (30 ft) tall frequently found in crowded dense thickets; bark
is thin, smooth, with horizontal pores, almost black on young trees, turning reddish-brown with
age; branches are slender, upright, covered with numerous glands (small bumps); leaves are
alternate, deciduous, with rounded wedge shaped base and pointed tip, entire near base extending
to double row of fine sharp-pointed teeth, dark greenish-yellow and shiny above, paler and gland
dotted below, sometimes tufts of hair at junctions of veins; flower catkins male and female same
tree; fruit tiny winged seed in hanging or spreading small cone. Habitat is along rivers, streams,
springs and moist locations at mid elevations on a variety of gravelly, cobbly to medium textured
soils. Sow fresh seed in late summer to fall or prechill seed for 21 days at 20 to 30(cid:176) C and sow in
spring. Press seed into soil or very lightly cover with soil (sunlight is very important in the
propagation process). Transplant young seedlings at one to two years old. Seedlings require shade
during summer. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is rarely successful.
BUFFALOBERRY, SILVER - Shepherdia argentea:
A spreading shrub occasionally forming thickets to 5 m (16 ft) tall; bark is dull gray, thin, smooth
when young becoming somewhat ridged and shredding when older; branches are short, stout and
younger stems are covered with dense, silvery-white scales; leaves are opposite, simple, widest
near the middle, rounded at base and tip, leathery and covered on both sides with dense silvery
scales; flowers, male and female on separate plants, male flowers in small clusters and female
flowers on short stalks both near the tip of branchlets; fruit is produced singly or in clusters, round,
somewhat fleshy, smooth, bright red and enclosing an egg-shaped, flattened seed. Habitat is
generally seasonally wet, well-drained alluvial floodplains near rivers and streams on sandy to
coarse texture soils. It is tolerant of some flooding, but is intolerant of prolonged flooding and
permanent high water tables. Both hard seed coats and embryo dormancy occur requiring 20 to 30
minutes of acid scarification followed by 60 to 90 days of cold stratification at 20(cid:176) to 30(cid:176) C (68 to
