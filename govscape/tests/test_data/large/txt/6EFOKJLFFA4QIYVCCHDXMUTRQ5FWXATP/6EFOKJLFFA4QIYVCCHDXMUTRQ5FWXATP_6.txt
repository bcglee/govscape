watertable dropping below 40 in later in growing season. These sites are typically excessively
drained with low waterholding capabilities that allow rapid movement of highly aerated
groundwater. Greenhouse asexual propagation by seed is difficult because the seed is very small
and short-lived (most references indicated the seed is viable for 24-48 hours). Planting by seed
requires surface broadcasting with no cover and extended surface moisture to ensure seedlings do
not dry out. Field propagation of this species is relatively easily. They can be propagated with
dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings. Ensure the base is placed into permanent moist zone.
Recommendations are that the cutting be long and tapering. Cut off the top 0.6-0.94 m (2-3 ft) to
enhance rooting. Remove by rubbing with a glove all but the top 4-5 buds. This will result in tree-
like growth rather than shrub-like growth.
COTTONWOOD, FREMONTâ€™S - Populus fremomtii:
A medium to tall tree to 30 m (100 ft) with broad, open crown and short trunk; bark is thick,
smooth on younger trees, turning rough, and splitting with age, light gray to brownish to white;
branches are stout and spreading, light green and smooth when young and turning yellow-gray with
roughened leaf scars with age; leaves are alternate, deciduous, simple, triangular, with a very broad
base and tapering tip, irregularly toothed, thick and firm, coated with hairs when young and light
yellowish-green; flowers, male dense catkins, female loose catkins; fruit, 3-4 parted egg-shaped
capsules in catkins containing light brown seeds covered with silky hairs. Habitat, southwestern
tree found in mid to low elevations on moist soils near streams, rivers and ponds. This species does
well in saline areas. Greenhouse asexual propagation by seed is difficult because the seed is very
small and short-lived (most references indicated the seed is viable for 24-48 hours). Planting by
seed requires surface broadcasting with no cover and extended surface moisture to ensure seedlings
do not dry out. Field propagation of this species is more difficult then other cottonwoods possibly
because of different cambial thickness and/or bark properties. They can be propagated with
dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings. Ensure the base is placed into permanent moist zone.
Recommendations are that the cutting be long and tapering. Cut off the top 0.6-0.94 m (2-3 ft) to
enhance rooting. Remove by rubbing with a glove all but the top 4-5 buds. This will result in tree-
like growth rather than shrub-like growth.
COTTONWOOD, NARROWLEAF - Populus angustifolia:
A small to medium tree to 18 m (60 ft) tall with a narrow cone shaped crown; bark is smooth, thin,
yellowish-green when young becoming thicker at base of older trees and shallowly fissured with
broad flat ridges; branches are strong, slender, upright, yellowish-green when young becoming
bright to dark orange by fall and turning pale-gray in subsequent years; leaves are alternate,
deciduous, simple, lance shaped, broadest near middle, tapering to pointed tip, fine toothed along
edges, thin and papery, bright yellow-green above and paler below; flowers, male and females on
separate trees in dense catkins; fruit is a two part egg-shaped capsule containing hair brown seeds.
Habitat is generally at mid elevations along streams with large amount of coarse substrates such as
gravel and cobbles where watertable commonly drops below 40 in later in the growing season.
These sites are commonly flooded in spring and are typically excessively drained with low
waterholding capabilities that allow rapid movement of highly aerated groundwater. Greenhouse
asexual propagation by seed is difficult because the seed is very small and short-lived (most
references indicated the seed is viable for 24-48 hours). Planting by seed requires surface
broadcasting with no cover and extended surface moisture to ensure seedlings do not dry out. Field
propagation of this species is relatively easily. They can be propagated with dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings. Ensure the base is placed into permanent moist zone. Recommendations are
that the cutting be long and tapering. Cut off the top 0.6-0.94 m (2-3 ft) to enhance rooting.
