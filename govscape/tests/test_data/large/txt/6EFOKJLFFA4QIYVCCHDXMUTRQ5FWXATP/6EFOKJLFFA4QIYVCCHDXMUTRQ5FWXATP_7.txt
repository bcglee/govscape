Remove by rubbing with a glove all but the top 4-5 buds. This will result in tree-like growth rather
than shrub-like growth.
CURRENT, GOLDEN - Ribes aureum:
An erect to rounded shrub to 2-3 m (6-10 ft) tall; stems are reddish, glabrous to finely hairy when
young and glabrous, dark gray when older; leaves are mostly three-lobed to less than half their
length, and wedge to heart-shaped at base, green to yellow-green, warm yellow in fall; flowers are
golden yellow, borne in a ascending calyx with spreading lobes and a narrow tubular hypanthium;
Fruit is berries, round, glabrous, dark red to black and sometimes yellow and tart. Habitat includes
river floodplains, streambanks, and moist ravines at mid elevations and on well-developed soils.
This species can be propagated from seed or cuttings. Seeds are highly dormant and require 12 to
18 weeks of cold moist prechilling of freshly harvested seed, followed by a warm stratification and
then continued prechilling to break dormancy. Greenhouse asexual propagation is by dormant,
hardwood cuttings taken from late fall through early spring (one-two year wood), approximately of
pencil diameter, wounded, with or without a heel, treated with 5,000 to 8,000 PPM IBA, a 1:1,
vermiculite:perlite or sand media, under mist, under greenhouse conditions (35 to 65% rooting can
be expected). Transplants should be placed in field at one to two years of age. Field propagation
by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is somewhat successful. Rooting hormones are
recommended to improve success rate.
CURRENT, WAX (SQUAW) - Ribes cereum:
A spreading to round shrub 1-2 m (3-7 ft) tall; stems are finely hairy, turning grayish to reddish-
brown with age; leaves are kidney-wedge-fan shaped and shallowly 3-5 lobed with toothed edges,
glabrous to downy with both surfaces somewhat glandular, dark green; flowers are both hairy and
sticky, greenish-white to white, pink tinged with a nearly cylindrical hypanthium; fruit is berries,
smooth, round, bright red and bitter. Habitat ranges widely from mid to high elevations on drier
riparian slopes, foothills, to ponderosa pine forests, dry rocky southerly slopes and subalpine zones.
Seeds usually mature in August. Depulp in a blender or macerator; cool, dry storage is
recommended; cool, moist stratification (12 to 18 weeks) is required for freshly harvested seed
prior to sowing. In some cases, a cold:warm:cold stratification series is needed to break dormancy;
treatment with low concentrations of gibberellins for 1 to 8 days has been shown to produce
germination rates of 30 to 55%; seed sown directly outdoors in December had only 1 percent
germination by April in one study. Greenhouse asexual propagation by hardwood cuttings taken
in June with a heel and treated with 8,000 ppm IBA, under mist. Transplants should be placed in
field at one to two years of age. Field propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings as
described for Ribes aureum should also work.
DOGWOOD, REDOSIER - Cornus sericea:
A thicket forming shrub, seldom with a single trunk to 5 m (16 ft) tall; bark is thin, smooth with
prominent lenticels, red to occasionally greenish; branches rise, spread or bend downward to
ground, smooth, slender and reddish to purplish red color; leaves are opposite, simple, deciduous,
broadest near rounded base, tapering to a pointed tip, smooth along edge, dark green and smooth
above, and covered with soft white hairs when young below becoming smooth when older, with
unique 5-7 prominent upcurving and parallel veins that converge at tip of leaf; flowers in many
four-lobed hairy calyx flat-topped clusters; fruit produced in round-topped clusters, round, dull
white, thin flesh enclosing a egg-shaped, furrowed seed. Habitat is usually along streams, rivers,
and other moist sites from low to relatively high elevations on soils that are commonly young with
little to no development overlying gravel and cobbles. These sites are typically well to excessively
drained with low waterholding capabilities that allow rapid movement of highly aerated
