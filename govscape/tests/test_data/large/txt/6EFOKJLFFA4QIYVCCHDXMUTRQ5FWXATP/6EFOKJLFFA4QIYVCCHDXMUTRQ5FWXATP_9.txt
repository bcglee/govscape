and other drier riparian locations on well drained moist soils at low to mid elevations. Fruit ripens
from June through September. Cleaning, handling, and storage of seed is the same as Sambucus
cerulea; Pretreatment of seed includes HSO scarification for 5 minutes followed by a two day
2 4
water soak, then warm stratification for 10 weeks followed by cold chilling for 12 weeks at 20 to
30(cid:176) C (68 to 86(cid:176) F); fresh seed may be fall sown, or stratify stored seed as previously described
before spring planting, germination typically occurs the second spring. Greenhouse asexual
propagation is by softwood cuttings taken in June or July. A basal cut just below a node and
removal of 30 to 40 percent of the foliage is recommended. Treat cuttings with Captan fungicide
solution and approximately 3,000 to 5,000 ppm IBA. Place in vermiculite or a 1:1, peat:perlite mix,
under mist with or without 60% shade for several weeks. Hot, humid greenhouse conditions are
said to favor rooting, however, excessive moisture may cause the foliage to rot. Approximately
30% rooting can be expected. Young seedlings can be transplanted at 1-2 years of age. Field
propagation by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is somewhat successful under conditions
described for Blue elderberry. Note that cuttings do not do well in cold storage and should be
planted early enough in the field to allow enough time to become established before winter. It can
also be propagated by sprouts, rhizomes, and layering.
HAWTHORN, BLACK - Crataegus douglasii
HAWTHORN, DOUGLAS - Crataegus douglasii var. douglasii:
An erect shrub to small tree up to 10 m (33 ft) tall; branches are zigzagging stems, armed with stout
1 inch thorns and reddish brown in color aging to dirty gray; leaves are alternate, deciduous,
obovate, irregularly toothed and can be 5-9 shallowly lobed, dark green to red when growing in full
sunlight; flowers in axillary clusters, white; fruit is a small dark reddish purple to black globe-
shaped apple in clusters. Habitat is generally in drier locations of riparian zones on clay loam to
sandy loam soils at low to mid elevations. Watertable is generally within 40 in of the surface in
spring or during high runoff events, but falls below this level later in the growing season. This
species is tolerant of poorly drained soils and semi-prolonged flooding. Fruit ripens late-July
through August, percent fill varies widely among trees necessitating frequent cutting tests, separate
seed by macerating fruit and floating off pulp and empties, spread seed in thin layers to avoid heat
build-up; Air dried seed can be stored for 2 to 3 years at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F); Propagation by seed requires
pretreatment with acid for 0.5 to 3.0 hours followed by cold stratification at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F) for 84 to
112 days, germination of 50 to 80 percent is common, seed may be fall sown after pretreatment or
held in cold storage after scarification until the following spring, sow seeds approximately 0.5 cm
(0.2 inch) in depth or broadcast sow and cover to a similar depth with soil; transplant from seedbed
before the second growing season, fresh seed may be fall sown directly without pretreatment,
however, it may be two or more years before germination occurs. Greenhouse asexual
propagation is possible by using suckers or by layering. . Field propagation by dormant unrooted
hardwood cuttings is rarely successful.
SILVERBERRY - Elaeagnus commutata:
A multi-stemmed, deciduous shrub from 1.5 to 2.4 m (5 to 8 ft) tall, erect habit with slender and
sometimes twisted branches, new stems are initially a light to medium brown color, the bark
becoming dark gray, but remaining smooth, with age; the leaves are deciduous, alternate, 38 to 89
mm (1.5 to 3.5 inches) long and 19 to 38 mm (0.75 to 1.5 inches) wide; oval to narrowly ovate in
shape, leaf margin entire, covered on both sides with silvery white scales, the bottom sometimes
with brown spots; the highly fragrant, yellow flowers are perfect, trumpet-shaped (tubular),
approximately 13 mm (0.5 inches) in length, borne in the leaf axils in May; the fruit is a silvery-
colored, (0.3 inch) long, egg-shaped drupe that ripens in September-October, some fruit may
persist on the plant until well into December; the seed is readily cleaned by processing in a
