macerator, floating off the pulp, and then air drying; cleaned seed stored in sealed containers at 6 to
14 percent moisture content remains viable for up to 2 years. Propagation by seed is quite easy,
fresh seed germinates readily with little (60 days or less) or no cold chilling. Late fall field sown
seed germinates the next spring, spring sown seed usually germinates the same spring. Greenhouse
asexual propagation with dormant hardwood cuttings treated with 3,000 ppm IBA, under mist
with bottom heat, results in 80 percent, or better, rooting. This species spreads readily, sometimes
profusely, by suckers. Information on the Field propagation of this species by dormant, unrooted
hardwood cuttings is not available, but may prove successful on favorable sites. This native species
is sometimes confused with the weedy, introduced small tree Russian olive, Elaeagnus
angustifolia. Tolerates droughty, high pH and saline sites well.
SNOWBERRY, COMMON - Symphoricarpos albus:
A small, twiggy shrub from 30 to 150 cm (1 to 5 ft), the stems are erect, slender, and rounded with
a hollow pith, the bark is brown, peeling and becoming stringy with age; the leaves are deciduous,
opposite, simple, bluish-green in color, oval to elliptic-oblong, approximately 19 to 51 mm (0.75 to
2 inches) long, obtuse, roundish; the perfect, pinkish flowers are bell-like in shape, borne in
terminal spikes on the current season’s growth, usually in May to June; the fruit is a berry-like
drupe, pure white, growing in dense clusters, approximately 15 mm (0.6 in) in diameter, ripening in
September and October and sometimes persisting well into the winter months. Habitat - often
found on alluvial terraces on major streams and rivers in mountain and foothill areas, but
infrequently in dryer regions. Tolerates a wide variety of conditions including high pH, high clay,
droughty, and medium shade sites. The seed is easily cleaned by maceration, floating off of the
pulp, followed by air-drying of the seed. Propagation by seed requires a combination of 2 to 3
months warm stratification at about 21°C (70°F) followed by 4 to 5 months cold chilling at 5°C
(41°F), 40 to 60 minutes of acid scarification prior to warm stratification may increase germination;
germination is erratic and varies by year and even seed source; seed dried and then stored in sealed
containers at 5°C (41°F) remains viable for up to 2 years; Greenhouse asexual propagation by
softwood and dormant hardwood cuttings both root readily under greenhouse conditions that
include 1,000 to 3,000 ppm IBA, bottom heat, and overhead mist. This species suckers profusely
but is generally not weedy.
SYRINGA (MOCKORANGE) - Philadelphus lewisii:
A loosely branched medium to tall shrub 1-3 m (3 to 10 ft) tall; bark is brown with older stems
showing a characteristic cross-checked pattern and eventually flaking off; leaves are opposite,
deciduous, simple with a few to many rounded teeth on edges, light green, smooth to stiffly hairy
with 3 major veins from base; flowers are numerous, very sweetly-scented, white, in terminal
racemes on lateral branches; fruit is a nearly round capsule. Habitat is mostly in foothills and
montane zone in ponderosa pine and Douglas fir forests, and in dry, rocky, moist streamside areas.
Fruit is collected in late summer and is processed by gentle crushing of the dried capsules and then
using wind from a clipper or similar machine to separate the seed from the chaff, cold stratify the
seed for 8 weeks at 5(cid:176) C (41(cid:176) F) prior to sowing; Greenhouse asexual propagation is by softwood
and hardwood stem cuttings, softwood cuttings are taken in June and July, treated with 1,000 ppm
IBA, and stuck in a 1:1, peat:perlite media, under mist. Dormant hardwood cuttings are collected in
late fall to early spring. They are treated with 2,500 to 8,000 ppm IBA, stuck in a sandy mix, under
mist. Fall plantings should be mulched. Transplant at one to two years of age. . Field propagation
by dormant unrooted hardwood cuttings is moderately successful. Moisture is the key to success.
