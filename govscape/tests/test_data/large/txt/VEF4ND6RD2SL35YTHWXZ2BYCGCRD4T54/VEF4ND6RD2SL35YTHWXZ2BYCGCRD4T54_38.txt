issues, although they have applicability to our national needs in the food safety system.
One of the advantages of special grants is the ability to fund research on rapidly emerging
issues. Since RFAs are not issued for special grants, the program has funded a wide array
of topics. There are many success stories associated with this program area. Described
below are selected examples of successful and meaningful research projects.
Success stories
Auburn Universityâ€™s Detection and Food Safety Center has developed a method of food
inspection that involves the placement of a sensor chip on food items with a high
moisture content (i.e. meat and poultry surfaces). The goal is for these chips to
automatically inventory and assess food safety of appropriate fresh food products at any
point by measuring the presence of food borne pathogens. In addition to the chip, a hand-
held bacterial detection device is being developed. Interim results have produced a hand-
held biosensor that will allow food processors to detect the presence of bacterial
pathogens and toxins within 100 seconds. Current industrial methods require that a food
sample be taken to a lab where tests require a minimum of 6 to 48 hours to determine if
the food is safe to eat. The new technology can identify harmful levels of Salmonella, for
example, and will be packaged as a portable hand-held unit that may be used on the food
production line. Researchers at Auburn are currently field-testing this hand-held device.
If the hand-held device, and the radio frequency identification sensor chip are successful,
the potential savings to the food industry will be large.
Another project is aimed at preventing contamination of milk and milk products by
Listeria. A research team at Pennsylvania State University is developing a Multi Locus
Sequence Typing method for molecular tracking of Listeria monocytogenes in dairy
processing plants to track the path of contamination and identify critical control points for
HACCP intervention. This project is a good example of integrating research with
outreach activity since the objective is to prevent microbial contamination of diary
products in the processing plant. The investigators also will identify non-microbial
indicators (alkaline phosphatase and other enzymes) of pasteurization by high pressure
processing and ultrasound and develop biosensors for the best non-microbial candidate.
Special research grants were awarded to Iowa State University to investigate food
irradiation. These studies have had significant impacts in the development of new
regulations by FSIS and the FDA for food irradiation. The outputs from these grants
provided a sound scientific basis for these regulatory agencies to develop regulations in
irradiation of meat and poultry products. The investigators also collaborated with ARS in
providing the science basis for the regulations.
The Food Safety Consortium is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary program funded
by a special grant. This Consortium includes Iowa State University, Arkansas State
University, and Kansas State University. Each of these universities concentrate on food
safety research, education, and extension issues in the pork (IA), beef (KS), and poultry
(AK). (http://www.uark.edu/depts/fsc). There are specific success stories within this
consortium project that need to be mentioned.
