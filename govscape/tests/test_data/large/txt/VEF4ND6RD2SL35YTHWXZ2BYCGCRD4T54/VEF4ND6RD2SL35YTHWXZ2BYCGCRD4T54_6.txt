The possibility of intentional contamination of the food supply or pathogen attacks on
crops and livestock defines the need to conduct research to keep the U.S. food supply
safe by incorporating a biologically-based (biodefense) strategy to reduce vulnerabilities.
Novel scientific strategies must be developed to meet new threats.
The agencies within the Research, Economics, and Education (REE) Missionary Area
will provide producers, manufacturers, regulatory agencies, and consumers scientific
information and technologies, to support their efforts to provide affordable and safe food.
This portfolio supports Objective 3.1: “Reduce the Incidence of Food Borne Illnesses
Through Science-Based Knowledge and Education” of CSREES Goal 3: “Enhance
Protection and Safety of the Nation’s Agriculture and Food Supply.”
Central to providing a safe food supply is preventing the contamination of food by
pathogens or toxins throughout production, processing, and distribution. Contamination
of food can result from complex and diverse factors such as agricultural practices, the use
of manure, water quality, weather, plant and animal genetics, industrial hygiene, storage
and packaging, transportation, and food preparation. The safety of the food supply has
long been a priority; the increased threat of the intentional introduction of pathogens and
toxins has placed more emphasis on food safety in general and specifically on methods to
prevent and detect contamination during processing and distribution.
Basic science and the resulting technology are keys to both preventing and detecting
contamination of the food supply by pathogens and toxins. Training and information are
essential for everyone from producer to consumer to carry out their role in promoting
food safety.
Performance Goal: Provide scientific information to better understand and control the
introduction of pathogens into the food system from production to consumption.
Performance Goal: Develop and transfer to USDA and other government agencies and
to the private sector systems that rapidly and accurately detect, identify, and differentiate
the most critical and economically important food borne pathogens.
Performance Goal: Provide the timely release of chemical usage statistics for fruits and
vegetables.
Performance Goal: Provide education and training to producers, the workforce, and
consumers on their role in promoting food safety and responding to threats to the safety
of the food supply.
Actionable Strategies:
• Support and conduct microbial genomic research to provide the basis for
detection, diagnosis and mitigation of food borne pathogens.
