Vegetables. Other activities included the formation of many national and interagency
task forces and working groups such as the Joint Institute for Food Safety Research, the
Risk Assessment Consortium, and the National Food Safety System. Major initiatives
included the implementation of the 1996 Pathogen Reduction and Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Point (HACCP) rule, which was passed to help reduce microbial
pathogens in processing plants and to clarify federal and industry roles. The culmination
of these efforts was the signing of the National Strategic Food Safety Plan in January
2000. The broad goal of the strategic plan was “the protection of public health by
significantly reducing the prevalence of food borne hazards through science-based and
coordinated regulations, surveillance, inspection, enforcement, research, and education
programs.” The plan also established an outcome measurement. The goal by 2004 was a
25% decline in the incidence of the most common food borne illnesses and a 50%
reduction in residues of carcinogenic and neurotoxic pesticides on foods. In 2002, The
Food Safety Council became the Presidential Food Safety and Security Council, which
was redefined to include the threat of bioterrorism. The Public Health Security and
Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 has changed the focus of some
activities and initiatives. See (http://www.fda.gov/oc/bioterrorism/bioact.html). During
the time period of the current peer review, several new research, outreach, and
educational initiatives within CSREES were developed to address the need for new
information to be able to make decisions based on sound science. These new programs
included the National Integrated Food Safety Initiative (NIFSI) and the Epidemiologic
Approaches in Food Safety initiative.
