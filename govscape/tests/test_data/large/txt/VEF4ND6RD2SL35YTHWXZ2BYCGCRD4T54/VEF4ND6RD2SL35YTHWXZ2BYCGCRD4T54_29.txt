immunology-based and management-based strategies) that target different
segments of the poultry production system.
• A food safety course was taught in Chile that was based on current research of
Salmonella in dairy cattle.
• Prevention of fecal contamination of water tanks and control of vermin in cattle
pens may reduce E. coli O157. However, control of management factors alone
will not completely prevent fecal shedding of E. coli O157 in feedlot cattle.
Research has shown that water chlorination alone will not reduce E. coli 0157.
The geometry of the water source is an important factor.
• Research on Campylobacter in poultry in Iceland has produced the potential to
create a standard for allowable levels of Campylobacter in poultry rinses
supported by both FSIS and the North American poultry industry. This research
has shown that freezing poultry carcasses reduce Campylobacter because of its
sensitivity to freezing. Iceland has adopted this practice of freezing chicken if it is
contaminated with Campylobacter. Food borne cases have decreased
significantly. Both Norway and Sweden are considering this practice.
• Development of a statistically validated method for spatial sampling of abattoir
holding pens.
• Presentation of data on Salmonella spread on farms to dairy industry groups and
to veterinarian and producer extension programs. Consequently, these researchers
have been involved with producers to reduce on-farm Salmonella contamination
by changing water use practices.
• Participation in several workshops on the role of on-farm use of antibiotics and
providing guidance for prudent use of antibiotics.
• Several investigators have contributed their research results in chapters in a new
microbial food safety book.
Outcomes
Short-Term
• The entire March Issue, 2005 of the Journal of Food borne Diseases will have
published research that was funded by this program. Thirteen research papers
will cover various emerging epidemiologic research in food safety.
• A continued significant presence at national meetings. From 2001-04,
epidemiologic research has been presented at the Annual meeting of the American
Veterinary Medical Association and the Conference of Research Workers in
Animal Diseases. These activities help to disseminate new knowledge generated
through the program.
• A workshop on Epidemiologic Approaches for Food Safety was convened in
2000 as a result of this program. This workshop was supported by CSREES,
CDC, Association of Teachers of Veterinary Preventive Medicine and Public
Health, and the American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine and was
held in conjunction with the U.S. Animal Health Association. This was the first
workshop to specifically address epidemiologic methods and their application in
food safety research. This workshop served as a catalyst for new food safety
