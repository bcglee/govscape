• Over 425 publications have been listed in USDA’s Current Research Information
System (CRIS) as resulting from NRI-funded projects. This only includes papers
published or in press up to December, 2003. Selected examples are cited under
Success Stories.
• Six equipment grants were made to strengthen the capacity for food safety
research in small to mid-size institutions and institutions less successful in
obtaining NRI funds. These included purchase of a spiral plating system for the
University of Maine; pulsed-field gel electrophoresis equipment for Mississippi
State University; and LC/MS equipment for the University of Wyoming.
• In Fiscal Year 2003, NRI-funded projects provided financial support for 24
graduate students for 678 months and for 2 postdoctoral fellows for 58 months.
• Of the 136 projects funded by NRI during this time period, at least 15 included
partnerships between multiple institutions. Examples are partnerships between
researchers at the University of Nebraska and Cornell University on a project
entitled “Population Genomics of Listeria monocytogenes” and collaboration
between researchers at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and University of
Maryland on several projects relating to antimicrobial resistance.
Outcomes
Short-term outcomes
The 2005 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report cited publications by a
CSREES-funded collaboration of researchers from the Ohio State University,
Washington State University, and Colorado State University. The committee’s report
will be used by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to write
the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which is the major policy statement for
consumer nutrition and food safety issues. This group has received two NRI grants, as
well as a grant from the NIFSI.
Additionally, a publication resulting from the CSREES-funded projects was featured as a
cover story of the November, 2004 Journal of the American Dietetic Association
(Medeiros, L.C., Hillers, V.N., Chen, G., Bergmann, V., Kendall, P. and Schoeder, M.,
Design and Development of Food Safety Knowledge and Attitude Scales for Consumer
Food Safety Education. J. Amer. Diet. Assoc., 104:1671-1677, 2004). The researchers
developed and pilot-tested knowledge and attitude questions regarding food safety with
groups of low-income nutrition education program participants and college students.
They used reliability and validity tests of individual items to reduce the scales to 18
knowledge questions and 10 attitude questions. The knowledge questionnaire may be
used by educators to assess subject matter knowledge before and after instruction. The
attitude scale can be used by researchers and educators to assess outcomes of food safety
educational programs. This group is continuing their research by working with high-risk
audiences (e.g. older adults, pregnant women and persons with compromised immune
function).
