• Recently, research done on biosensors at University of Arkansas-Fayetteville has
led to collaboration with Biodetection Device Inc. for a new company and
received a grant from NSF-SBIR. These devices will be scaled up and show an
ability to detect as few as 90 cells of E.coli O157:H7 in 2.5 hours with no
enrichment using a chemiluminescent fiber optic-based sensor.
• The FSC designed and maintained a Food Safety Web Page that includes a
HACCP demonstration site for small meat processors
(http://www.iowahaccp.iastate.edu). In addition, they now have web-based food
safety lessons and on-line presentations on biotechnology issues
(http://www.extension.iastate.edu/food safety/biotech/slideshow/index.htm). An
average of 30 high school teachers visit the site per month.
• In collaboration with Sandia National Labs, FSC developed Decon Foam- 100 for
use against resistant B. anthracis spores in ready to eat foods. This is a potential
application in biosecurity.
