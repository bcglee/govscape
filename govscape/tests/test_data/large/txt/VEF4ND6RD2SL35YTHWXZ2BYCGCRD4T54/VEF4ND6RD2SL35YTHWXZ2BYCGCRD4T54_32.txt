A third significant study of E.coli being performed by David Smith at University of
Nebraska is based on the detection and prevention of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. Through
a population-based study, Dr. Smith tested a simple detection method for feedlot cattle
(that would lower stress and handling) for E.coli. This rope device has proven to be
useful for other pathogens as well and is in the process of being patented. It has been used
by other investigators in other research studies as well.
In parallel, another study entitled “Effect of water chlorination on prevalence of E.coli
0157:H7 and Campylobacter in Feedlot Cattle being performed at Washington State
University (Besser et al) evaluated the commonly believe hypothesis that chlorination of
cattle water sources can significantly reduce the prevalence of infection of cattle with
E.coli and Campylobacter sp. by prevention of new infections with these agents. The
results of this project are significant and are often sited by other. This research was the
first to demonstrate that chlorination alone or together with manual cleaning is
insufficient to affect contamination of water troughs with these enteropathogenic
microbes. These results indicate the urgent need to analyze the design of cattle water
supplies (tanks).
A multi-institutional epidemiologic project at Washington State University and the
University of California, entitled, “Clonal Dissemination of Antimicrobial Resistant
Campylobacter jejuni and E.coli”. These researchers have provided ground-breaking
research in the areas of resistance genes, resistant organisms and their existence and
movement through the environment. Their hypothesis is that antimicrobial resistance in
the enteric flora of cattle is clonally disseminated on a regional basis and stable over time.
This hypothesis predicts that a limited number of genetic strain types will account for
most frequently occuring antimicrobial resistance profiles. In conjunction with this
project Dr. Sischo at the University of California-Davis also has another research project
on Salmonella Typhimurim and Newport and emerging antimicrobial resistance. His
work has provided important spatial, geographic (GIS), and temporal data on the
movement of Salmonella on farm, in the environment, and in water. He was specifically
asked to present his research at a CDC conference on the emergence of multi-resistant
strains of Salmonella Newport.
An epidemiologic study on risk assessment is in progress. The scope of this project is to
cover the entire farm to fork continuum. The overall goal of this project is to identify
measurable risk factors in the production process and access the impact the risk factors
have on the occurrence of Salmonella and Campylobacter on broiler carcasses at the end
of processing. The research follows the birds from the breeder-hatchery, grow-out,
transportation from farm to plant, and processing. This research is unique in that it is
evaluating the risk factors from each segment so it can evaluate the effect of each
segment on the end product. The measurable risk factors in the production process and
their impact on the occurrence of Salmonella and Campylobacter on broiler carcasses at
the end of processing will help the poultry industry to comply with the HACCP
requirements.
