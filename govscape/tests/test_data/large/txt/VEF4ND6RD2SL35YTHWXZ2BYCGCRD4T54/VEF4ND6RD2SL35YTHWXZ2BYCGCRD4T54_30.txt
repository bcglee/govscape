research and technology transfer by: 1) strengthening the existing network of
epidemiologists, microbiologists, and other food safety specialists; 2) increasing
awareness about epidemiological approaches that integrate with other scientific
disciplines; and 3) building consensus about the significant food safety research
questions facing the U.S. and approaches to address those questions.
• Significant progress has been made in understanding the epidemiology of
Campylobacter and E.coli at the pre-harvest level. Some hypothesized
interventions or control methods have been shown no effect.
• A new sampling strategy has been developed to measure the prevalence of
Salmonella (and the effect of stress) on swine at the abbatoir.
Medium-term
• Because the nature of this research is large population studies, other Federal
agencies have been able to use our existing research studies to collect additional
data for their missions. For example, CVM (FDA) added funds to an existing
microbial contamination in produce study so that Enterococci samples could be
collected and tested for antimicrobial resistance.
• A novel sampling method (a rope device) for feedlot cattle allows the
determination of prevalence of Salmonella and E.coli in feedlots with minimum
stress and handling of the animals. This rope device, which is being patented, is
being used by other researchers and has revolutionized epidemiologic research at
the feedlot level.
• Two research projects have determined that vertical transmission of
Campylobacter in poultry does not occur. Therefore, interventions can be
targeted toward horizontal transmission of the organism.
• Research has determined that poultry litter plays a significant role in the
movement and transference of resistance integrons for Salmonella. This may help
understand further the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and help focus
certain intervention programs.
New Directions
Epidemiologic research will help provide the scientific approach to look at public health
issues as well as food safety. This would include, for example, the linkage of food safety
at the preharvest level to public health outcomes.
Food Safety-Coordinated Agriculture Project- This research program is not included
since it has started in 2004, but this large coordinated “network” is a natural extension
from the epidemiologic program. This CAP will contain over 17 universities and 40
researchers with expertise in microbiology and epidemiology in various food borne
organisms and diseases. The importance of this innovative program is that it will address
various needs for CSREES. This program will be able to respond quickly to emerging
new areas since there is flexibility in the grant. This program also has an education
component that will allow support of graduate students and young faculty. There is
