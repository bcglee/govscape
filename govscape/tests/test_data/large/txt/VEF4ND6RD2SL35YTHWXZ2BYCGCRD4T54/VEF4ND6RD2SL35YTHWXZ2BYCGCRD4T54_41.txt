Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR)
The SBIR program was developed to provide a source of funding to small businesses to
test the feasibility of concepts through a proof of concept process. These 1 year phase I
grants can be followed with longer phase II grants to actually develop the proven concept
into a product or process. The very nature of SBIR grants is to translate or apply
knowledge into commercial entities. While academic institutions frequently are
cooperators on SBIR projects, these grants are given directly to small businesses as a
means for them to develop into viable companies. The SBIR program has been a
significant source of funding for food safety projects. The projects described below are
representative examples of success stories with applications in food safety.
Success Stories
An SBIR Phase II grant was provided to XTRANA, Inc, in FY 2000, to develop a low
complexity genetic-based assay of high sensitivity and specificity for detection of L.
monocytogenes. XTRANA anticipated that following minimal enrichment times, the
assay will be run directly without the usual selective culture and subculture. Since the
assay would only detect viable organisms, it would provide information on the
effectiveness of microbial kill steps in processing, as well as sanitation of product and
environmental surfaces. This should permit more effective design of HACCP systems
and could reduce the frequency of outbreaks due to L. monocytogenes. XTRANA
indicated that it has attracted a potential strategic partner that is interested in
commercializing this assay. Their Phase II results indicate that their methods will detect
Listeria monocytogenes at high sensitivity and specificity with much quicker turnaround
that current methods in the market.
Current FSIS guidelines call for monitoring for the presence of various food-borne
pathogens, such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7, to improve the safety of
the food supply. In FY 1999, a Phase II SBIR grant was provided to Immunological
Associates of Denver, Inc. to develop a rapid detection method capable of being
performed on site at food processing plants in association with HACCP. It was expected
that the successful development of the proposed assay will result in safer food supply,
reduced incidence of food-borne infections, and avert large recalls. The method
integrates the steps of bacterial cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, amplification and
detection. The company identified several potential strategic partners that have expressed
interest in exploring possible phase III collaboration.
Maintaining fruits and vegetables safe to eat with good physical appearance is extremely
important to the produce industry. A phase I study successfully demonstrated that the use
of bubbleless O delivery could be used to effectively control microorganisms. A
3
delivery system developed by Compact Membrane System is the basis for this study. A
follow-up phase II proposal was funded in FY 2002.
