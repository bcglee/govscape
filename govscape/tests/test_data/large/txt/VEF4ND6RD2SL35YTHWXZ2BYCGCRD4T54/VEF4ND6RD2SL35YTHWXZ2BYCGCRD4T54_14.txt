budgets, it is more difficult to determine what funding is for food biosecurity versus food
safety, especially since many of the activities overlap. However, increases in funding
have been used for increased surveillance, inspections, and enforcement activities. Other
initiatives include the registration of food processing plants, and numerous rules and
guidelines.
Food safety research remains essential since many data gaps exist and food borne disease
is still a significant public health burden. Furthermore, the continual increase in the
number of multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria is of growing concern. There are
significant data gaps in the risk assessment models and, while there are several good
farming practice approaches, effective science-based on farm interventions are still
lacking. Consequently, research is needed to determine better interventions and better
control and prevention measures along the entire food safety continuum and tools need to
be developed that measure the effectiveness of these interventions at the farm, processor,
and public health levels. Furthermore, new infectious diseases have emerged (or re-
emerged) and antibiotic resistance has become a major issue in food safety. Most of
these new diseases are zoonotic and some are food- related (including BSE).
Another major initiative is in epidemiology with the availability of funding specifically
for epidemiologic research in food safety. There is an important need to develop data to
determine how food borne pathogens enter the food chain with the expectation that such
information will provide ways to break the transmission process. This requires the
inclusion of epidemiologic methods. With the initial increase in food safety research
funding in the late 1990â€™s, a new granting program was established in 1999 by the
CSREES. Epidemiologic Approaches for Food Safety provides epidemiologists and
microbiologists with an opportunity to obtain research funding. This program established
a new paradigm of mandated interdisciplinary research. Since 1999, this program has
provided over $23 million in funding for epidemiologic research.
CSREES also developed a mechanism to translate basic research into action via the
NIFSI. The goal of this Initiative is to link basic and applied research and to move the
outcomes of research funded through this program to the main stream. The Initiative also
is unique in that it also mandates a link to educational and outreach activities, which
include education of producers and consumers. Consequently, NIFSI is the applied wing
of the food safety portfolio.
In addition to the food safety programs within CSREES, other agency programs are
charged to improve food safety. In particular, scientists studying microbes that cause
food borne illnesses now are aided in their investigations because of the availability of
genome sequences of food borne pathogens. Some of this sequence data has been
obtained through research derived from other CSREES supported research programs
(Animal Health and Well-Being and Microbial Genomics). The remainder is from NIH,
DOE, NSF, other non profit organizations, as well as numerous international sources.
The genome sequences are being used to develop a spectrum of outcomes from new,
rapid diagnostic tests for food borne pathogens, to the development of animal vaccines to
break the transmission cycle of food borne pathogens in animals.
