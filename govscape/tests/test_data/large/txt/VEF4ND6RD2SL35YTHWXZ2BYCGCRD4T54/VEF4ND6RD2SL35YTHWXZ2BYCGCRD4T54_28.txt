NRI Food Safety Program- 32.1: Epidemiologic Approaches for Food Safety
Overview- Missions and Goals
The mission of the CSREES NRI Epidemiologic Approaches for Food Safety is to
enhance food safety by providing the opportunity for large scale population-based studies
including studies at the farm level. It also is to foster research that will increase our
understanding of the epidemiology of food borne pathogens, identify risk factors, and
provide science-based analysis of interventions and control strategies. Projects funded
through this initiative must be multidisciplinary.
Situation- Program Objectives
The program’s objective is to enhance the understanding of the multiple factors involved
in food safety and provide the science-based data for policy decisions. Significant gaps
exist in the knowledge base for food safety and the risk factors involved in the entire
continuum of food production, from farm to table. Epidemiologic studies of pre- and
post-harvest areas are vital to identify and characterize pathogenic organisms, including
their sources and reservoirs; and to understand the transmission of the pathogen along the
entire continuum. The identification of risk factors for exposure to and infection by these
pathogens can be accomplished by several different epidemiologic research
methodologies. These methodologies can be applied at any stage of food production.
Environmental and ecological data are needed to increase our understanding of disease-
causing microorganisms, their products, and naturally occurring contaminants in meats,
poultry, seafood, and fresh fruits and vegetables. Studies that elucidate these data or
information, or provide a "value of information" analysis, can provide important
information on where research is needed and could be useful for risk assessments.
The current emphasis of this program is any population-based epidemiologic study that
involves identifying risk factors and evaluating strategies to reduce food borne
contamination, whether pre- or post- harvest. It also involves the identification of
potential sites of contamination from farm to fork; the development of optimal sampling
strategies; and the development of outcome measures for the impact of intervention or
management strategies.
Outputs
Between Fiscal years 1999 and 20003, The Epidemiologic Approaches for Food Safety
program has funded 34 proposals for a little over $23.5 million. Highlights from these
grants are:
• Results from the study on microbial contamination of produce will be relevant for
resolving the current embargo on the importation of Mexican cantaloupe into the
U.S.
• Results from a study of Campylobacter suggest that effective control of
Campylobacter in poultry should use multiple approaches (including
