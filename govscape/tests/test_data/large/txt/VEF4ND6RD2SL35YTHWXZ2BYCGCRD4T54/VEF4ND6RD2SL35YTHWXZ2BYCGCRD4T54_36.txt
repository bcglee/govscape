Outputs
Since its inception in Fiscal Year 2000, NIFSI has awarded more than 160 competitive
grants. Grants are awarded for up to 4 years, with the average grant funded at $500,000.
On-going integrated activities described in annual CRIS reports are widely varied and
include:
• Conducting workshops, seminars, conferences, national and international
meetings
• Developing interactive websites that provide answers to commonly-asked
consumer food safety questions
• Curriculum and course development for education and training of a variety of
food safety audiences
• Training of migrant farm workers across the U.S. using modified GAPS (Good
• Agricultural Practices) guidelines
• HACCP training and education for meat and poultry processors
• HACCP model development for fruit and vegetable growers
Outcomes
Federal data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have indicated that
there has been a decrease in food borne illness incidence over the past 7-8 years. NIFSI
has contributed to this overall decrease in the incidence of food borne illness its unique
and innovative an integrated approaches that brings together the resources of the
government, universities, and the food industry to solve complex food safety problems.
New Directions
Input from stakeholders is solicited annually ensuring that the ever evolving needs of
stakeholders are met. As emerging issues and other new program priorities are identified
(or as existing priorities are modified), there is a subsequent expansion of the
contemporary knowledge base for food safety, and a strengthening of overall food safety
programs within CSREES and USDA.
Success Stories
Successful development of strategies aimed at controlling this E. coli O157:H7 depend
on coordinated efforts from a wide cross-section of scientists and researchers. Using
conference grant funds researchers at the University of Nebraska sponsored a Governor’s
Conference on Ensuring Meat Safety: E. coli O157:H7 Progress and Challenges. The
conference brought together national and international experts involved in basic and
applied research, extension educators, and industry representatives. Although recent
research progress was detailed, the overwhelming emphasis was placed on addressing
future challenges and on integrating the full spectrum of the E. coli problem, from farm
to table. Invited speakers included veterinary scientists, medical researchers, geneticists,
and applied food scientists. Extension specialists and food industry research directors
