for the differences in heat resistance between spores of C. perfringens isolates carrying
chromosomal versus plasmid enterotoxin (CPE) genes. These studies will provide
important insights into the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens isolates and
may improve our abilities to prevent C. perfringens type A food poisoning, which
currently affects over 600,000 Americans per year.
Another example of how young scientists are supported by NRI funding is demonstrated
by Dr. Sangwei Lu, who received a New Investigator Award from the NRI Food Safety
Program in Fiscal Year 2003 for her proposal, “Genetic Determinants of Resistance of
Salmonella Enteritidis to Chicken Egg Albumen.” The goal of her research is to
determine how S. enteritidis, a major food borne pathogen, is able to survive and persist
in eggs. Dr. Lu had previously served as a postdoctoral associate in an NRI-funded grant
to Dr. L. Riley at the University of California, Berkeley entitled “Resistance of
Salmonella Enteriditis to the Antimicrobial Stress of Egg Albumen.” In the original
study, the researchers established an in vitro assay of bacterial survival in egg albumen
and identified a novel mechanism of bactericidal activity of egg albumen, and a gene,
yafD, that is necessary for S. enteritidis to survive in egg albumen. Dr. Lu is now
continuing this work to screen a transposon mutant library to systematically identify
genes necessary for S. enteritidis to survive in egg albumen and characterize the
mechanisms of resistance mediated by these genes.
Jan Sargeant and colleagues at Kansas State University have received CSREES-funded
Special Grants, an NRI Food Safety grant and an NRI Epidemiological Approaches for
Food Safety grant. This research group is working on effective strategies to control E.
coli O157:H7 in feedlot cattle. They have studied the distributional patterns of E. coli
O157:H7 in agricultural range environments and found that persistent subtypes were
found in different types and groups of cattle, in natural free-flowing water and in wildlife
sources. They have also studied management practices related to fecal shedding of E.
coli O157:H7 in feedlot cattle and found that preventing fecal contamination of water
tanks and controlling vermin and house flies in cattle pens may reduce fecal shedding of
this organism.
Dr. Don White of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana has been active in
breeding maize for resistance to Fusarium spp and other fungi associated with mycotoxin
production in grain. A proposal was funded in FY 2003 to support the identification of
maize germplasm with practical levels of resistance to F. moniliforme, F. proliferatum
and related fusaria. The primary objective of the project is to reduce or eliminate
fumonisins in maize grain such that maize-based food products contain little or no
fumonisin. This task was partially accomplished through the identification of molecular
markers associated with resistance genes in a variety of maize inbreds. To date, four
resistant inbreds with particular promise have been identified and evaluated in the field
for resistance to Fusarium ear rot and fumonisin levels in grain at three different
locations (North Carolina, Illinois and Indiana). Inbred lines CG1, TBA76125, GE440
and FR1064 have all been demonstrated to result in significantly lower levels of
fumonisin in maize grain. All of these genotypes are undergoing molecular marker
analysis and generation means analysis to aid in the localization of these resistance loci to
