• Develop information on the ecology of human pathogens and understanding
pathways to contaminate food. Focus on Listeria, E.coli 0157:H7, Salmonella ,
and campylobacter .
• Develop tests to detect pathogens that can be used by producers, processors, and
regulatory agencies, such as the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) and the
Food and Drug Administration.
• Develop new on-farm and processing systems and practices to reduce pathogen
contamination.
• Work with Federal food safety agency partners, FSIS and the Food and Drug
Administration, to evaluate available food borne illness data and develop more
accurate measures on the effectiveness of regulatory strategies in reducing
preventable food borne illness.
• Develop scientific information and risk assessment models, in cooperation with
the Food Safety mission area, that permit regulatory agencies to develop risk
assessments for production, processing, and distributions systems
• Collect and disseminate science based information on chemical usage during the
production and processing of food
• Provide the general public with food safety and biosecurity information and
education through expanded outreach programs that address all aspects of food
safety and mitigation strategies.
• Assist in developing the next generation of research scientists, educators, and
technicians in the food and agricultural sciences.
• Design and develop intervention strategies that will aid regulatory agencies,
including FSIS, in establishing the basis for regulations under Hazard Analysis
and Critical Control Point (HACCP).
Overview of the Nation’s Food Safety Issues
While the food supply in the United States is one of the safest in the world, the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) estimates that 76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are
hospitalized, and 5,000 Americans die each year from food borne illness. Preventing
food borne illnesses and death remains a major public health challenge. The nation’s
food system(s) are large and highly complex, which increases the difficulty in addressing
this societal issue. It also mandates government involvement.
In 1997 in response to increased concerns about food borne illnesses, President Clinton
introduced the Food Safety Initiative (FSI). The initial focus and goal of FSI was to
reduce the number of illnesses caused by microbial contamination of food and water.
The responsibilities for different aspects of food safety are necessarily shared among
various government agencies. Consequently, there is a need for close coordination of
activities. The initiative stimulated the formation of numerous task forces, committees,
initiatives, and funding incentives over the following years. Some of the actions included
major reports and recommendations on food safety in the U.S. such as “Food Safety from
Farm to Table: A National Food Safety Initiative- A Report to the President, a report of
the National Academy's findings “Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption”,
and the Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and
