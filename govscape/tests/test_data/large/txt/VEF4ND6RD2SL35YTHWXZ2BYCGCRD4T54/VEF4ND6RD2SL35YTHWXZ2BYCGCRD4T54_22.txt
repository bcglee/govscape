NRI Food Safety Program (32.0)
Overview – Mission and Goals:
The 32.0 Food Safety Program seeks to enhance the knowledge of mechanisms of food
borne illness from the standpoint of both basic and applied research efforts with the goal
of developing risk mitigation measures. This includes, but is not limited to,
investigations of vector-based transmission of pathogens, toxins and contaminants;
identification of critical control points in food production and processing; development of
novel vaccines to preclude pathogen colonization; molecular and biochemical approaches
to understanding the genetic and physiological mechanisms influencing pathogen
virulence; model development to predict aspects of food production and processing
wherein mitigation will be most effective; socioeconomic factors affecting food safety;
and genetic modification of crops to mitigate toxin producing microorganisms.
Situation -- Program Objectives:
The overall objective of the Food Safety Program (32.0) is to reduce the incidence and
frequency of food-borne illness through identification and development of mitigation
measures. The mechanisms that lead to a reduction in food-borne illness may consist of
what is considered as basic research into mechanisms of pathogen virulence, genetic
variance in pathogen populations, and physiological mechanisms influencing toxin
production among other areas. Applied research also is funded under this program and
may consist of pre-harvest or post-harvest investigations into measures that will directly
modify the production or processing environment leading to a reduction in colonization
or survival of food-associated microorganisms. Mitigation measures investigated through
this program may be biological, chemical, physical or may rely on a change in behavior
or food handling methods.
In addition to colonization of foods with microbial contaminants, chemical contaminants
are also considered as food safety issues and research into reducing this contamination
may be funded under the 32.0 RFA. This includes pesticidal chemicals wherein residues
exceed EPA-determined levels for a particular pesticide on a specific commodity, but
may also include inadvertent chemical contaminants that may be of environmental origin
or as a result of human actions.
Outputs
Between Fiscal Years 1999 and 2003 the NRI Food Safety Program provided grants for
more than 136 separate projects. Highlights from these grants are presented below.
• Partial financial support was provided for 7 national workshops or conferences.
Examples include the 2001 Symposia on Microbial Food borne Hazards; the
American Academy of Microbiology colloquium, Antibiotic Resistance and the
Role of Antimicrobials in Agriculture: A Critical Scientific Assessment, in 2001;
and the 2003 Mycotoxins and Phycotoxins Gordon Conference.
