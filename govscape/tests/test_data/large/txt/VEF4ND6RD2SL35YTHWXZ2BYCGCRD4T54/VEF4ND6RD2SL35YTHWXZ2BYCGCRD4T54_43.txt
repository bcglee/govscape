to develop educational and informational materials on food safety for rural residents in
Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama, and (4) to educate members of selected ethnic
groups and rural residents on important food safety issues. Through participating in this
project, students' research at Tennessee State University will be enhanced. In addition to
learning how to conduct research, students will be encouraged to write scientific papers
for presentation at national and/or regional conferences. Faculty from Tennessee State
University will be able to strengthen their research capacity in food safety research. The
collaborative initiatives will expose the agency to the 1890 academic and research
programs and assist the University train students for future workforce needs.
