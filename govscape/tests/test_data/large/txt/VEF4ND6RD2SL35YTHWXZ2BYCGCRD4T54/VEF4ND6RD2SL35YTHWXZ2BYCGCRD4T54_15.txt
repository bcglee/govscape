In the April 30, 2004 issue of Morbity and Mortality Weekly Report, it was stated that
“During 1996--2003, the estimated incidence of Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E.
coli O157, Salmonella, and Yersinia infections declined substantially. The decline in
Campylobacter and E. coli O157 infections demonstrates that meeting the 2010 national
health objectives of 12.3 and 1.0 illnesses per 100,000 persons, respectively is likely.
Although the incidence of Salmonella infection has declined, it remains above its
objective, and among the five most common Salmonella serotypes, only S. Typhimurium
demonstrated a sustained decline in incidence.” These results indicate that the fruits of
the multi-pronged attack to improve the safety of foods are working. In the following
sections information and data will be provided that describes the breadth and depth of the
CSREES programs, the success stories, and their impacts. The approach taken in this
report is to describe the individual programs and to show how the various programs
interact with each other as well as other governmental and stakeholder programs. As
stated previously, the individual programs are highly interactive and interdependent. The
approach taken in this report is to simply the review.
The Problem Areas (PA) that are considered part of the food safety portfolio include PA
711 (Ensure food products free of harmful chemicals, including residues from
agricultural and other sources) and 712 (Protect food from contamination by pathogenic
microorganisms, parasites, and naturally occurring toxins). Because PA 711 is a small
component of the food safety portfolio, we elected to merge the two PAs into a single
report. Furthermore, it was felt that both PAs represent important food safety concerns
that are interrelated. For the information below describing the food safety programs, we
elected to describe the NRI programs (32.0 and 32.1), the NIFSI, and special grants/SBIR
grants individually.
Inputs
The major type of input data is the number of projects funded, the total dollars provided,
and the number of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows supported through
CSREES funds within the Food Safety objective. The data presented in the following
series of graphs and tables represent inputs from the CRIS database and is sorted by
Subject of Information (SOI) categories. To aid in the interpretation of the data we
elected to present only the top 5 of 10 SOI’s since these represent that greatest percentage
of fund allocation. The number of trainees supported with CSREES funds from
competitive grants only includes NRI-based funds.
