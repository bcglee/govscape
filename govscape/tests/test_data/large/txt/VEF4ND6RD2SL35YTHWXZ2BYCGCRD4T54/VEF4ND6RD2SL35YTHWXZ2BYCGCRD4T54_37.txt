also addressed conference attendees from the university and industry perspectives. The
conference attracted over 200 attendees. New research strategies emerged and innovative
collaborations were developed as a result of bringing together such a diverse group of
individuals.
Over the past several years, the NIFSI has awarded over $800,000 to investigators
focusing on food biosecurity issues. For example, at the University of Georgia,
investigators are assessing current Good Agricultural Practices and HAACP programs
used by produce growers to study points of vulnerability to intentional contamination.
Investigators are assessing whether deliberate contamination of produce with food bore
pathogens remains with the produce after harvest. Their results will be incorporated into
a training curriculum for produce industry personnel. The curriculum will be used as a
model across the U.S. and its territories for similar programs and audiences. In addition,
investigators at New Mexico State University are developing a distance education
program in food biosecurity for minority farmers. Their goal is to help farmers assess
their potential risks, while adopting practices that reduce their risk for food safety threats,
both intentional and unintentional. Assessment tools have been developed and are
currently being tested.
Prediction of hazards is at the heart of food safety. If researchers could predict the
likelihood of an unsafe condition during food processing, storage, or distribution, they
could then look for ways to prevent such contamination before it happens. Such
prediction, however, is difficult due to tremendous variation in types of food, how it is
handled and processed, transported, stored, prepared, etc. A rational, comprehensive,
quantitative, science-based, and easy-to-use prediction tool would go a long way toward
reducing intentional and/or unintentional food hazards. NIFSI has funded a grant that
uses advances in engineering and computer simulation to develop a tool for researchers,
educators, and Extension professionals that will allow easy and accurate prediction of
unsafe food hazards. The grant enables researchers at Cornell University to first develop
computer simulations of food processes that are as close as possible to real-life situations.
Growth of harmful bacteria, or formation of harmful chemicals due to the cooking
process, is then estimated inside this simulation software. To do this, engineering
simulation software needs to be linked with food and microbial properties that have been
developed by different universities and government laboratories. This multi-disciplinary,
multi-institutional, and multi-country (US and the UK) collaboration greatly enhances the
capacity of the software. Researchers anticipate that this quantitative tool will allow
decision-making and problem-solving that will significantly enhance food safety
resources and outreach programs.
Special grants
Special grants are unique in the CSREES Food Safety research portfolio. These grants
are legislative mandates that are usually negotiated between the grantee and Congress.
Special Research Grants are awarded on a discretionary basis as well as through the use
of competitive scientific peer and merit review processes. The grants tend to be applied
projects that address specific problems. These projects frequently relate to regional
