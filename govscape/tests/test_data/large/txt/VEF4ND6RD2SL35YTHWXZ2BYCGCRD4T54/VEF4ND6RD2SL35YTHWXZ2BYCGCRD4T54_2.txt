information that have the potential to challenge our thinking and study of food safety
(e.g. use of geographic information systems tracking S. enterica and antibiotic resistance
in the environment, analysis of closed systems in studying the epidemiology of C. jejuni
in Iceland, and the development of “ropes” to track E. coli O157:H7 in beef feedlots).
While these are but a few examples of impacts, we believe that the evidence provided in
this report, which represents the entire food safety portfolio, demonstrate the food safety
programs operate at a high level. Program performance has been excellent and the quality
of the work has been outstanding. However, we believe that the most significant aspect of
the portfolio is the data that demonstrates the performance of the funded work has led to
significant impacts in the food safety system. This has led to an improvement in the
safety of the foods produced through the US agricultural systems. The work has led to a
spectrum of discoveries that range from that of a basic understanding of the principles of
food safety through to the development of interventions, to tools for the detection of
adulterants in foods. These accomplishments are remarkable and are strong indicators of
success of the Food Safety program.
