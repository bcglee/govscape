including salmonella, E.coli, etc. The funded research also covers all food and animal
issues, including emerging issues in sea food and produces, as well as sources of food-
borne diseases.
Portfolio Ability to Remain Focused on Critical Needs of the Nation
The portfolio has received inputs from stakeholders, individuals, the academia, and other
agencies. The NPLs in the portfolio are active on national and international food safety
committees. They regularly attend meetings of these committees to discuss and establish
national needs.
Identification of Emerging Issues Relevant to the Portfolio
The NPLs in the portfolio stay active on food safety national committees, regularly
reviewing the literature on emerging issues, interacting with CDCP and the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).
Integration of CSREES Education, Research, and Extension Efforts in the Portfolio
The portfolio integrates research, education, and extension in its grant program that
compliments the other two NRI research programs.
Multidisciplinary Balance of the Portfolio
The portfolio NPLs are involved with other food scientists, animal health specialists,
epidemiologists, microbiologists, biologists, and food safety specialists in the extension
network. This is particularly in the NRI Food Safety Program (32.1), Epidemiological
Approaches to Food Safety.
Quality
Significance of Portfolio Outputs and Findings
Investment in the food safety research program has made it possible for the portfolio to
provide information and make recommendations to regulatory agencies for changes in
food safety practices. For example, chickens contaminated with Campylobacter, when
frozen, will reduce the risk to consumers. This practice has been adopted by several
countries in the world.
Stakeholder/Constituents Assessment of Portfolio
The portfolio regularly holds multiple stakeholder meetings to solicit priorities.
Simultaneously, the NPLs hold annual meetings to exchange information with FDA and
other Federal agencies.
Alignment of Portfolio Projects with Current State of Science-based Knowledge and
Previous Work
The projects funded by the Food Safety portfolio reflect the recommendations recently
made by the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of
Microbiology.
