● A consortium of approximately 20 Federal agencies met to solicit the collective and
individual needs of each agency in the area of risk assessment.
● A joint CSREES/ARS stakeholder workshop held in November of 2001:
In a format similar to a public listening session, university, industry, consumer, and
federal partners presented their food safety and animal agriculture priorities, and worked
to develop overall program priorities. The workshop highlighted complementary
research between CSREES and Agricultural Research Services (ARS).
● NASULGC recommendations provided in a published report to USDA:
Recommendations from the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant
Colleges (NASULGC) were provided in a report published in 2001 entitled “A Science
Roadmap for Agriculture.” Recommendations provided guidance for food safety
program priorities in CSREES.
● A CSREES-sponsored interagency brainstorming session held in August of 2002:
Federal stakeholders from Food Safety Inspection Services (FSIS), Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and Agricultural Marketing Services (AMS) participated in a
planning activity intended to help guide priority-setting for integrated food safety
programs in CSREES. Federal stakeholders provided agency updates, and discussed areas
where each agency could work together to strengthen overall food safety programs
throughout the government.
● A Stakeholder Listening Session on Food Safety Research Priorities:
CSREES and ARS took the lead in hosting a national stakeholder session in June 2003
for the Office of the Research, Economics, and Education (REE) Under Secretary. The
session was held in Denver, Colorado. Industry, university, consumer, and federal
stakeholders ranked their top 5 food safety research priorities. The input that was
gathered at this session was compiled and summarized in a report published by USDA
entitled, “The USDA Food Safety Research Agenda for 2004-08.”
Overview of CSREES Food Safety Portfolio Funding and Priorities
Overview: Current Funding and priorities within CSREES: Research, education, and
extension programs are funded by CSREES through several programs: The National
Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program, The Integrated Food Safety Program,
Special Grants, grants from SBIR, and Hatch and other formula funds. In the 5 years
covered by this review, over $108 million have been provided through CSREES for food
safety research. In addition, funds secured through CSREES have been used to leverage
other funding opportunities and vice versa. Funding for Food safety remains steady
although newer priorities have emerged since the bioterrorism act. In the Federal
