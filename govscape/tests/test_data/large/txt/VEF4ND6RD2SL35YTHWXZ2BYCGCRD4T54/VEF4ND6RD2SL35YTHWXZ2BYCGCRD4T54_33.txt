CSREES Strategic Goal 3: Enhance Protection and Safety of the Nationâ€™s Agriculture and Food Supply
CSREESObjective 3.1: Reduce the Incidence of Food borne Illnesses and Contaminants through Science Based
Knowledge and Education

NRI Food Safety Program (32.1):Epidemiological Approaches for Food Safety
Accomplishments
Funding Sources
Found that vertical transmission is
not a major mode of contamination
by Campylobacter on poultry farms
Found that Campylobacter is highly
mutable after exposure to fluoroquinolone
antibiotics used in chickens
Found that freezing chickens will eliminate
viable Campylobacter from the carcass.
Led to a 70% decrease in domestically
acquired infections
Quantified the relations between
management practices that foster the
shedding of E.Coliand feedlot cattle
CSREES performance. Found that risk factors
identified are not amenable to mitigation
Demonstrated that chlorination alone or
together with manual cleaning is
insufficient to affect contamination of
Other Federal water troughs with enteropathogenic
microbes.
Agencies
Assessed innovative rope device for
detection of E.Coliin feedlot cattle that
would lower stress and handling. This
method has proven useful for other
pathogens and is being patented
Additional Work Needed
Need to use epidemiological research Need to design water cattle supplies Need to establish the CAP research
to link food safety at the preharvest (tanks) less susceptible to program, containing over 17 universities
level to public health outcomes contamination with enteropathogenic and 4 0 expert researchers, to respond
bacteria quickly to emerging issues and to
facilitate collaborative projects
