SECTION IV: Summary and Conclusions
_______________________________________________________
The intent of this report was to provide reviewers with an objective view of the CSREES
Food Safety Program. The data presented in this report demonstrate a high degree of
research and educational activities supported through the various funding mechanisms of
CSREES. More importantly, as can seen in the Success Stories, the Food Safety
programs have wisely selected projects for funding and these projects have made an
impact in understanding the science behind food safety and have contributed to the
reduction in food borne illnesses. While we elected to describe the funding avenues
separately, we want to stress that the programs are interactive. They are not stand-alone
programs and build upon each other’s stakeholder and user base.
In considering the outcomes from the Food Safety program as described in this report, we
want to emphasize the significance of the outcomes as they relate to federal investment.
Several projects including those related to actual interventions (e.g. product irradiation
guidelines, diagnostic assays, and analysis of the benefits of good agricultural practices
on food safety) demonstrate the strong commitments of the programs to the development
of real world applications. As well, several studies have resulted in basic science
information that have the potential to challenge our thinking and study of food safety
(e.g. use of geographic information systems tracking S. enterica and antibiotic resistance
in the environment, analysis of closed systems in studying the epidemiology of C. jejuni
in Iceland, and the development of “ropes” to track E. coli O157:H7 in beef feedlots).
While these are but a few examples of impacts, we believe that the evidence provided in
this report, which represents the entire food safety portfolio, demonstrate the food safety
programs operate at a high level. Program performance has been excellent and the quality
of the work has been outstanding. However, we believe that the most significant aspect of
the portfolio is the data that demonstrates the performance of the funded work has led to
significant impacts in the food safety system. This has led to an improvement in the
safety of the foods produced through the US agricultural systems. The work has led to a
spectrum of discoveries that range from that of a basic understanding of the principles of
food safety through to the development of interventions, to tools for the detection of
adulterants in foods. These accomplishments are remarkable and are strong indicators of
success of the Food Safety program.
To assist the panel in assessing the Food Safety portfolio using the three research
investment criteria of relevance, quality, and performance, the following summary is
offered:
