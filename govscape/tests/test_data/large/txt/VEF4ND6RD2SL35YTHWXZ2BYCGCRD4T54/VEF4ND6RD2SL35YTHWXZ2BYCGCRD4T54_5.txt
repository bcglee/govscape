SECTION II -- Portfolio Description
This self-study report was developed by the Plant and Animal Sciences (PAS) unit,
Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES), United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA). It is submitted to the Portfolio Review Panel, which
is convened by the CSREES Administrator, in order to assess the effectiveness of the
NRE unit as it leads efforts to address national problems and/or issues related food safety
and biosecurity. The report covers a wide variety of programs conducted from 1999â€“
2003 that are related to CSREES Strategic Goal 3: and Objective 3.1: Reduce the
Incidence of Food borne Illnesses Through Science-Based Knowledge and Education.
This self-study is presented in two volumes. Volume One is a description of the portfolio
and its programs. The second volume is Evidentiary Materials that are organized in a
separate notebook. The notebook has been tabbed to provide overview materials followed
by materials pertinent to each of the Food Safety programs. The following two Problem
Areas (PA) are covered in this portfolio. However, since they are closely related, they
are merged in the portfolio description:
PA 711. Ensure food products free of harmful chemical, including residues from
agricultural and other sources.
PA 712. Protect food from contamination by pathogenic microorganisms, parasites, and
naturally occurring toxins.
The Problem Area discussion is composed of research, education, and extension activities
across various units within CSREES. A specific program, often conducted by a single
program unit or even a single National Program Leader (NPL), may address several
Problem Areas and several objectives of the CSREES Strategic Plan. Descriptions of
these areas are compressed and do not cover all the activities within a portfolio.
Additional information can be found in the Evidentiary Materials that will be available at
CSREES review. The CSREES website (http://www.csrees.usda.gov) also contains
information on the programs covered under this portfolio.
For the Nation to have affordable and safe food, the food system must be protected at
each step from production to consumption. The production and distribution system for
food in the United States is diverse, extensive, and easily accessible. This open system is
vulnerable to introduction of pathogens and toxins through natural processes, global
commerce, and by intentional means. Crop and livestock production systems must be
protected from the ravages of diseases whether domestic or exotic. The food supply must
be protected during production, processing, and preparation from contamination by
pathogens and toxins that cause disease in humans.
