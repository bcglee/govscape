Appropriate Methodology of funded Portfolio Projects
The projects funded by the portfolio, such as the NRI Food Safety Program (32.1), the
national integrated food safety program, etc. were rigorously reviewed by individual
experts and Peer Review Panels and ad hoc review panels for scientific merit, innovation,
impact, national significance, and potential for success. Their proposed research
methodologies have met approval of expert panels and ad hoc review panels.
Performance
Portfolio Productivity
The projects funded under the Food Safety portfolio have generated numerous scientific
publications, book chapters, etc., and made significant expansion of science programs at
national meetings. They have also contributed to potential action for reducing food-
borne disease.
Portfolio Completeness
The Food Safety portfolio covers the entire spectrum of food production chain “from
farm to table” in all three areas of research, education, and extension.
Portfolio Timeliness
The portfolio does not only focus its research activities on current issues of food-borne
disease. It is, indeed, future oriented looking at viral causes of food-borne diseases. For
example, it focused research activities on BSC before it occurred in the US.
