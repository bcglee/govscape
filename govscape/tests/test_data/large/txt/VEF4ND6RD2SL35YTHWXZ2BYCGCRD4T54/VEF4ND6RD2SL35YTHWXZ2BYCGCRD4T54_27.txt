CSREES Strategic Goal 3: Enhance Protection and Safety of the Nationâ€™s Agriculture and Food Supply
CSREESObjective 3.1: Reduce the Incidence of Food borne Illnesses and Contaminants through Science Based
Knowledge and Education

Funding Sources
Accomplishments
Established an in vitro assay of
bacterial survival, identified a novel
mechanism of bactericidal activity,
and a gene, yafD, that is necessary
for S. enteritidisto survive in egg
albumen
Found that persistent subtypes of
E.Coli0157:H7 were found in different
types and groups of cattle in natural
free-flowing water and in wildlife
sources
Found that preventing fecal contamination
of water tanks and
CSREES controlling vermin and house flies in
cattle pens may reduce fecal shedding
in feedlot cattle.
Identified molecular markers associated
Other Federal with resistance genes in a variety of
maize inbreeds
Agencies
Demonstrated that inbred lines CG1,
TBA76125, GE440, and FR1064 result
in significantly lower levels of fumonisin
in maize grain
Additional Work Needed
Need further research on bacterial- Need better science-based Need risk assessment for products of
based foodborne illness mitigation information on prionsand related biotechnology
spongiform encephalopathies,
Need funding and emphasis to be chemical components of foods, and
placed on enteric viruses mycotoxins
