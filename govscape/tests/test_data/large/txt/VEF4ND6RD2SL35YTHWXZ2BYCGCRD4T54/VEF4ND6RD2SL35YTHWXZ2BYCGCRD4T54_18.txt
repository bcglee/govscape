SECTION III – FOOD SAFETY PROGRAMS
Introduction to NRI and NIFSI
CSREES shapes the future of food safety through research, education, and extension.
These three components are crucial in allowing food safety researchers, educators, and
communicators to move from theory, to data gathering, to data analysis, to testing, to
program development, to implementation, and, finally, to evaluation. This
comprehensive approach provides the basis for an overall “integrated” food safety
program. Food safety program components within CSREES are addressed through two
of the Agency’s flagship competitive grant programs –NIFSI and the NRI (Sections 32.0
and 32.1). While NRI focuses on developing new knowledge, NIFSI focuses on applying
new knowledge. Thus, both programs complement each other, rather than being
duplicative. Basic research generated through NRI provides baseline data to support the
development of NIFSI’s educational interventions. In addition, NRI basic research will
provide new detection methods, prevalence data, or identification of new risk factors that
can then be integrated into education or extension programs funded through NIFSI. This
ensures that research results are disseminated to appropriate end-users.
