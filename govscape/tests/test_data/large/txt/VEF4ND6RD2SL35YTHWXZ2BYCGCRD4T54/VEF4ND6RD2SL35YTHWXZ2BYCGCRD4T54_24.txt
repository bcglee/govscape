Researchers at Texas Technical University have demonstrated that plant tissues besides
green leafy vegetation may contribute to total perchlorate exposure among humans and
livestock. Concern over animal exposure to perchlorate has largely centered on drinking
water. This research highlights the need to further consider plant ingestion as an
exposure route. In addition, other plant tissues besides green leafy vegetation may also
contribute to total perchlorate exposure among humans and livestock. These data
demonstrate that food items may be a significant source of perchlorate exposure in
humans and livestock, but exposure via food may not produce the same degree of effect
as exposure via drinking water. The EPA is using this data in revising standards for
human perchlorate exposure. Publications resulting from this NRI-funded research
include:
Medium-term outcomes
The April 2004 issue of CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report states that the
incidence of food borne illnesses is in decline. This is the result of a multi-agency, multi-
prolonged approach to enhance microbial contamination of food and services as an
indicator that these programs are working.
New Directions
Current program funding is centered on bacterial-based food borne illness mitigation.
These proposals reflect the predominance of bacterially-mediated food safety issues
confronting producers and processors. Antibiotic resistance also has been a major area of
research funded by this program. Despite significant advances from these projects, it is
likely that the major food borne illnesses will continue and increases in antibiotic
resistant will occur. Consequently, these areas will remain important themes in our food
safety funding portfolio. In addition to these food safety concerns, other research areas
will continue to evolve and be in need of financial support to address food safety issues.
While bacterial pathogens represent the area garnering the largest amount of funding,
enteric viruses represent the largest cause of food borne illnesses and emphasis needs to
be placed on this area. Other areas that may need better science-based information
include prions and related spongiform encephalopathies. Studies on chemical
contaminants of foods (e.g., dioxins, perchlorate, pesticide residues), mycotoxins, and
risk assessments needed for products of biotechnology (e.g., toxicology and allergenicity
of transgenic proteins) also need to be considered.
Success Stories
One of the impacts of the NRI competitive grants programs is the support of new
scientists who are beginning their careers in the area of food safety. For example,
Muhfahzur Sarker of Oregon State University received the Presidential Early Career
Award in Science and Engineering for his NRI-funded project “The Molecular Basis for
Clostridium perfringens Spore Heat Resistance.” Dr. Sarker received this award because
his proposal was considered to be the best proposal from a New Investigator funded by
the NRI in Fiscal Year 2002. The goal of this project is to determine the molecular basis
