The goal of this portfolio review is to critically evaluate the directions and successes of
the CSREES food safety programs. The parameters driving the program include the
important situations, inputs, outputs, and outcomes (short, medium, and long term) are
listed in the portfolio Logic Models. The food safety programs are conceptualized in the
first logic model. The logic model provides a high level illustration and analysis of the
food safety strategy. The program descriptions that follow are geared to the logic model
organization. In this document, each type of program in the food safety portfolio is
separately highlighted: NRI 32.0, NRI 32.1, NIFSI, Special Grants, and SBIR grants. In
addition to the comprehensive food safety logic model, separate logic models are shown
for the NRI programs, NIFSI, and a combined NRI-NIFSI model. The combined NRI-
NIFSI logic model is presented as an example that recognizes that none of the food safety
programs are free standing and that strategic goals and activities are inherently tied to
each other. It is clear that the separate programs are components of a cohesive and well
coordinated research and education system. In the following portfolio descriptions, when
necessary, aggregate data are presented. In other situations, the individual programs,
particularly their successes, are individually showcased. It is important to note that while
the individual programs are described separately in this portfolio review document, this
separation is meant to simplify the review process. It is recognized that this perspective
is a somewhat artificial view of the portfolio.
An additional graphical representations of the food safety programs are shown in a
“honey comb” illustration. The illustration has been developed to graphically present the
relationship between functions within the program, and their relationship to other
programs within and outside of CSREES.
