Executive Summary
The portfolio review document for the Food Safety Program of Cooperative State
Research, Education, and Extension Services (CSREES) was developed as a means to
effectively review the overall effectiveness and impact of the program. The overall goal
of the program is to improve the safety of the nation’s food supply. The data supplied in
this self study document, primarily represented in the numerous Success Stories, provide
strong evidence that the program has relevance, quality, and performance, that it is
working as designed, and that it is having a significant impact on improving the US food
systems. Reference is made, in several places in the document, to data from the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) indicating that the incidence of food borne illnesses is
decreasing. This overall improvement in public health is due to many federal programs
including the CSREES Food Safety program. Food safety is a partnership of numerous
agencies and evidence is provided that the CSREES Food Safety team is effective in its
interactions with other agencies and is having a positive effect on improving the safety of
food.
This report is comprised of two major sections. The first section describes the mission
and goals of CSREES and cites the many enabling legislative actions directing the goals
of the agency. [Deleted in the web published version, as repetitive across portfolios.]
The second part of the report is a high level description of the Food Safety program in
detail. In the second section, we elected to discuss each of the major funding programs
separately. Included in this section are descriptions of the National Research Initiative
(NRI) food safety programs (32.0 and 32.1), the National Integrated Food Safety
Initiative (NIFSI), Special Grants, and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
program. In each description, program mission is stated followed by a statement of
program scope, and numerous program success stories. The separation of the specific
funding programs was deliberate to simplify the review process. However, it should be
understood that none of the programs are independent and each contributes to the overall
goal of improving the safety of the nation’s food. Furthermore, there are numerous
examples of interactions between the programs and grantees within the programs. These
interactions demonstrate that the programs are effectively integrated.
In addition to this report, a third component is represented by the Evidentiary Materials.
This component is provided separately and contains documents and articles that more
provide greater amounts of data on each program. The Evidentiary Materials have been
divided into sections that aid in the overview of the Food Safety Program. This is
followed by additional data on each of the funding programs.
In considering the outcomes from the Food Safety program as described in this report, we
want to emphasize the significance of the outcomes as they relate to federal investment.
Several projects including those related to actual interventions (e.g. product irradiation
guidelines, diagnostic assays, and analysis of the benefits of good agricultural practices
on food safety) demonstrate the strong commitments of the programs to the development
of real world applications. As well, several studies have resulted in basic science
