An SBIR Phase II grant provided to Diachemix, LLC in FY 2003 will help the company
develop the fluorescence polarization assays for fumonisins, aflatoxins and DON
vomitoxins. These assays will offer an efficient way for grain producers and processors
to check for these mycotoxins before bringing the grains to the market. The assays can
be performed in the field, at grain elevators or in remote laboratories without submitting
samples to a central laboratory.
Higher Education
Education programs support all CSREES National Emphasis Areas. These programs
promote teaching excellence, enhance academic quality, and develop tomorrowâ€™s
scientific and professional workforce. In cooperation with public institutions, private
sector partners, and the Land-Grant University System, CSREES provides national
leadership to address critical educational issues. CSREES provides funding opportunities
to support educational programs through several venues including: 1890 Institutions
Teaching and Research Capacity Building Grants Program, Food and Agricultural
Sciences National Needs Graduate and Postgraduate Fellowship Grants Program, and
Higher Education Challenge Grants Program.
Success Stories
California State University, Los Angeles through the Department of Kinesiology and
Nutritional Science is committed to develop an undergraduate program in Food Science
and Technology (FST) with emphasis in Food Safety. This proposed project will support
the FST program in three fundamental ways: 1) by creating a state-of-the-art quality
assurance and food safety laboratory; 2) by providing key faculty members with
advanced training in the rapidly evolving field of food safety; and 3) by enabling
undergraduate FST students to become involved in related research programs that will
enhance their education. This project will help CSULA in recruitment and retention of
Hispanic students and will also help to correct the disparity between the proportion of
Hispanics currently entering the food industry and the Hispanic population at large. The
Hispanic graduates of this program will be among the best trained in Southern California
in issues related to food quality and food safety to make an important difference to public
well-being. This project will help CSULA in recruitment and retention of Hispanic
students and will also help to correct the disparity between the proportion of Hispanics
currently entering the food industry.
The United States has a good record of food safety. In spite of this good record, there are
still many reported cases of food borne illnesses recognized as significant public health
issues. The objectives of the proposed study being performed by Tennessee State
University are: (1) to determine the effectiveness of different types of food safety
information in educating rural consumers about food safety risks and precautions, (2) to
investigate whether there are any differences in the effectiveness of the different types of
food safety information ( for example the USDA's safe handling labels on meat and
poultry or the program to educate consumers to use thermometers when cooking
hamburgers), in educating rural populations about food safety risks and precautions, (3)
