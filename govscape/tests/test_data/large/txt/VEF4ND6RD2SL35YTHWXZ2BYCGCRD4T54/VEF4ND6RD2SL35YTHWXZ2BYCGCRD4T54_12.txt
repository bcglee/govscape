Stakeholder Input
All of the food safety programs in the CSREES have been developed and modified using
extensive stakeholder input. The discussion of stakeholder input is presented as an
aggregate discussion. The NIFSI Program Directors have sponsored three interagency
food safety planning sessions since the inception of the Initiative. Partners and
stakeholders from other Federal food safety agencies have been active participants in
these planning sessions, helping to shape the direction of the CSREES food safety
programs, while eliminating duplication in programming among the agencies. Joint
program initiatives have been established, and grant funds have been made available to
support these interagency initiatives. For example, the Presidential Produce Initiative to
Ensure the Safety of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables is an interagency program. The
Initiative worked cooperatively with Federal partners at the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to quickly incorporate fresh fruit and vegetable safety into its
competitive program portfolio.
Within the two NRI Food Safety program (32.0 and 32.1) stakeholder information is
obtained in several ways. One is through the sponsorship of science meetings where the
entire spectrum of stakeholders is present. For example, two colloquia were sponsored:
one on food safety and biosecurity and the other on agricultural uses of antibiotics.
Participants at these colloquia were invited and the number at each was limited to about
30. Careful attention was paid to the participant lists to insure representation of the
science disciplines, other government agencies, and industry commodity groups (all are
stakeholders). The outcomes from both colloquia were summary reports that included
recommendations for future research, educational programs, and policies within the
subject area. As of April 2004, over 15,000 copies of the summary from the antibiotics
colloquium have been circulated. These documents are available on the web page
(www.asm.org).
Financial support also was provided for other national workshops or conferences
including the 2003 Mycotoxins and Phycotoxins Gordon Conference.
The grantees represent another stakeholder group. The Epidemiologic Approaches for
Food Safety program was the first National Research Initiative (NRI) program to require
annual meetings of the grantees. This was in part to facilitate communication but also to
get “feedback” on the program, emerging research issues, and academic stakeholder
input. The meetings also represent a means for scientists to leverage samples collected in
their studies and to develop synergistic collaborative research projects.
Additional examples of stakeholder input are listed below.
● A public listening session was held in November of 2000. Stakeholders included
university partners, representatives from industry, a consumer advocate, and federal
partners from FSIS, FDA, and ARS. Participants presented food safety priorities from
their representative organizations. In small group break-out sessions, participants
identified overall food safety priorities common to all those working in food safety.
