enormous potential for collaborative projects among other networks, centers, or consortia
and with international partnerships.
Success Stories
A PECASE award was presented in Food Safety from the Epidemiologic Approaches for
Food Safety program in 2000. Dr. Randy Singer received the PECASE for his grant
proposal entitled, “Epidemiology and ecology of antimicrobial resistance determinants on
dairy farms”. Dr. Singer has received additional funding from NSF and the NRI because
of his success.
Dr. Zhang at Iowa State University is supported by 2 different grants that will provide
important data to understand Campylobacter in poultry. These grants have helped them
obtain an NIH RO1 grant to study the antibiotic efflux mechanisms in Campylobacter.
The research revealed that vertical transmission is not a major mode of contamination by
Campylobacter on poultry farms, indicating that control should be focused on
environmental sources. The work also found that Campylobacter is highly mutable after
exposure to fluoroquinolone antibiotics used in chickens, indicating that prudent
measures need to be taken in treating Campylobacter-infected flocks with
fluoroquinolone antimicrobials.
Dr. Norman Stern (ARS) was funded to study the sources and risk factors for
Campylobacter in poultry and the potential impact on human disease in a closed system
(production in Iceland). All poultry consumed in Iceland are produced in Iceland and this
provides an opportunity to identify risk factors for food borne diseases. The US poultry
industry and USDA are setting guidelines/standards for exposure level to Campylobacter
in US produced chicken based upon data from this study. In addition, the significant
impact is finding that freezing chicken will eliminate viable Campylobacter from the
carcass. Therefore, Iceland now uses a direct plating enumeration method to measure the
level of contamination with Campylobacter. When a threshold level is exceeded a
freezing intervention is imposed that reduces the potential for disease in humans.
Because of this, there has been a 70% decrease in domestically-acquired infections.
Denmark and Norway are now considering this same practice.
E. coli remains a significant food safety organism and FSIS has emphasized the need for
interventions at the feedlot level. CSREES has maintained a large number of research
projects related to E.coli interventions and management practices at the feedlot level. For
example, the project entitled, “Epidemiological aspects of combining E.coli 0157:H7
control programs and feedlot performance” at Kansas State University (Sargeant et al)
evaluated different management practices related to fecal shedding of E.coli in feedlot
cattle and quantified the relations between management practices that foster the shedding
of E.coli and feedlot cattle performance. This is one of the first studies looking at the
effect of management practices on average daily gain, feed efficiency, and food safety
issues. This study was pivotal in that the risk factors identified are not amenable to
mitigation. For example, the main risk factors identified were season when slaughter
occurred and feed lot stocking density.
