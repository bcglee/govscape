The National Integrated Food Safety Initiative (NIFSI)
Overview – Mission and Goals
To effectively address the changes in the food safety system, there have been sweeping
changes in the way USDA approaches food safety. USDA has acknowledged
coordination of efforts among researchers, industry, producers, processors, government,
the news media, and consumers to address and solve food safety problems. These
coordinated efforts – or integrated efforts- are essential for continued improvement in the
safety of America’s food supply. NIFSI was developed to address major changes in the
food safety system by focusing on integration of resources and expertise of government,
industry, universities, public and private organizations, and consumers to solve complex
food safety problems. The overall purpose of NIFSI is to fund competitive grants that
use an integrated approach to solving complex food safety problems. By definition,
integrated grants include research, education, and extension activities. The crucial key
here is that integrated, competitive grants allow USDA and CSREES to fund food safety
efforts that move from theory, to data gathering, to data analysis, to testing, to program
development, to implementation and intervention, and finally, to evaluation. This
comprehensive approach provides the basis for an overall integrated food safety program.
