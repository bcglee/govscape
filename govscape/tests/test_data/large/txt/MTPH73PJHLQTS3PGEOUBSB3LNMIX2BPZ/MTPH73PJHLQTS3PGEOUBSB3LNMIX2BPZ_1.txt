steel and one of plastic. Plastic was selected as the less expensive and installation
was completed in 10 days after equipment and supplies arrived. Very minimal volume
of water was pumped once the groundwater level was pumped down. The basin has
been installed and the job is progressing well. Sheet piling was installed 25’ deep and
along a perimeter of 380’ for a cost of $120,000. The piling will be left in place.
Funding sources for the project are RUS, Maryland Department of the Environment,
and Community Development Block Grant.
