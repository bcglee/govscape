COMPARISON OF STATISTICS FOR LANDSAT 5 TM AND LANDSAT 7 ETM
Statistical comparisons in this analysis consist of simple, non-parametric sign tests (Siegel 1956)since the data
are all based on paired samples (ETM+ versus TM for the same areas), and there are not enough pairs to assume
normal distributions for paired ‘t’ tests. Under the sign test, the null (H) hypothesis is that the median difference
0
between ETM+ and TM is zero, with a two sided alternative (H ) hypothesis that it is non-zero. Critical values for
A
the sign test are based on the binomial probability function.
Hypothesis Tests
This set of hypotheses was tested for percent correct (by crop type and overall), commission error (by crop
type), kappa statistic (by crop type and overall), and combined strata r-squared. For the percent correct and kappa
statistics, both by crop type and overall, there was no reason to reject the H of the median difference between TM
0
and ETM+ being zero. However, the same tests, using commission error and combined r-squared do show a
significant difference at the 5% level. Table 5 below shows the sign test values associated with these tests.
Although not shown in this paper, comparisons were also done using only large analysis districts, as defined by
those analysis districts with 45 or more segments. The sign test results for the large AD only analyses mirrored the
‘all AD’ results shown in Table 5. Also considered were number of signatures created from the segment data, both
at the AD level, and by crop. The differences using number of signatures were not significant for either AD level or
by major crop type.
