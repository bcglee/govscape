Training the Classifier Based on Known Sample Information
The NASS automated procedure uses a modified supervised approach in the creation of cover type signatures.
In this approach interior (non-boundary) pixels from known fields, not labeled as bad for training, are sorted
according to cover type into separate files. Using a principle components analysis, additional outlier pixels are
deleted (‘clipped’) from the files (Winings, 1990). Each updated file is then clustered, using a modified ISODATA
algorithm which allows cluster splitting and merging (Bellow, 1991a). A similar process is used to cluster ‘extra’
cover types, such as clouds, urban, and deep water. The resultant signature statistics for clusters from all cover types
are then combined into one statistics file for input to the maximum likelihood classifier. All available known pixels
from the sample segments are categorized using this classifier for regression analysis.
Evaluation of the Maximum Likelihood Classifier
Several statistics are calculated for evaluation of the classifier. Known pixels are tabulated comparing ground
truth labels with the category assigned during classification. Percent correct, commission errors, and kappa
coefficients are calculated automatically from the tabulation. These statistics are calculated (and reported) based on
the ‘not bad for training’ set of known pixels from the segments. A field by field analysis is also performed to check
which signatures cause the most classification errors. Another module calculates regression coefficients by
crop/cover type for farmer reported versus categorized data at the segment level. Segments identified (by the
software) as regression outliers can be reviewed and deleted from the analysis for final estimation purposes. Table 3
below shows percent correct and kappa comparisons over all cover types plus the number of signatures used in the
final classification.
