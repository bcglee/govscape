the state based on percent cultivation of crops. The sample is randomly drawn by strata, with an emphasis toward
minimizing the variances of major crops and livestock estimates. For the 2001 crop season, sample sizes ranged
from 260 in Indiana to 452 in Iowa for our six Program states. Segments are visited in early June, with data
collected directly from personal contacts with farmers. The size of an individual segment is approximately one
square mile in high percent cultivation strata, larger in less cultivated but open area strata, and small in urban areas.
Field boundaries are drawn on black and white aerial photo enlargements of the segment area, and later entered into
digital form and geo-registered to a Landsat scene in the NASS field office. It should be noted here that crops
estimates at the state (but not county) level can be produced using only the ground survey data without the
application of remote sensing imagery. Table 1 below gives an idea of the normal sampling rates for the states
involved in this analysis, plus the number of samples actually used. Two states have two analysis districts (AD’s)
included, the same center scene with an overlap area on each side.

state/strata combinations shown in this analysis average 1 square mile each.
Analysis Districts
Seven analysis districts (AD’s), based on path overlap regions and one day date differences, were selected from
the 1999 and 2000 crop year estimation analyses. These AD’s offer a selection of most major crops and crop
producing regions, with the exception of the winter wheat great plains states. Four states (and eight crops) were
selected: North Dakota (barley, canola, sunflower, all wheat, and all small grains), Arkansas (rice, cotton, soybean),
Mississippi (cotton and soybean), and Iowa (corn and soybean). Note that ‘all small grains’ includes all wheat,
barley, oats, and rye for the purposes of this analysis. Table 2 shows the states, imagery dates, imagery path/row
locations and number of segments used in the comparisons.
