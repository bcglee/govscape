CONCLUSION
The importance of the Landsat 5 TM sensor is that it allows an eight day repeat coverage for imagery
acquisition. This fact is particularly important for crop area estimation, because most intensively cultivated areas
have cloud cover problems. You might think of this as the relationship between intensive cultivation and rain fed
cropping practices. Half of the NASS statewide analysis would be missing if not for the presence of Landsat 5 TM.
Percent correct related statistics are important for ‘map’ and visual image creation, such as for the Cropland
Data Layer distributed by NASS. These statistics include percent correct, commission error, and kappa coefficients.
Although the commission error statistics are different, this measure is usually considered only a complement to the
percent correct, and not as a stand-alone statistic. Considering only the visual side of remote sensing based outputs,
the two sensors would not be significantly different.
However, the r-squared and slope statistics are more important when the aim is to produce crop acreage
indications (estimates) as these are directly related to the standard error of the estimates. The slope statistics are not
significantly different between the two sensors, but the r-squared regression statistics are significantly different. The
r-squared significant differences are perhaps the result of the better commission errors, but for whatever reason, the
differences are small but significant. Under the acreage estimation scenario, the ETM+ data seems to be slightly
better, and given a choice of similar dates between the two sensors, the ETM+ should be used. An interesting point
to consider is how close in performance the data from Landsat 5 TM, launched in March 1984, is to the data from
the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, launched in April, 1999.
