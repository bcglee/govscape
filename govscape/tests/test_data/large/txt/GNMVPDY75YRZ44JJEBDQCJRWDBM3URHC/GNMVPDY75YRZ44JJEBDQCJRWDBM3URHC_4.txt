summarized based on land use strata and boundaries from the area sampling frame. A regression estimation
approach is then applied, using classified pixels as the auxiliary variable and farmer reported acres as the dependent
variable in a set of area frame stratum based simple linear regressions. The county and state crop acreage estimates
produced by this system greatly reduce the sampling variation (‘error’) found in the estimates produced by the
ground data alone; and have the added benefits of producing county estimates with measurable precision. Table 4
below displays the various statistics available to compare at the crop type level. Regression line slopes were also
calculated, but are not shown in the table. In order to compare data with the least possible analyst interference, no
segment outlier analysis was performed on any of the AD’s. No Kappa statistics were available for the grouped
categories (all wheat and all small grains) due to software limitations.
