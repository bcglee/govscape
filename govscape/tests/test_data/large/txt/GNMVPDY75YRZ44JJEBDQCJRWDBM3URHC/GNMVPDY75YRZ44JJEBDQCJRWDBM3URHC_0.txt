ABSTRACT
This paper compares digital, multi-spectral imagery from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper with that of the Landsat 7
Enhanced Thematic Mapper when used to discriminate crop types for area estimation. Comparisons are done for
different types of crop areas in several states, using images that are only one day apart. The overlaps between
adjacent paths in several major crops states are used to define the analysis areas. A simple non-parametric paired
sample sign test is used to determine statistical significance of differences. Standardized techniques as used in the
Agency's Cropland Data Layer Project are used for image processing, including a modified supervised pattern
recognition /clustering approach for cover type signatures and maximum likelihood for categorization. Ground truth
data consist of 211 one and two square mile areas selected in a stratified random sample and visited in June of the
corresponding crop year. Sampling rates for the ground data range from one in 30 to one in 166 depending on the
state and land use stratum.
INTRODUCTION
The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has used digital
multi-spectral satellite imagery since the 1970's to aid in the acreage estimation of large area crops in major
producing states. Early research and later operational NASS remote sensing programs used imagery from the
Landsat multi-spectral scanner instruments until the late 1980's; research on the Landsat Thematic Mapper started in
1986 and it was adopted for operational acreage estimation use in 1991. The current NASS Remote Sensing
Acreage Estimation Program (Craig 2001b) encompasses Landsat-based major crops estimates at the state and
county levels plus digital Cropland Data Layer GIS products for six major crop producing states. Numerous
documents about the history of this Program are included in the References section.
Landsat Digital Imagery
Two Landsat satellites are currently operational; Landsat 5 with the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor, and Landsat
7 with a somewhat upgraded Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) sensor. Imagery from both sensors was at 30 meter
resolution, and delivered in the UTM coordinate system. Landsat data from both sensors is obtained through a
cooperative agreement with the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service (Bethel and Doorn 1998). The polar orbits of
these two satellites are controlled to give eight day coverage to any area from one of the sensors. The eight day
repeat coverage is very important to any vegetation related remote sensing analysis, and is particularly important for
real time, within season crop acreage and or yield estimation. Crop types are distinguishable from each other for
only a short period during the crop season, and thus have a very limited number of chances to be covered by
cloud-free satellite imagery.
There is a side by side overlap of approximately 30 percent of a scene between adjacent paths of the satellites;
this overlap can be covered by scenes (one from each satellite) that are one day apart. This research compares the
two types of digital imagery using only the areas in the overlap of scenes separated by one day. These overlap areas
define ‘analysis districts’ which will be processed the same way for each Landsat satellite sensor; highlights of the
image processing and estimation methodology will be discussed in a later section.
Ground Truth Data
Ground truth for the Remote Sensing Acreage Estimation Program comes from a pre-existing Agency
nationwide survey program, called the June Agricultural Survey (JAS). One part of the JAS utilizes an area frame to
select areas of land, called segments, for field visits. The area frame for a given state is a land use stratification of
