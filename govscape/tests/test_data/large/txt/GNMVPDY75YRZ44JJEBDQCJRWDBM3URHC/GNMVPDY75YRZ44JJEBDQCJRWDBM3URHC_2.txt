HIGHLIGHTS OF IMAGE PROCESSING AND ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY
The current NASS system for processing satellite remote sensing data and the statistical methodology used for
estimation of crop acreage was discussed in detail in the ASPRS 2001 proceedings (Craig 2001a). This section
presents the highlights of these procedures for review.
Software and Hardware
NASS uses the PEDITOR software system (Ozga 1995,2000) to process Landsat digital imagery on high-end
desktop computers using the Windows NT operating system. There is usually at least one dual processor Win NT
computer at each site for large volume batch processing. PEDITOR is an in-house created and maintained software
system of over 100 program modules, some of which are expert systems designed to automate parts of the process by
running other modules in sequence. There is one main difference between this software and commercial software:
the regression analysis procedure and its concept of a segment as a clustered sample (as opposed to just as individual
fields for training) from a specific stratum.
Imagery Import and Review of Sample Segments
Location and review of sampled areas in the current years imagery starts with the reformatting (import) of
selected imagery into PEDITOR format. NASS uses all seven Landsat TM and/or ETM bands for training and
classification. Where available, multi-temporal (two date) imagery is created using an automated block correlation
approach. Segment and internal field boundaries are overlaid on the new imagery, and are reviewed on a field by
field basis to identify any ‘bad’ fields where the reported data does not match the information seen in the digital
satellite imagery. This process includes such things as cropland already harvested, poor crop stands, cloud and haze
affected areas, poorly drawn boundaries, and areas where the planted cover observed during enumeration does not
match the farmer reported cover. Fields with problems that cannot be corrected are identified and later marked as
‘bad for training’. Cloud affected segments are removed from consideration with respect to the specified scene.
