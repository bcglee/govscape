Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century 10
were given general eligibility criteria (e.g., counties where half of the farmers earned less than
$2,500 in cash income) and were asked to nominate counties after securing the consent of the
local political leadership.
By the beginning of 1957, 57 counties had been selected.20 This number slowly expanded
until 200 counties were participating in the program by the end of 1960. All of them were
located in the regions pinpointed by the Human Resources report. None came from the Great
Plains or Midwest where the incidence of rural poverty was lower. Even though low income was
a criterion for involvement, Doherty wanted to avoid use of the term because he feared it would
discourage potential participants who did not want to be stigmatized by the label. He suggested
that instead "as much as possible, we should use such terms as Rural Development Program,
community development, cooperative local efforts, family-type farm, successful part-time
farming, small farmers, farm progress, etc." This advice was usually followed during the next 5
years but it was impossible to totally expunge the term, especially from research publications.21
In the 1950s rural development basically consisted of extension workers helping
community leaders to organize state and county rural development committees which then
explored ways of improving social and economic conditions. Meanwhile, the Washington office
of USDA provided moral support with a steady stream of "how-to" and success-story pamphlets.
At the end of 1956, Don Paarlberg summarized the status of the program at that point
before the American Farm Economic Association. After describing conditions in rural America
and the self-help philosophy underlying the program, he noted that of the 24 States participating
in the program at least 20 of them had formed committees to provide statewide direction. These
committees differed in their makeup but that "in all cases, nonagricultural agencies working in
the State are represented, either as full or participating members." Paarlberg cited the case of
North Carolina where the State welfare and health agencies, industrial education, and small
industrial commissions all had a part in the work of the rural development committee. Perhaps
most encouraging of all for the future of rural development was that in "some instances the first
meeting of the rural development committee was also the occasion for the first meeting between
representatives of one agency and another."22
By early 1957, farm economists outside USDA were beginning to take notice of the
program. Writing in the May 1957 issue of the Journal of Farm Economics, University of
Wisconsin professor Raymond J. Penn made several interesting observations. He noted that rural
development had previously been limited to low-income areas, but that this restricted focus
"prevents activities in many regions where substantial progress might result from small effort. . .
And it cannot even be limited to ‘rural’ areas, since the program once underway must also
include urban people." He pointed out that since the program had been assigned to the Extension
Service it was primarily an educational and planning effort and was short on "action". Penn
concluded that:
"The rural development program is based on some very good ideas. It is facing some
serious difficulties. It has possibilities of becoming a strategic part of a most important economic
development program for the whole economy, not simply rural areas."23
In February 1957, a special report written by Doherty summarized the early
accomplishments of the program. For the most part it consisted of anecdotal accounts of local
success stories. The following account is typical of those appearing in this and similar
publications:
