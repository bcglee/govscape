True D. Morse and the Beginning of the Post War Rural Development Work 11
"Leaders in Tippah County, Mississippi, in the southeastern hilly area of the Nation, are
doing something about the serious economic problems they face. . .
"In mid-November 1955 Tippah's people formed a rural development committee, which
is representative of farm, business, civic, youth, and government interests in the area. . .
". . .A small clothing factory, employing 250 people, has already located in the county in
a building remodeled by local people. Money raised by subscription from businessmen and the
more prosperous farmers has financed a milk receiving plant, which will not only employ county
workers but also provide a new market for dairy farmers. . .
"Farm and home unit planning has also received new encouragement through the work of
the rural development committee. Early in the program, a special two-day meeting of State and
local representatives of the Extension Service, Soil Conservation Service [SCS], and the Farmers
Home Administration developed a unified farm and home plan acceptable to each of them which
will be used in educational work with small farmers.
"Three Extension Service employees are working half their time on Rural Development
Program projects, and one technician has also been added to the county SCS staff. These and
other agency representatives are helping the rural development committee put its own program
on a firm base and move into coordinated, countywide economic improvement."24
As this report indicates, other USDA agencies were also involved in rural development,
although the Extension Service was the lead agency throughout the 1950s. For instance, in 1956
the Soil Conservation Service contributed more than 12,000 man-hours of time to conservation
work in pilot counties. According to Doherty's report, the FmHA had opened full- or part-time
lending offices in 8 pilot counties where offices had not been previously located and a total of 23
employees had been hired for pilot areas or had been transferred to them. Doherty also claimed
that many county rural development committees included members of the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service and that in some places they had increased cost-sharing
payments for certain practices to encourage conservation improvement in the program.
The rural development program was of particular interest in West Virginia where farm
incomes were generally very low. In May 1957, J.O. Knapp, Director of State Extension at West
Virginia University, had great hopes that the program could improve conditions in his state.
Lewis County was picked as the first pilot county in West Virginia using the following criteria:
(1) that a majority of the county's population live on farms and depend on farming for the major
part of their income; (2) that there be some potential in the quality of soil and topography for the
improvement of farm income; (3) that the people of the county be willing and interested in
participating in the program; (4) that marketing facilities be available; (5) that opportunities be
available for vocational training; (6) that there exist the possibility of some financial support
from local sources.
A county meeting was held at which "all segments of the county population were
represented." A 15-member county committee was formed and this committee in turn decided to
form sub-committees to study: (1) labor, (2) industry, (3) farm marketing, (4) education, (5)
transportation and communication, (6) water resources, (7) land use, (8) health and recreation,
(9) credit and loans, (10) public assistance, (11) public facilities, (12) natural resources, and (13)
publicity and promotion.
