True D. Morse and the Beginning of the Post War Rural Development Work 13
the creation of the program in 1955.29 By this time Morse, who had a passionate attachment to
rural development, was becoming frustrated by the lack of attention it was receiving, both from
within USDA and from the media. In retrospect, it appears that the executive order did not
accomplish much, but at the time it must have a given a boost to Morse's flagging enthusiasm.
Actually, there had been a few articles about the program since 1956. Most of these had
appeared in rural newspapers. In February 1959, the National Planning Association took notice
of the program and issued a report that looked favorably on the idea and Morse's commitment to
it but faulted it for "having failed to see the magnitude of the situation."30 According to the
Association, the program's leaders had become victims of their propaganda. A few new factories
and projects here and there were fine but insignificant given the extent of the problem. "Valuable
though such local projects may be in their own right, they might be multiplied many fold without
making more than a small dent in the huge problem at hand." A few months later, the Christian
Science Monitor published a generally favorable article with the headline "Operation Bootstrap",
which Morse disliked because it ignored the Federal Government's role. After reporting that the
program had stimulated some preliminary activity and had increased awareness of the problem,
the paper cited the National Planning Associationâ€™s earlier criticism and concluded that:
"The answer as to whether the Rural Development Program in its present form offers the
nucleus of the long-needed solution awaits the further test of time and experience. But even its
most vocal critics are likely to concede that this program represents the first organized, fruitful
effort to devise long-range, widely applicable solutions for one of the nation's most heart-stirring
problems."31
Pilot Program Winds Down
In October 1960, several USDA staff members concurred with these outside evaluations,
in a paper presented at the Regional Rural Development Workshop at the University of
Nebraska. The paper summarized the current state of knowledge concerning rural America, and
its conclusions were less optimistic than those presented at the Memphis conference 2 years
earlier. Although they did not refer directly to the Rural Development Program, their
observations certainly could have been interpreted as recommendations for future action.
They noted that the proportion of nonfarm income for farmers in low-income areas was
surprisingly high, which supported the view that a "broader approach to the solution of the low-
income problem than on-farm adjustments is necessary."
Many of these areas were poor because natural resource industries such as coal and
timber had declined, forcing communities to depend more on marginal agriculture production.
Since much of the problem of low-income areas had its origins outside of agriculture, much of
the solution would have to come from other sectors of the economy. Looking ahead 15 years,
they predicted that agriculture would require one-third less man-hours of labor or 2 million fewer
workers. One of the biggest problems was that younger and better educated people were
emigrating from rural areas, leaving behind older and very young people, who contributed less to
the local economy. Their use of adjectives such as "drastic" to describe changes in rural America
underscored the seriousness with which they viewed the situation. They noted that smaller trade
and service centers were being supplanted by more remote and larger centers, which in turn
affected governmental functions, utilities, hospitals, schools, and other local institutions. In other
words, these economists were implying that the scope of rural development had to be expanded
