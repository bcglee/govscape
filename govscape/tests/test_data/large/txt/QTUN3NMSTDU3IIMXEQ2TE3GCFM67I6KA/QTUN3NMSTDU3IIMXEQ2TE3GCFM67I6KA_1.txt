The first step in planning was to make a complete survey of all the physical, biological,
social, economic and other factors affecting an area because an "intelligent and objective study is
necessary if an effective program is to be built." Next came the drafting of the community plan
and basic program: "Management cannot function effectively without a program which clearly
sets out the goals and the way in which they are to be reached." The third step was the long-term
administration of the program so that it conformed to the basic plan: "Any community that
would make the most effective growth and development must be constantly guided toward the
ultimate objective."
Morse saw the community survey as consisting of: (1) boundaries of the community or
trade area; (2) natural physical factors; (3) climatic factors; (4) government and governmental
agencies; (5) public developments such as roads, schools, churches, hospitals, parks and
drainage; (6) private developments, including both town and farm properties and companies; (7)
economic functions and the way in which business operates in the local markets; (8) people,
including ethnic composition and educational levels; (9) finances, including both public and
private resources and indebtedness; (10) other factors discovered during the survey. Fifteen years
later many rural communities were conducting surveys modeled after the elements in this
proposal of 1944.
Morse then counseled his listeners that such a time-consuming survey should be
undertaken only if the community was strongly committed to putting it to use in a development
program: "Those placed in charge must be capable of weighing all facts revealed by the study
and setting up a specific program to guide continuing developments."
The plan was to be made up of steps that would seek to optimize farm productivity and
rationalize the distribution of credit. Morse wanted to diversify farm operations so that they
would be less vulnerable to market fluctuations. He observed that off-farm labor had become
increasingly important to farmers and speculated that diversified farms could absorb much of this
