Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century 14
beyond low-income areas. Their final remarks pointed the way to the future of rural development
policy.
"The problems of our farm people in rural areas are closely linked to those of nonfarm
people. We cannot expect satisfactory separate solutions of their problems. [The] Solution will
require a broader look at problems and closer working relationships among the people involved
and among agencies of government concerned with programs of alleviation."32
Some insiders thought the program had run out of steam and might disappear altogether
when the new Kennedy administration took over. In October 1960, Joseph Doherty wrote to
program coordinator Garland Marshall that the pilot concept was inadequate. What was needed
were State and multi-county committees instead of "the approach to the program in the various
states (which) is so varied and lacking in overall direction that in too many cases program goals
and intentions set forth by the Committee are obscured, if not lost altogether."33
However, looking back at the program from the perspective of 30 years of subsequent
history, Doherty's assessment of Morse's achievement is much more positive. Because Morse's
work was often criticized by his Democratic successors as being little more than a
"smokescreen" for Republican agricultural policies, it is worth quoting Doherty's reminiscences
at some length.
"True Morse never believed the "pilot" RDP, which got started around about ’55 or ’56
after Congressman Whitten grudgingly allowed a little money for Extension, was the real
essence of the program, even on a start up basis. He believed the idea of local leaders getting
together, assessing their community's pluses and minuses, and putting together a plan for long-
term economic-social improvement had universal applicability in poor, backward, marginal, etc.
farming areas. He also believed that if only the USDA public information apparatus could be
used aggressively and dynamically, the media and the cause groups would see the light and go
forth with the word. He was much more appreciative and pleased with from-the-grassroots
programs that had no or little government or university impetus than with those pushed into
being by the USDA-State network of professional people, not that he disdained the latter. He
simply didn't believe they had to get things started. . .
"The problem with this concept was, of course, that the ‘Inside the Beltway’ media, even
in that distant past, didn't believe anything was real unless there was a lot of Federal money and
Federal administration involved. . . If I recall, commodity programs were their bread and butter
but politics was their real interest, and they were uniformly dubious of the Ike-Benson axis, a
dubiousness nurtured and enlarged by many of their professional (i.e. career people) contacts in
USDA, . . .
"Among my many duties at the time, was I guess I'd have to put it, doing the impossible,
i.e., selling the journalists on the concept of community organization and development. Thanks
to State initiatives, this has become a commonplace now throughout the U.S. In 1955 or so,
reporters covering the Department simply considered it a joke, a way for the Republicans to
throw dust in everyone's eyes while they made deep cuts in farm programs. Through one means
or another, we did over the years manage to place objective stories here and there with
independent writers or papers. . ., but in general because of the reporters' attitude around USDA,
little news or feature stories were ever filed, which pained True deeply since he believed
sincerely (if naively) he had some ideas which the world should know about."34
