Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century 6
people - that is, the degree to which they have become a part of the community." He went on to
say that in the preceding years rural society had become increasingly differentiated, and that in
many areas formal organizations with ties to federal agencies had replaced informal associations.
The ability to affect the development of these communities, Ensminger argued, would be based
on understanding the significant group relationships and the basic trends in organization and in
continuing to interpret them in meaningful terms, "so that those who seek to guide and give
leadership to rural life in programs may do so with knowledge and wisdom." The implication of
this article was that Federal agencies would have to work through local associations and
governments if they were to succeed. In other words, rural sociologists were reaching
conclusions similar to those of True D. Morse.9
The Eisenhower Administration
Dwight D. Eisenhower became President in 1953 and appointed Ezra Taft Benson as his
Secretary of Agriculture. Benson favored a free market in agricultural commodities. Benson’s
principal objective was to lower and ultimately abolish government support payments to farmers.
He did not seem to be the kind of secretary who would favor a federal rural development
program. However, he selected True D. Morse as his Undersecretary, and Morse was able to
convince Benson of the need for a modest program aimed at low-income farmers. Morse most
likely strengthened his case by telling Benson that such a program could be used to indirectly
criticize federal commodity payments by showing how they had not benefited low-income
farmers. Benson picked up this idea and soon was fond of saying that "if we had spent half as
much money and effort during the past 25 years to develop agriculture's human resources as we
have spent trying to support the prices of farm products and control production, both farmers and
non-farmers would be better off."10
In January 1954, President Eisenhower issued a special message on agriculture stating in
part that "the chief beneficiaries of our price-support policies have been the two million larger
highly mechanized farming units which produce about 85 percent of our agricultural output . . .
Special attention should be given to the problems peculiar to small farmers."11 This was the
signal to undertake a study of low-income farmers, which Morse assigned to Don Paarlberg, an
assistant secretary and economist, formerly with Purdue University, where an interest in rural
development had begun several years earlier.
Paarlberg and a team of researchers formed a Task Force and spent the next year studying
the problem. It soon became clear that the idea of rural development would not be accorded
immediate approval within USDA itself. For instance, Calvin Beale, who later became USDA's
leading interpreter of rural demographic trends, recalls a meeting in 1954 at which an official of
the Extension Service informed the task force that his agency would not be able to participate in
such a program. Beale recalls that he went on to say that:
“The county officials who paid part of the agents' salaries would not tolerate any work by
the agents in programs that might lead to development of local nonfarm employment
(competitive with farm labor) or training programs for nonfarm employment or provision of
information about nonfarm jobs. And that was the end of Extension's participation in that task
force. Clearly, however, the message got through over time, and soon Extension Service was
involved with more enthusiasm."12
