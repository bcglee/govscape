True D. Morse and the Beginnings of Post-War Rural
Development Work
Dennis Roth
True D. Morse’s Early Work
Between World War II and 1955, the Federal Government was relatively uninvolved in
rural development. The postwar economic recovery obscured to some extent the problems that
still existed in rural America. Many Americans, when they thought of rural areas at all, assumed
that they too were enjoying the fruits of prosperity and, thus, there was little political pressure
for a renewal of New Deal-style programs. Only a few policymakers, such as USDA Secretary
Charles Brannan (1948-1953), attempted to move against this current. This period, however, did
see the beginning of private sector efforts to improve rural conditions.
The Doane Agricultural Service, a private firm in St. Louis, MO headed by True D.
Morse, future USDA Undersecretary and leader of the rural development program from 1954 to
1960, provided planning assistance to individual farms. It drew detailed maps, analyzed soils and
productivity, investigated local markets and community structures, and then produced a farm
management plan - "a long-term program, an architectural design, to guide the future
development and operations of the property to achieve maximum results."
In the late 1930s it began to assist "large lending organizations" in setting up their future
farm loan programs. Part of the work involved the making of State studies, with detailed
statistics and maps. A measuring process was developed to reflect the influence of various
factors. Doane's final product was a state map of farm loan territories, which outlined "policies to
be followed in making farm or ranch loans adapted to the specific area and its debt-carrying
capacity."
As a result of this kind of work, Morse gained much experience in both local and
regional planning. On July 27, 1944 he presented a talk entitled "Rural Community
Development" to the Southwestern Institute for Commercial Executives in Dallas, TX. During
this speech Morse discussed many of the issues that would become staples of the rural
development program of the 1950s, and was perhaps the first person to publicly utter the
expression “rural community development.”
Morse began by warning his listeners of the drastic changes that would affect agriculture
when the war was over. In particular, he predicted that southern agriculture would lose thousands
of jobs to mechanical cotton pickers (fig. 5). Agriculture was facing a major shakeout that would
result in the demise of many rural communities. However, those communities that consciously
planned for the future would have a much better chance of surviving. According to Morse,
"Nothing could be more fascinating and productive of greater benefit than building a program for
a permanently progressive community and then, through the years, molding it to fit the pattern."
