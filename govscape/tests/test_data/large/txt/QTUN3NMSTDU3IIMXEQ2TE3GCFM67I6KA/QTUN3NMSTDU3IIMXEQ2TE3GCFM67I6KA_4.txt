Agriculture." He foresaw the creation of job training programs "with financial assistance to
cooperating industries in the training program; financing transportation and moving costs to new
job opportunities with special attention to nearby areas; subsistence grants to new employees
during the training period . . . and expansion of recruitment and placement facilities in areas of
heavy agricultural underemployment."
3. A program for the benefit of families or persons who gain their living principally as
hired farm workers. Here he sought legislation that would extend wage and hour standards,
social security, unemployment insurance, and workmen's compensation to farm workers and
create standards for housing. In addition, he advocated that special job placement aids,
transportation assistance, relaxation of State residence requirements for health and welfare
services, and more education facilities for children be provided to farm workers and their
families. Brannan told the panel that these activities would "require a division of labor to be
worked out between the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Federal
Security Agency, and other Federal and State agencies."
In addition to the need to promote social justice, Brannan justified these programs on the
basis that rural underconsumption was slowing national economic growth and that a
disproportionately large number of future citizens would come from the ranks of the rural poor.
He predicted that "if these children reach maturity embittered by the experiences of their early
lives and ill-equipped for the economic struggle, the effect on the American future will not be
good." One of his congressional interlocutors observed that the poor might then migrate to the
cities where they could fall victim to communist propaganda. Brannan's proposal might then be
seen "as our greatest bulwark right there to help these people before they go in and live in these
teeming slums."
In both its overall thrust and its specific details, Brannanâ€™s proposals anticipated those
put forward by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations 11 to 15 years later. His warning that
rural poverty could corrupt national life by forcing millions of unprepared poor people into cities
foreshadowed the debate over rural/urban population and development imbalance begun by
Secretary Orville Freeman in 1965.7 But 1949 was not the right time to ask for major changes in
rural policy, as was soon shown by the demise of USDA's Bureau of Agricultural Economics
(BAE).
In the 1930s, BAE became one of the principal staff groups supporting New Deal
agriculture and agricultural resettlement policies. After the war it turned its attention to cotton
production in the South. A BAE study concluded that most of the laborers, tenants, and small
farmers employed in cotton production would soon have to find other work. BAE economists
proposed incentives and training programs for this purpose and also wrote a report entitled
"Cultural Reconnaissance" that contained references to race relations, white supremacy, and
racial segregation. Important southern congressmen were very critical of this kind of rural
development research, and a departmental reorganization in 1953 abolished BAE and scattered
its economists among other agencies. Another way would have to be found to promote rural
development, one that avoided even the hint of direct federal intervention in local communities.8
In 1950, rural sociologist Douglas Ensminger pointed to some characteristics of rural
areas that future rural developers would attempt to take advantage of. Writing in Rural Life in
the United States, Ensminger asserted that the "record to date shows that agencies have
succeeded or failed depending upon the degree to which they have entered the culture of the
