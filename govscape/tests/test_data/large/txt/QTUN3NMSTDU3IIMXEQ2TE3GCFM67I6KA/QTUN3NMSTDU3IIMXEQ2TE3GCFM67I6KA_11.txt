Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century 12
The associate county agent coordinated activities between the committees. According to
Knapp, all government organizations within the county were cooperating to the maximum degree
but served only in an advisory capacity on committees and did not have voting powers. This, of
course, was consistent with the philosophy of the program and was standard operating procedure
for federal agencies in all of the pilot counties.
Knapp then listed six preliminary accomplishments of the Lewis County program and
concluded his report with high hopes for the future.
"There have been other results both tangible and intangible. Most important, however, is
the fact that the county committees spent much time determining resources and goals. They
planned well. Now, these committees can move forward on a broad front with some assurance of
success. You can only create additional problems by hasty actions."25
Price County, WI was one of the most ambitious success stories for the Extension Service
in the early history of the pilot program. In late 1955 a development committee and several
working committees began planning, led by the county Extension staff and including farm and
village residents, as well as those from most of the towns. Rural sociologists, agricultural
economists, foresters, and others from the University of Wisconsin contributed their efforts,
using an intensive educational program to stimulate community leadership, small businesses, and
the tourist industry. The 2-year project “set the pattern for total involvement, with all county
agents and personnel working toward the goal of overall community improvement and
progress.”26
A Committee for Rural Development Program was formed in 1957 and included the
undersecretaries from the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Commerce, Labor, Health
Education and Welfare, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and a member
of the Council on Economic Advisors. (There had been some cooperation among departments
since 1956.) In 1958, this committee (and others) participated in a conference on rural
development held in Memphis, TN. Many of the presentations were devoted to the potential
benefits of tourism for rural areas, apparently the first time that tourism was accorded such an
important potential role in rural development. The growing awareness of tourism stemmed from
the impact of federal interstate highway construction on rural areas.27 In fact, looking back on
this period, Joseph Doherty believes that the new interstates, begun in 1956 after the passage of
the Federal Aid Highway Act, had the largest impact of any program on rural areas.28 Not only
did they allow more people to visit rural areas but they also made it more attractive to locate
industry in rural areas near cities. What was probably not noticed at the time was that Federal
highways further marginalized many other rural areas that were outside their orbit of influence.
The conference identified seven important trends in rural America society: (1) rural
standards of living were improving and rural/urban differences were diminishing; (2) rural
education was improving; (3) there were fewer and larger commercial farms; (4) farming was
becoming more specialized; (5) there was more part-time farming combined with part-time non-
farm work; (6) there were more nonfarm residents in rural areas; and (7) city dwellers were
making greater use of rural areas for recreation. Given this rather optimistic assessment of trends
in many of the more prosperous rural areas, the participants agreed that the rural development
program should continue to focus on low-income counties.
In 1959, President Eisenhower issued an executive order formalizing the Committee for
Rural Development Programs. True D. Morse called this order the "most important event" since
