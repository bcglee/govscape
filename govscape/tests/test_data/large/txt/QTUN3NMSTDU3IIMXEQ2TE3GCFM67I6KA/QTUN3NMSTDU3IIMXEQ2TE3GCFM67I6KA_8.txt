True D. Morse and the Beginning of the Post War Rural Development Work 9
participants were encouraged to make suggestions. In June he appeared before the House
Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations. To those skeptical members who did not see much
new in his ideas, Morse replied:
"The program before you is a modest one. It is modest for reasons of prudence, because
we will be learning as we go and we wish to build soundly on experience. . .
"I have heard it said that there is little which is new in the Rural Development Program.
Of its separate parts this is undoubtedly true to a certain extent. But the coordination of these
separate parts is new, the emphasis on a balanced vocational training program is new, the
adoption of the farm unit approach is new, and the high degree of local responsibility is new.
Especially, the emphasis we propose to place in this program is new. In any case, we are less
concerned with whether the program is new than whether it is good; we are less concerned with
documenting its parentage than with charting its future."16
Morse said the program was limited by available personnel and "the restricted inventory
of knowledge as to how we might best proceed." Therefore, he favored a cautious approach, one
that avoided "over-selling" the program so that people did not get unrealistic expectations that
USDA would solve problems that "go back a hundred years or more." On the other hand, he told
them once the program had begun "we must not falter" and must show evidence of "forward
motion."
In 1955 Congress passed an amendment (PL-360) to the Smith-Lever Act, which had
created the Extension Service in 1914, authorizing the use of special funds for projects in low-
income counties. According to the amendment, the Service was to give “assistance and
counseling to local groups in appraising resources for capability of improvements in agriculture
or introduction of industry designed to supplement farm income [and] cooperation with other
agencies and groups in furnishing all possible information as to existing employment
opportunities.”17 Congress appropriated most of the funds requested, thus permitting the Service
to hire 120 new extension workers. This was to be the only piece of specific rural development
legislation passed during the Eisenhower administration.
As previously mentioned, Congress was generally indifferent to the program. For
instance, in 1957 the Extension Service received an appropriation for $640,000. By 1960 that
amount had risen to only $2,000,000. One of the reasons for the low levels of funding was the
opposition of Jamie Whitten (D-MS), chairman of the House Agricultural Appropriations
Subcommittee. In 1956 Congressman Whitten asserted that "the Rural Development Program,
which was offered several years ago to help low-income farmers of the country, is another
program adopted by the Secretary as a substitute for adequate farm income."18 According to
Doherty, Whitten was eventually persuaded to accept some modest funding requests after the
intercession of two of his colleagues on the subcommittee. Whitten, however, was not alone.
Many congressional Democrats suspected that "rural development" was a smokescreen to cut
price supports and Benson's statements linking the two programs did nothing to dampen those
suspicions. In any case, Morse was not worried about funding, preferring instead to go slowly
with a pilot program.19
Pilot Rural Development Program
Pilot rural development counties were not chosen directly by USDA. To do so would
have violated a basic premise of Morse's self-help philosophy. Rather, State agricultural colleges
