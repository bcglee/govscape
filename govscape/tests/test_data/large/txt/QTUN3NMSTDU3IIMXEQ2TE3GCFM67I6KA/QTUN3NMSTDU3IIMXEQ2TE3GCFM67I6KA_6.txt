True D. Morse and the Beginning of the Post War Rural Development Work 7
Although the Extension Service did, indeed, eventually participate in the rural
development program, this official touched on problems that would affect his organization for
many years to come. USDA was not organized to deal with low-income farmers or the rural
nonfarm population, and its agencies would need to be convinced of the need to direct more
attention to these groups.
In April 1955, Paarlberg's Task Force published a 44-page booklet entitled the
Development of Agriculture's Human Resources: A Report on Problems of Low-Income
Farmers. The report began by pointing out that in 1950 there were 5.4 million farm operator
families in the United States of which 1.5 million, mostly small farmers, had annual cash
incomes under $1,000. The problem was significant and the approach to it, the report continued,
must be primarily educational and developmental. Some aids and credit could be used to enhance
the opportunities for off-farm employment, but it was considered that whatever was to be done
"must be done within the American philosophy that each individual make his own decisions and
set his own goals."13
The Task Force found that in nearly 1,000 counties, most of them in the South,
Southwest, Upper Great Lakes, Ozarks, Appalachia, and the Northwest, one half of the farmers
were dependent "on the income from small, poorly paying farms." In the South and Southwest,
rural poverty was frequently associated with the presence of oppressed minority populations.
(That language, however, was not used in 1955.) In other cases, the Task Force discovered that
low-income farms were often found in areas which once had hosted rural industries such as
lumbering and mining. When these extractive industries declined, many people were left without
supplemental income or were forced onto marginal subsistence farms in order to survive. During
the Depression the Farm Security Administration, which in 1946 became the FmHA, had
assisted some small farmers to move from marginal land into new farming communities, but this
kind of direct New Deal assistance to small farmers was no longer politically acceptable.
The report recognized that little practical aid could be given to older people "outside the
range of welfare and social security services," but that younger farmers could benefit from
vocational training, better credit, better management, and better information on crops and
livestock. The report recommended 14 steps to improve employment and training opportunities:
1. Federal and State agencies should expand their extension services and launch an
experimental rural outreach program in a limited number of counties to gain experience.
2. Private and cooperative lending agencies should be encouraged to extend more
intermediate-term loans to worthy borrowers trying to develop farms.
3. The Farmers Home Administration should also loan more money "to supplement
private and cooperative sources."
4. A State-Federal research program should examine employment, training, and farming
adjustments.
5. In cooperation with USDA, the Land-Grant colleges should hold State and regional
meetings to discuss adapting ideas to local needs.
6. State employment services should improve their services to low-income farmers.
7. The Federal Government should identify areas of rural underemployment and include
them "as part of the labor market services to make occupational adjustments easier."
8. USDA should work with the defense industry to develop employment opportunities in
rural areas.
