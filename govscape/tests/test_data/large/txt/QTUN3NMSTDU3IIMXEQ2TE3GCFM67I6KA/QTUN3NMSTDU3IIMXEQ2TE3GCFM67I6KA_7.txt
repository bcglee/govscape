Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century 8
9. The Federal Government should improve educational and vocational training
opportunities by revising formulas for grants in aid.
10. USDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare should set up pilot
vocational training programs.
11. USDA and State agricultural colleges should participate in the White House's 1955
Conference on Education.
12. Rural people should be informed about how to qualify for Social Security. Inclusion
of farmers under Social Security beginning in 1955 was an important step.
13. Government should promote better health and nutrition.
14. Private trade area programs and community development efforts have been effective.
Farm, business, and community leaders should unite in efforts to develop their communities.
Another important suggestion was that pilot counties be selected "in a sufficient number.
. . in each low-income area to cover the range of different conditions." In these pilot counties
consideration should be given to "setting up county and community committees with a broad
base of participation; assembling materials for analysis or planning through cooperative efforts
by all agencies concerned; using farm and home management specialist teams to work with
individual farmers; exploring methods of working with farm people of limited opportunities; and
developing community programs and goals."14
In general, the report presented a concise and well-written analysis of the problem of
rural poverty, and it still holds up today as one of USDA's best research efforts in the field. What
it did not contain was a call for any kind of large governmental program. Obviously, such a
recommendation would have been inconsistent with the market-oriented philosophy of Benson
and Morse, although many USDA economists, holdovers from the New Deal era, would have
supported it. Given this situation, the rural development program had to depend much more on
exhortation and example than on federal money.
Morseâ€™s Program Begins
The limited scope of the program was apparent almost immediately. In 1955, Joseph J.
Doherty, at that time a junior (GS-9) public affairs specialist, was selected to run the daily
business of the program. Morse attempted to get Congress to fund Doherty's position but the
agriculture committees refused to do so, which was one indication of how the congressional
leadership viewed the program.
During the next five years Doherty wrote or edited almost everything about rural
development that came out of the Washington office of USDA, including the annual reports.
During those years he said he worked harder than at any other time in his life. Because his
position was not officially funded, he kept his desk in the Public Affairs Office and recalls that
some of his colleagues looked somewhat askance at him because of his ability to have direct
access to the Undersecretary, despite his junior civil service status. In 1957 Harry J. Reed, retired
Dean of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University, was hired to be the Coordinator of Rural
Development. Doherty, however, continued to do all of the day-to-day work and saw Reed, who
spent most of his time giving speeches outside of Washington, DC, only a few times. Garland
Marshall took over from Reed in 1959. He had more direct involvement in the program but
Doherty continued to do most of work until the end of the Eisenhower Administration.15
Morse inaugurated the program by holding several regional conferences at which the
