True D. Morse and the Beginning of the Post War Rural Development Work 3
labor. He reasoned that: "When farm processing becomes general, many will not have to leave
their farms for extra work. If they do not have their own farm factory they may find employment
in that of a neighbor's."1
The idea that farmers should become involved in the processing of their own crops,
beyond churning butter for home use and grinding feed, etc., was a visionary suggestion that was
never implemented, perhaps because Morse and others never foresaw how it was to be
accomplished. According to Thomas Hady, a USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) rural
development economist from 1965 to 1993, such plans did not exist in 1965, when it was
common to talk about home-based industry but not processing farm products. “If expanded
secondary processing of farm-grown commodities was his program at that time, I think it is a
fascinating step in the development of rural development thinking.”2
Morse also foresaw the need to increase the amount of nonagricultural industry in rural
communities, but spoke of this more as an afterthought than as a centerpiece of his proposal.
Implicit in the Dallas speech was his belief that agriculture was still the overwhelmingly
dominant rural industry, but the brief mention of the role of nonagricultural industry anticipated
the expanded approach to rural development that was implemented in the 1950s.
Finally, Morse reminded his listeners that the objective of economic development was to
enhance the health, recreational, religious, domestic, and governmental aspects of rural life:
"Increasing the earnings of the people in an area is only a means to an end, not an end in itself."3
Morse's speech circulated widely, and in 1947 business leaders in Tupelo, MS, led by
Tupelo Daily Journal publisher George A. McLean, called on him to draft a plan for their area.
According to Morse, "Tupelo businessmen raised $30,000 a year out of their own pockets to
assist farmers in overhauling their rickety farms."4 Morse told them that the development of any
trade area "ought to be pretty much as you approach the effective planning and development of a
farm. After all these rural towns are pretty much the economic center of a big farm." They spent
the next year formulating the plan and then moved "aggressively" to implement it. The contents
of this plan are not known but apparently it was very successful because Morse reported that
soon after its implementation Tupelo's business activity was increasing twice as fast as the State
average and that "delegations from hard-pressed counties in 23 States visited Tupelo, and some
returned home to put similar programs into operation as quickly as possible."5
In 1949 business leaders in Asheville, NC raised $250,000 and began a so-called
"Partnership for Progress" program encompassing 16 surrounding counties. Again, they called
on Morse to draft a plan for their area, and within a year it began to experience the same kind of
economic growth as Tupelo. The success of these programs convinced Morse that local initiative
and self-help were the most powerful engines of rural development.6 In the meantime a few
people in the Federal Government were trying to revive interest in the rural poverty problem,
which had been temporarily obscured by wartime demand for farm products and labor shortages.
Secretary Brannan Anticipates the Great Society
In the presidential campaign of 1948 Secretary of Agriculture Charles Brannan had been
instrumental in "delivering" much of the Midwestern farm vote to President Truman.
Encouraged by his high standing within the administration, Brannan hoped to persuade Congress
to support his efforts to alleviate rural poverty.
In 1949 Brannan appeared before the Low-Income Subcommittee of the Joint Committee
