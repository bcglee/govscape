Federal Rural Development Policy in the Twentieth Century 4
on the Economic Report chaired by Senator John Sparkman of Alabama. He pointed out that,
depending on the criteria used, about one-half of all farm families could be classified as low-
income. According to Brannan, "much more assistance must be rendered to low-income farm
families to complement the programs that are geared more directly to the needs of their more
fortunate brothers." He then analyzed the contributions of individual USDA agencies.
The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) had been created to assist low-income
families, but the limited scale of its operations made it unable to deliver operating and farm
ownership loans to more than a fraction of the eligible farm families who had requested them.
Also, the "very effective special teaching methods" by which FmHA provided low-income
families with farm and home management assistance had never been adequately implemented.
The education services of the Extension Service were theoretically available to all
farmers but, according to Brannan, the "difficulties and problems of carrying on educational
work with low-income farm families are much greater" than with wealthier farmers. The result
was that low-income families received less educational information.
Poor farmers got less assistance from the Farm Credit Administration because they had
"no basis for this type of credit. For them the benefits, at best, are indirect, deriving from the
existence in their communities of cooperative credit institutions or of cooperative associations
financed by them." They were less likely to benefit from soil conservation districts because they
lacked the capital or credit to finance needed conservation measures.
Finally, price support programs benefited low-income farmers, "but usually only to the
extent that they have products to sell. Of course, price supports do not meet the fundamental
problem of the operator who cannot produce a large enough volume to make a good return at any
price."
Brannan asserted that the solution to the problem should be sought within the context of
an expanding national economy so that broader opportunities could be provided both within and
outside of agriculture. Brannan was emphatic that rural poverty should be attacked in a
comprehensive way because we "cannot compartmentalize our thinking or our programs in this
field. We will make a grave mistake if we do not agree upon a consistent overall policy and
provide for cohesive administration of the programs designed to carry out such a policy." He
then outlined three broad programs:
1. A special readjustment or redevelopment program for small farmers who are likely to
continue to find their best opportunity in farming. To accomplish this he asked Congress to
expand FmHA's authority so that it could loan more money at lower and more flexible rates. This
proposal was based on "our experience over the years [which] shows that low-income farm
families can make phenomenal progress if a little opportunity and assistance is made available to
them."
2. Stimulation of further industrial development in underdeveloped rural areas and
special assistance to low-income farm families or persons living on inadequate farms who desire
to engage in nonfarm work either full or part time. The technological revolution in agriculture
made this imperative. According to Brannan: "Full-time or part-time jobs in nonfarm work may
be the best answer to the twofold problem of raising the level of living of some low-income farm
families and contributing to economic stability." Here he agreed with people in the private sector
such as True D. Morse, but with the difference that he wanted a special government agency
created for this purpose, one that "might not necessarily be lodged in the Department of
