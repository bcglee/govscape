Sun Safety,
Compiled by USDA-APHIS-CCEP
The short-term results of unprotected exposure to UV rays are tanning and sunburn.
Sun tanning and sun burns increase the risk of skin cancer so it is important to protect
yourself from the sun's damaging rays.
UV Index
• Indicates the amount of UV (ultraviolet) radiation reaching the earth’s surface
during an hour around noon
• The higher the number the greater the exposure to UV radiation
Sun Safety Tips
• Try to stay in the shade during the heat of the day
• Wear light colored, loose fitting clothing that covers exposed skin
• Wear a wide brimmed hat
• Wear sunglasses with UV protection
• Protect yourself even on a cloudy day—unseen UV rays can still cause damage
• Use a sunscreen with at least SPF 15
• Some drugs & cosmetics—Tetacycline, diuretics, and major tranquilizers—may
increase susceptibility to sunburn because they contain substances that cause the
skin to absorb more of the sun’s radiation; contact your pharmacist or physician
for more information
• A sunscreen’s Sun Protection Factor (SPF) number refers to the
factor by which it enhances a person’s natural sun protection—if
someone normally burns in 20 minutes, then a sunscreen with an SPF of 15
would protect them for 300 minutes (SPF 15 x 20 minutes = 300 minutes)
