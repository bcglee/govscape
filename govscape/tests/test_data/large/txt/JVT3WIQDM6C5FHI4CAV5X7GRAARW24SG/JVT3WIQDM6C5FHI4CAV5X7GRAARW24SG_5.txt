Table 5. Potential C transfer by converting an equal amount (10%) of rainfed moldboard plow land back to native forest or grassland
on a basis of 1 unit of irrigated rainfed agricultural land to 1 unit of native forest or grassland and conversion of equal amount (10%)
of rainfed moldboard plow land back to native forest or grassland on the basis of 1 unit of irrigated rainfed agricultural land to 2
units of native forest or grassland.
