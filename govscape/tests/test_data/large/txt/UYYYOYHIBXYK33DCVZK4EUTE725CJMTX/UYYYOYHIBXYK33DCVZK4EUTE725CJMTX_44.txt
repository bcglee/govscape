Appendix C
Import Alerts and Pathogen Data
Salmonella
Two import alerts were frequently mentioned in association with refusals
for Salmonella violations for fi shery and seafood products. Import alert
16-18 calls for detention without physical examination (DWPE) of all fresh,
frozen, and raw shrimp from Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Taiwan,
and Thailand due to problems with Salmonella, decomposition, and fi lth
(shrimp from India are treated separately in import alert 16-35). Import alert
16-81 calls for DWPE of multiple seafood products from a list of fi rms and
countries that do not readily fi t into previously existing import alerts. Import
alerts are added, revised, and deleted as deemed necessary by FDA. For
example, import alerts 16-56, 16-65, and 16-70 were canceled once they were
condensed into import alert 16-81. Some alerts specifi ed in the Salmonella-
fi shery/seafood data calling for DWPE cover all frozen raw fi sh from
Thailand (16-17), specifi c types of raw molluscan seafood from specifi c fi rms
and shippers (16-50), and frog legs from specifi c shippers (16-12).
Of the Salmonella violations for spices, fl avors, and salts, two commonly
mentioned import alerts in the text variable called for DWPE for all ship-
ments of black pepper from India (28-02) and all shipments of whole and
cracked black and white pepper from Brazil (28-04). Import alert 99-19
is broad based and covers a wide range of food products found to contain
Salmonella from specifi c manufacturers and shippers in multiple countries
(excluding black pepper covered in the previously mentioned import alerts
28-02 and 28-04, coconut in import alert 23-12, and seafood under import
alerts specifi cally for seafood). In particular, 99-19 is an extensive 60-page
document that lists fi rms facing DWPE because of historical problems with
Salmonella in shipments of many types of spices, fruits, vegetables, and
exotic meats.
Another broad-based import alert (99-23) was mentioned frequently in the
text comments. This alert called for DWPE of raw/fresh and raw/fresh/refrig-
erated fruits and vegetables due to a history of one or more types of patho-
genic contamination. This import alert specifi es four OASIS violation codes:
those for Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, and a general category of bacteria.
Obviously, there is not a one-to-one link between an import alert and a viola-
tion for a pathogen. Also, note that multiple pathogens may be present on
a food at the same time. Fresh produce was identifi ed in 1997 as an area of
concern in President Clinton’s “Food Safety Initiative,” and this alert calls for
DWPE of specifi c fruits and vegetables from specifi c growers, manufacturers,
and shippers. For example, DWPE of shipments of cantaloup, green onions,
broccoli (Rapini), cilantro, and culantro from particular fi rms in Costa Rica
and Mexico were on the DWPE list due to past problems with Salmonella.
Another import alert (22-01) was added as a result of multi-state outbreaks in
2000, 2001, and 2002 from Mexican cantaloup contaminated with
Salmonella. This import alert calls for DWPE of all fresh, frozen, and
processed (including chopped or sliced for salad bars), or frozen cantaloup
