Summary
Interest in the safety of imported foods has increased over time, not only
because the volume of food imports is increasing in the United States, but
because the imported share of the total U.S. food consumption is also rising,
particularly for perishable, minimally processed foods. Food safety concerns
about food imports may have far-reaching implications—reducing demand
for certain imported products, altering international food trade patterns, and
limiting access to U.S. markets for some foreign exporters.
What Is the Issue?
Data limitations constrain what is known about the safety of imported foods.
As a fi rst step to understanding this issue better, ERS researchers analyzed
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refusals of food import ship-
ments for 1998-2004 by food industry group and by type of violation. Here,
the term violations refers to products that appear to violate one or more
of the laws enforced by FDA, such as those dealing with adulterated or
misbranded products.
What Did the Study Find?
The study revealed recurring food safety risks and other problems (e.g., inad-
equate labeling) in certain types of imported foods. The fi ndings, however, do
not indicate the actual level or distribution of food safety risk that imports may
pose to American consumers because FDA’s process for selecting shipments
for inspection or other administrative actions is not random. Instead, FDA
relies on risk-based criteria to guide its actions, including data on products and
manufacturers with a history of violating U.S. import regulations. In essence,
import refusals highlight food safety problems that appear to recur in trade and
where the FDA has focused its import alerts and monitoring efforts.
The top imported food categories refused due to food safety and other viola-
tions under FDA law were:
1. Vegetables and vegetable products (accounting for 20.6 percent of
total violations);
2. Fishery and seafood products (20.1 percent); and
3. Fruits and fruit products (11.7 percent).
An examination of violations in these three categories reveals that refusals
for sanitary violations in seafood and fruit products, pesticide violations in
vegetables, and unregistered processes for canned food products in all three
categories were persistent over time (fi g. 1).
Of the 70,369 violations reported from 1998 to 2004, 33 percent were for
misbranding or the lack of appropriate labeling and 65 percent were for
adulteration or safety and packaging integrity problems (e.g., leaky
containers/swollen cans may suggest the presence of microbial growth).
Adulteration violations pose a wide range of food safety risks, from less
severe risks, such as an insect in cooked soup, to immediate risks to human
