1Total violations are for adulteration, misbranding, and 1,356 “other violations” not shown here (i.e., less than 2 percent of total violations), such as
items forbidden or restricted in sale.
2Meats have very few refusals, presumably due to the pre-certifi cation of inspection systems in exporting countries carried out by USDA/FSIS and
mandated by the U.S. food safety legislation specifi c to meat and poultry and because these refusals only include FDA-regulated meat and poultry
products (see box, “Food Safety Oversight in the United States,” p. 3).
3Filled milk is skim milk that has been reconstituted with fats from nondairy sources, such as palm oil or coconut oil.
