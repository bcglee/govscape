Shigella was the only other pathogen with its own violation code in the
sample. Of the 48 violations for Shigella, 37 were for vegetables and vege-
table products, and 11 were for fruits and fruit products. Of the vegetable
violations, 31 were for celery, largely in response to an import alert calling
for a DWPE for shipments from listed manufacturers, shippers, and growers
due to historical problems (see Appendix C).
There were 280 violations for the general group of bacteria (i.e.,
BACTERIA), 61.8 percent of which were linked to cheese and cheese
products and 26.8 percent linked to fi shery and seafood products. The text
comments for these observations frequently listed the name of a single
pathogen or their toxins, such as Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli, Salmonella,
Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin,
Clostridium botulinum, Norwalk virus, Enterobacter sakazakii,13 and 13Enterobacter sakazakii can cause
Bacillus cereus, or more general terms like bacteria or coliforms. Alkaline meningitis and septicemia. Most
cases involved infants, perhaps due to
phosphatase was mentioned occasionally in the same comment with E. coli.
powdered milk-based infant formulas
Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme produced by bacteria, and its presence in
contaminated with this pathogen (FDA,
bovine milk indicates that milk has not been properly pasteurized. Aug. 2002).
Afl atoxin (a specifi c type of mycotoxin) is a carcinogenic byproduct of mold
infestations in food crops. Of the 241 violations for afl atoxin, 42.7 percent
were for the nonchocolate candy group and 32.4 percent were for nuts and
edible seeds. Many of the nonchocolate candy products contained the nuts
and seeds susceptible to afl atoxin contamination.
In summary, the pathogens identifi ed in import refusal violations were found
in food vehicles typically associated with such risks. More information about
import alerts associated with specifi c pathogens is found in Appendix C.
Most Common Violations by FDA Food Industry Group
Table 7 presents the most common violation for each industry group, with
industry groups ranked by total number of violations. Vegetables and vege-
table products have the largest total number of violations; unsafe pesticide
residues were the most cited reason. Violations include chemical residues
not registered in the United States or residues that exceed tolerance levels
set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The FDA provides addi-
