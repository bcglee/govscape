Abstract
This report examines U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data on refusals of
food offered for importation into the United States from 1998 to 2004. Although the data
do not necessarily refl ect the distribution of risk in foods, the study found that import
refusals highlight food safety problems that appear to recur in trade and where the FDA
has focused its import alerts, examinations (e.g., sampling), and other monitoring efforts.
The data show some food industries and types of violations are consistent sources of
problems both over time and in comparison with previous studies of more limited data.
The three food industry groups with the most violations were vegetables (20.6 percent of
total violations), fi shery and seafood (20.1 percent), and fruits (11.7 percent). Violations
observed over the entire time period include sanitary issues in seafood and fruit prod-
ucts, unsafe pesticide residues in vegetables, and unregistered processes for canned food
products in all three industries.
