1One observation in the nuts and edible seeds group did not specify the violation.
2Meats have very few refusals, presumably due to the pre-certifi cation of inspection systems in exporting countries carried out by USDA/FSIS
and mandated by the U.S. food safety legislation specifi c to meat and poultry and because the data only cover FDA-regulated meat and poultry
products (see box, “Food Safety Oversight in the United States,” p. 3).
3There was a tie for the most common charge for this group between: (1) manufacturer of a low-acid canned food or an acidifi ed food failed to fi le
information on its scheduled process (NO PROCESS) and (2) the manufacturer was not registered as a low-acid canned food or acidifi ed food
manufacturer.
