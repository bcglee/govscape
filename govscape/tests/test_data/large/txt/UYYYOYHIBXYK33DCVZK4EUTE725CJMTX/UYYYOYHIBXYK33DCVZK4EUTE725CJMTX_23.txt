Future Analysis
For FDA-regulated food products, ERS plans to examine the relationship
between import refusals and the volume of trade and type of exporter (i.e.,
level of economic development), and the relationship between types of
violations, country of origin, and product characteristics. A future study will
analyze violations within fruits and vegetables, since vegetable, seafood, and
fruit groups were the three product categories with the most import violations
from 1998 to 2004. We did not consider further investigation of seafood,
since seafood import detentions were previously investigated in detail by
Allshouse et al. (2003).
