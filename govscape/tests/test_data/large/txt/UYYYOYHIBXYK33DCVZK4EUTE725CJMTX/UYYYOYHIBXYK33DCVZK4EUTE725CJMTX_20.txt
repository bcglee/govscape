tional information about the nature of pesticide residue violations in domestic
and imported produce for 2002 and 2003 (FDA, 2002; FDA, 2003). In both
2002 and 2003, more violations occurred in imported produce for unregis-
tered pesticide residues than for violative residues that exceed U.S. tolerance
levels. Unregistered chemicals may or may not pose health risks; they may
be unregistered because they are not used in American production and thus
vendors have not submitted data to support registration.
In fi shery and seafood products and fruits and fruit products, the industry
groups with the second and third largest numbers of total violations, fi lthy was
the most common violation. Unsafe coloring was the most common violation
for candy (excluding chocolate and gum), bakery products, and soft drinks.
These most common violations refl ect in part the nature of the products in
different industry groups, including degree of processing.
Pathogens posing more immediate risks to human health appear as the most
common reason for industry groups with far fewer violations. Salmonella
contamination was the most common violation for the meat group and the
spices, fl avors, and salts group. Meat, poultry, and their miscellaneous prod-
ucts have very few FDA import refusals since inspection and certifi cation of
most of these products are under FSIS jurisdiction (see box, “Food Safety
Oversight in the United States,” p. 3). Listeria contamination was the most
common violation for cheese and cheese products.
The most common violation for many other industry groups occurred when
the manufacturer failed to fi le information on their scheduled process, when
the article was fi lthy, an unsafe coloring was used, or when the article did not
have the required nutritional information on its label.
The persistence of certain violations over time provides insight into which
food safety issues are recurring. Table 8 shows the top three violations from
1998 to 2004 for the three industry groups with the greatest total violations.
The top three reasons are consistent for vegetables and vegetable products
and account for over half of all violations every year. Unsafe pesticide
residues and process violations are the most persistent violations for this
industry group. Fishery and seafood product violations are also consistent
over time, with fi lthy, Salmonella, and process violations accounting for
over half of all violations each year. Fruits and fruit product violations
occurred most frequently due to a fi lthy designation, but the second and third
most common reasons varied. Unsafe pesticide residues, processing viola-
tions, and inadequate nutrition labeling are most important from 2002 to
2004, while the relative importance of violations due to unsafe coloring and
additives has diminished.
The persistence of the same top violations in the IRR data through 2004
suggests that there may be unresolved food safety management issues
surrounding the wholesomeness of fi shery and seafood products and fruit
products, as well as unsafe pesticide residues and processing violations in
horticultural products (both vegetables and fruits). Sanitary issues in seafood
and pesticide issues in vegetables were also identifi ed in previous studies as
areas of concern in food imports. In addition to these previously identifi ed
issues, failure to fi le information on scheduled processes was also a signifi -
cant reason for refusals.
