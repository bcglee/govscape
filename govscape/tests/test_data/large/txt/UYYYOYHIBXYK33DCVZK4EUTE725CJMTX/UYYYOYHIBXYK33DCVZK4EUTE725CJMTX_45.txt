from Mexico. The import alert lists a handful of fi rms exempt from DWPE
and lists fi rms certifi ed as being compliant with good agricultural practices
under a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding with Mexico.1 1 The FDA signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) with the

regarding import alerts for DWPE of soft cheese (soft and soft ripened) made into the United States (FDA, IA22-01,

(12-07). Of the fi shery and seafood violations for Listeria, many were
processed seafood and analogue seafood (i.e., surimi) products under import
alert 16-39 since these products are intended to be eaten without further heat
treatment or with minimal heating insuffi cient to destroy Listeria, if present.
Additionally, there has been an ongoing problem with Listeria in avocado
products from Mexico since June 1993 when an importer’s frozen guacamole
was tested by the FDA and found positive for Listeria (FDA, IA 21-12,
Feb. 3, 2006). Import alerts were initially put in place in 1993 for guacamole
and avocado pulp whereby districts may detain, without physical sampling
and analysis (i.e., DWPE), avocado products from specifi c fi rms. Later, the
import alert was expanded to include additional fi rms and other frozen and
refrigerated avocado products.
Histamine
Of the histamine violations, import alert 16-05 for all raw, fresh, or frozen
mahi-mahi shipments was commonly mentioned in the text comments. This
import alert calls for DWPE on imports from Ecuador and Taiwan and inten-
sifi ed coverage of imports from all countries except Japan (excluding ship-
pers listed as exempt in the import alert). A second import alert (16-105),
calls for DWPE of all seafood and seafood products from certain fi rms,
except for select products covered in other import alerts. In particular, this
import alert mentioned several fi rms in Indonesia and Vietnam with a history
of problems with histamine and decomposition in tuna shipments.
Shigella
Of the Shigella violations, 31 were for celery and appear to be largely in
response to import alert 99-23. This import alert calls for a DWPE of over
a dozen raw/fresh and raw/fresh/refrigerated fruits and vegetables from
listed manufacturers, shippers, and growers due to the presence of pathogen
contamination, which may include Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, or other
bacteria. Fresh cantaloup was the most common fruit with the Shigella
violation code, which fell under import alert 99-23.
“Bacteria”
The majority of import alerts mentioned in the narrative text for viola-
tions with the general bacteria violation code (i.e., BACTERIA) have been
covered above. Additionally, import alert 16-13 calls for a DWPE on ancho-
