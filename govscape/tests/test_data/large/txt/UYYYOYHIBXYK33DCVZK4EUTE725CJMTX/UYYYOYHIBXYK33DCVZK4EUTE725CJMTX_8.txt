Food Safety Oversight in the United States
In the United States, there are three main regulatory agencies with
Federal jurisdiction over food and food ingredients:
(cid:129) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) within the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) ensures the safety of all
domestic and imported meat (except game and exotic meats),
poultry, and processed egg products.
(cid:129) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has in its purview all
domestic and imported foods marketed in interstate commerce as
well as game and exotic meats (e.g., kangaroo, quail, and duck),
food additives, animal feed, and veterinary drugs. As noted
above, the exception is for meat, poultry, and processed egg prod-
ucts regulated by FSIS. FDA-regulated meat and poultry prod-
ucts include products that contain less than 2 percent cooked or 3
percent raw meat by volume. FDA allows FDA-regulated meat,
poultry, or egg products only from an approved source.
(cid:129) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) licenses pesticide
products and establishes maximum allowable limits (tolerances)
for pesticide residues in food and animal feed. (FDA and FSIS
enforce pesticide tolerances for the commodities under their
jurisdiction.) In addition, EPA manages regulatory and research
programs related to water- and foodborne toxic chemicals such as
dioxin (President’s Council on Food Safety, 2001).
The food safety efforts of these agencies are supported by a number
of other government organizations, including State, tribal, and local
governments. FDA is responsible for all import inspections except
for meat, poultry, and processed egg products, which fall under FSIS
jurisdiction. Responsibility for particular food groups is often shared
among agencies. For example, for fruits and vegetables, EPA and
USDA share pesticide regulation responsibilities, while FDA handles
import inspections.
The FDA’s mission is to enforce the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and other laws designed to protect consumer
health, safety, and welfare (FDA, March 17, 1999). These laws apply
equally to domestic and imported products. All food under FDA juris-
diction, as defi ned in the FD&C and related Acts, is subject to exami-
nation by FDA when it is being imported or offered for import into
the United States. Imported foods must be pure, wholesome, safe to
eat, produced under sanitary conditions, and contain informative and
truthful labeling in English.
