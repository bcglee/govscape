country. In some instances, an alert places a grower/product on detention
without physical examination (DWPE) (FDA, March 17, 1999). This means
subsequent shipments will be refused entry into U.S. commerce unless the
importer presents evidence (via testing or other means) to FDA proving the
item can overcome the appearance of a violation (FDA, Feb. 1, 2008; FDA,
CFSAN, Feb./March 2002). This procedure is based on past history and/or
other information indicating the product may be violative or when violative
fi ndings for a grower/shipper are of a nature that suggests future shipments
from that grower/shipper may also be in violation (FDA, CFSAN, Feb./
March 2002).
The purpose of import alerts are to:
1. Prevent products that appear to be violative from coming into the
country, based on factual evidence;
2. Free up Agency resources to look at other commodities of high-risk;
and
3. Place the responsibility of importing products that are in compliance
with the law back on the importer.
The agency cannot inspect each shipment, but instead relies on risk-based
criteria to choose which shipments to examine (e.g., sampling, label review)
and which food safety and other problems to post as import alerts. These
examinations and import alerts may lead to import refusals. Therefore, IRR
are not a result of a random sample. The IRR refl ect the FDA’s criteria for
shipments to examine, refusals as a result of FDA’s import alerts, and other
factors, such as newly identifi ed issues in food imports. In essence, to an
important yet unquantifi able extent, IRR data reveal where the FDA has
focused its efforts (e.g., developing and disseminating specifi c import alerts)
and/or resources (e.g., choosing shipments to examine) in response to identi-
fi ed problems.
We identifi ed this connection between import alerts and refusals in two ways.
First, an examination of FDA import alerts posted on the FDA Web site
on July 23, 2007, showed that FDA industry groups with the most import
alerts are basically the same groups with the most refusals in the 1998-2004
IRR data (see Appendix B). This is an imperfect comparison, because there
is no way to identify which import alerts would have been in effect at any
particular time during the timeframe of our sample (1998 to 2004). Second,
the narrative text variable in refusal data provides comments for roughly 70
percent of all observations, and import alerts are frequently mentioned. There
is no guarantee, however, that an import alert would have been specifi ed in
the text comment each time an alert was associated with a particular ship-
ment. Thus, while a connection between import alerts and refusals seems to
exist, Kendall (2007) reported that it is not possible to determine defi nitively
whether an import refusal was caused by a particular import alert solely from
the IRR data. Therefore, we cannot determine the volume or share of viola-
tions or refusals linked to import alerts or DWPE.
