Analysis of the IRR Data
Import Shipments Refused by the FDA
During 1998-2004, we found that 49,448 shipments were refused entry into
U.S. markets by FDA (table 2). There were roughly twice as many refused
shipments in each of the last 3 years of the data than in each of the previous
4 years. Some of this growth may refl ect the strengthening of the reporting
system in later years, such as greater use of the OASIS electronic entry
submission system, processing, and admissibility determinations (before
OASIS, paper submissions were required for all shipments). It also refl ects
the increased volume of food shipments. FDA’s Food Protection Plan esti-
mated that in FY2007, there were 9.5 million food entries (i.e., shipments of
food), up from around 3 million in FY1997 (FDA, Nov. 2007, p. 8).7 7 The Food Protection Plan defi nes

Adulteration, Misbranding, and Other Violations
The FDA separates most import violations into two main categories: adul-
teration and misbranding. As defi ned in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
the term adulteration involves the content of a product, such as the addition
of a substance that makes it inferior, impure, or not genuine (FDA, March 17,
1999). For our purposes, adulteration deals with safety, packaging integrity,
or sanitation (Caswell and Wang, 2001). Misbranding includes untruthful
or misleading statements on labels and labeling and includes products
missing appropriate labeling or packaging. According to FDA, many of the
misbranding issues may have arisen from products that were analyzed for
sanitary issues (e.g., foodborne pathogens).
The severity of the risk posed by shipments charged with misbranding and
adulteration varies. For example, a misbranding violation from a nonstandard
nutrient label may not pose health risks, whereas a misbranding violation for
undeclared sulfi tes may pose risks to sulfi te-sensitive consumers. Similarly,
adulteration violations for obvious rat fi lth in raw produce may pose higher
health risks than the same circumstance in cooked produce, although both are
unacceptable.
Of all import violations from 1998 to 2004, we calculate that 65 percent were
for adulteration, 33 percent were for misbranding, and 2 percent were for
