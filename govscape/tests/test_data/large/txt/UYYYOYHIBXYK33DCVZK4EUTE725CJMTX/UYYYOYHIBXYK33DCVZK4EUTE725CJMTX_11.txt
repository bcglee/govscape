Limitations of the IRR Data
To interpret the IRR data, it is important to understand the limitations of
the data:
• FDA inspections cover a small percent of food import entries (about 1
percent in FY2000 (GAO, Oct. 10, 2001)). The FDA sampled 2.1 percent
or less of seafood shipments for sensory examination or laboratory
inspection between 2003 and 2006 (Food & Water Watch, 2007). We
do not have precise numbers on the percent of food shipments inspected
by the FDA or data on the other food industry groups for the other years
covered in the sample.
• The IRR data are not a result of a random sampling of imports. For
example, as discussed, the IRR tend to refl ect those growers, shippers, or
commodities identifi ed by FDA through their import alert system as more
likely to be in violation.
• IRR data do not provide information on the total number of food ship-
ments offered to FDA for admission (i.e., entries) into U.S. commerce for
the years covered in our sample. We cannot, therefore, calculate the share
of shipments refused entry.
• FDA data on shipment quantity/weight are inappropriate to calculate
either the total amount or volume of food products rejected by FDA
for entry into U.S. commerce or to calculate the share of refusals out of
total imports. The data are incomplete. For example, a shipment could
be declared in pounds, gallons, or count (e.g., 50 jars, 100 cartons),
precluding meaningful aggregations.6 6 Quantity is not a required data

tion on the problems that occur in food imports in terms of meeting standards
for entry into U.S. markets. The subsample of IRR observations categorized
as adulteration (e.g., sanitation, safety, and packaging integrity problems
such as swollen or leaky containers) provide a partial view of the food
vehicle and safety problems in imports that appear to pose food safety risks
to human health. The recurrence of particular violations over time shows
where food imports have persistent failures in meeting U.S. standards.
