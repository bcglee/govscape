of chemical contamination violations. FILTHY is the most common viola-
tion code in “other sanitary violations,” accounting for 40.4 percent of these
violations. Two unregistered processes for low-acid canned foods or acidifi ed
foods (previously mentioned) combined accounted for another 49.3 percent
of the “other adulterations” (e.g., NEEDS FCE and NO PROCESS). Thus,
adulteration violations tend to be concentrated in particular violation codes.
Pathogen Adulteration Violations
Pathogens pose clearly identifi able risks to human health, and we examine
next which pathogens are most important in violations and on particular food
vehicles. The 7,054 adulteration violations classifi ed as pathogens are broken
down in table 4. Note that food safety risks to human health from these
pathogens vary and some of these risks are avoidable with safe food
handling procedures.
Salmonella was the most common pathogen adulteration violation,
accounting for 63 percent of the total number of pathogen adulteration viola-
tions. Salmonella is a naturally occurring pathogen sometimes found in a
wide variety of live fi sh, animals, and birds, both domestically and interna-
tionally. Listeria ranked second with 24.8 percent. Five violations equaled
4 percent or less of the total: histamine, afl atoxin, Shigella, a general group
for bacteria (i.e., BACTERIA), and another general category for shipments
that appear to be, in whole or part, the product of a diseased animal or from
an animal which died by means other than slaughter (i.e., DISEASED).12 12Note that some pathogens do not

1The text comments for “bacteria” violations frequently listed the name of a single pathogen,
such as Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, Staphylococcus aureus,
Staphylococcal enterotoxin, Clostridium botulinum, Norwalk virus, Enterobacter sakazakii, and
Bacillus cereus, or more general terms like bacteria or coliforms.
