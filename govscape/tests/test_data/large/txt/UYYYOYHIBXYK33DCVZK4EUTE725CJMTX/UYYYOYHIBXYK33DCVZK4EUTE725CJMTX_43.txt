appropriate corrective measures. Occasionally, the FDA identifi es products
from an entire country or geographic region for DWPE when violative condi-
tions appear to be geographically widespread. Detention recommendations
of this breadth are rare and initiated only after other avenues for resolving the
problem have been exhausted.
Computerization
To ensure the expeditious handling of imported products, FDA automated
its import operations. By combining FDA’s Operational and Administrative
System for Import Support (OASIS) and CBP’s Automated Commercial
System (ACS), an FDA reviewer is able to effi ciently evaluate and process
each import entry. The import fi ler transmits the required shipment-specifi c
FDA data into the ACS. Within a few minutes, the fi ler receives notifi ca-
tion that either their shipment has been released or the FDA wishes to review
it. This system provides the FDA with immediate data on imported prod-
ucts, information on potential problems, and maintains national historic data
fi les to develop profi les on specifi c products, shippers, and manufacturers.
Eventually, all fi lers processing entries through ACS will provide FDA with
information electronically.
In addition to required entry forms, certain products require shippers to
present specifi c information to FDA at time of importation. For example,
foreign fi rms must register and fi le processing information before shipping
any low-acid canned food or acidifi ed low-acid canned food to the United
States. The Federal Import Milk Act also requires a permit for milk and
cream (including sweetened condensed milk) imported into the United States.

Administration, Offi ce of Regulatory Affairs, “Import Program System Information,”
March 17, 1999, www.cfsan.fda./~lrd/imp-info.html. At the time of publication, it was
diffi cult to fi nd adequate documentation of the import process on the FDA Web site. In
particular, chapters of the FDA’s Web manual, which is also called “Import Program
System Information” (www.fda.gov/ora/import/ora_import_system.html), were unavail-
able because they were under revision. The most up-to-date information can be found
in the “Inspection Operations Manual, 2007,” which is the primary guidance document
on FDA inspection policy and procedures for fi eld investigators and inspectors (www.
fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/iom/). Another important document, “FDA Import Procedures”
(www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/import.html) was published in 1996. It is currently being
reviewed in light of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and
Response Act of 2002, which became effective December 12, 2003. For specifi c
information on U.S. Customs procedures, requirements, and forms, see CBP, Dec. 5,
2006. Administrative and legislative changes are always under consideration (CBP,
Dec. 5, 2006). Therefore, the information on the import process described is subject to
change and should be considered as background only. For detailed, current informa-
tion, we suggest readers contact the FDA or CBP directly.
