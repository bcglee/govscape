Pathogen, Chemical, and Other Adulteration Violations
Adulteration violations were examined in depth, as we believe they were
more likely to be associated with food safety risks than misbranding or “other
violations.” Three subcategories of adulteration violations were created to
increase our understanding of potential food safety problems (table 3):
1. Pathogens, such as Salmonella, and their toxins, such as mycotoxins;
2. Chemical contamination with pesticides or unapproved additives;
and
3. “Other sanitary violations” including fi lthy or decomposed appear- 11 We classifi ed pathogen viola-
