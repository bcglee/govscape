Note: The list of active import alerts is constantly changing. Therefore, this list represents one snapshot in time.

Detention Without Physical Examination
When import alerts call for a detention without physical examination
(DWPE), this means subsequent entry lines for a grower/product will be
refused entry into U.S. commerce unless the importer presents evidence, such
as test results, to FDA proving the item meets safety requirements (FDA,
CFSAN, Feb./March 2002). This procedure is an administrative act based on
past history and/or other information indicating the product may be violative
or when violative fi ndings for a grower/shipper are of a nature that suggests
future entry lines from that grower/shipper may also be in violation (FDA,
CFSAN, Feb./March 2002). DWPE is imposed to protect consumers from
potentially contaminated subsequent entry lines until the fi rm implements
