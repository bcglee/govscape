Discussion
Our primary goals were to identify what the FDA import refusal data repre-
sent, which sanitary issues and other violations were most common, how
such violations were distributed among different industry groups, and which
violations were most persistent over time.
The IRR data have a number of limitations, thus inferences from data must
be made with caution. Nevertheless, the IRR provide insight into food
safety problems in food imports. And because the data span a 7-year time
frame, the analysis also provides insight into where persistent failures in
food safety management potentially appear in international food production,
processing, and trade. The sampling strategies by the FDA and other agen-
cies are designed to focus enforcement and inspection efforts on areas that
have the highest probability of risk (Ahmed, 1991). Import refusals highlight
food safety problems that appear to recur in trade (i.e., the FDA thought they
would be a problem and they are) and where the FDA has focused its import
alerts and monitoring efforts.
The IRR from 1998 to 2004 show consistency in the food industries and
violation types that occur both over time and in comparison with previous
studies of more limited detention data. We found that the three food groups
with the most violations during 1998-2004 were vegetables and vegetable
products (20.6 percent of total violations), fi shery and seafood products (20.1
percent), and fruits and fruit products (11.7 percent). Of the 70,369 viola-
tions, 65 percent were for adulteration and 33 percent were for misbranding.
The most common adulteration violations were for the appearance of fi lth
in a food product or for failures to fi le information or register a specifi ed
process. When specifi c pathogens were identifi ed in import refusals, they
tended to be found in food products typically associated with such risks.
An examination of violations in the top three industry groups revealed that
refusals for sanitary violations in seafood and fruits, pesticide violations in
vegetables, and unregistered processes in all three industries were persistent
over time.
