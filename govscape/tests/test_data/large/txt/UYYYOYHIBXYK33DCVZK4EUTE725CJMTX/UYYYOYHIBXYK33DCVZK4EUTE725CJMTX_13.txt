1Meats have very few refusals, presumably due to the pre-certifi cation of inspection systems in exporting countries carried out by USDA/FSIS and
mandated by U.S. food safety legislation specifi c to meat and poultry and because the data only cover FDA-regulated meat and poultry products
(see box, “Food Safety Oversight in the United States,” p. 3).
2Filled milk is skim milk that has been reconstituted with fats from nondairy sources, such as palm oil or coconut oil.
