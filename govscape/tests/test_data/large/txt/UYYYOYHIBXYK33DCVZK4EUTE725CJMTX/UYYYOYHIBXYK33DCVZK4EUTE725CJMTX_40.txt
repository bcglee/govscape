APPENDIX B
General Procedures for the FDA’s Import Program
To ensure that the FDA is notifi ed of all regulated products imported into the
United States, the importer or his/her representative (i.e., broker or importer
of record), must fi le an entry notice and bond with U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) pending a decision regarding the admissibility of the
product (FDA, March 17, 1999). FDA inspection and enforcement proce-
dures for imports rely on coordination with Customs with whom the FDA has
a longstanding working relationship.
Customs has two general categories of review for foods: formal and informal
entries. Formal entries are generally necessary for food imports valued at
more than $2,500 and require a broker-facilitated entry whereby the broker
posts a bond in case the importer does not follow through on its obligations
for any potential duties, taxes, and charges accrued (i.e., the bond is collat-
eral). Informal entries for food shipments include shipments of food prod-
ucts valued at less than $2,500 and include importers with established track
records and those who pose relatively low risk (e.g., small shipments of
tortillas from Mexico) (Customs, June 29, 2007).
Most food imported into the United States for resale are formal entries, which
must fi rst undergo Custom’s clearance and FDA review. The FDA is noti-
fi ed by CBP of the entry; FDA then performs an electronic document review
to ensure that the shipment contains the necessary information and makes
a decision as to the article’s admissibility. If the FDA does not wish to
examine the entry, the product proceeds into U.S. commerce.
Generally, if FDA decides to examine an entry, an FDA representative will
collect a sample from the shipment for evaluation. During an FDA fi eld
examination, an FDA representative performs a physical, sensory examina-
tion on a product for such things as rodent or insect activity, inadequate
refrigeration, and label compliance to support a specifi c decision (FDA,
Feb. 8, 2007). This FDA representative may be FDA personnel, contractors
hired by FDA, or CBP under a prearranged agreement. The fi eld examina-
tion may be conducted on products discharged from vessels onto the wharves
(piers); pier sheds; from products in trains, trucks, freezers, and containers at
border entry points (i.e., land, air, or sea); or on products set aside for FDA
examination (FDA, Feb. 8, 2007).
In addition to catching obvious contamination, a fi eld examination may
also uncover an unusual color that might trigger a lab analysis to test for
illegal color additives. A label examination is the only valid fi eld examina-
tion to determine if the article is in compliance with mandatory labeling
requirements, such as required nutrition labeling (FDA, Feb. 8, 2007). Field
examinations may not be used for suspected microbiological contamination
or for pesticides, industrial chemicals, afl atoxins, and other toxic elements
(FDA, Feb. 8, 2007). Lab testing is required to detect the presence of these
adulterants. During a fi eld examination, FDA personnel follow FDA’s
Investigations Operations Manual (FDA, Feb. 8, 2007).
