Introduction
Global food trade is expanding due to improvements in transportation,
infrastructure, marketing networks and consumer demand. Trade is also
increasing due to global increases in per capita income and population. Along
with growth in international food trade, food safety has become progres-
sively important to industry, consumers, and policymakers, particularly in
developed countries. Policymakers are experiencing more pressure to guard
or enhance the safety of their nations’ food supplies. The globalization of the
food supply means new food safety risks can be introduced into countries
(e.g., emerging bacteria), previously controlled risks can be re-introduced
into countries (e.g., cholera), and contaminated food can be spread across
greater geographic areas, causing illness worldwide. Food safety concerns
may reduce demand for certain products, alter international food trade
patterns, and limit market access for some exporters.
In the United States, food imports made up 16 percent of all foods consumed
in 2004 (table 1). Import shares are higher for some foods that are often
linked to microbial foodborne illness. An analysis of 5,000 foodborne
illness outbreaks between 1990 and 2004 found that the food categories
linked to most outbreaks (excluding multi-ingredient foods) were seafood,
produce, poultry, beef, and eggs (CSPI, 2006). Imported fi sh and shellfi sh
account for 80 percent of U.S. consumption, while imported fruits and nuts
account for 33.9 percent of U.S. consumption (Jerardo, 2004). On the other
hand, imported red meat accounts for 10.4 percent of U.S. consumption
and imported animal products, as a group, account for 5.6 percent of U.S.
consumption.
