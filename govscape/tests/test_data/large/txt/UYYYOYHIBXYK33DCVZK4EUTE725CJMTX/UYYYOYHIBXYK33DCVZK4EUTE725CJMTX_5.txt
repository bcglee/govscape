health, like botulism in canned food. The data indicate that the most common
adulteration violations were for the appearance of fi lth in a food product and
for failure to fi le information or register a specifi ed process. When specifi c
pathogens were identifi ed in import refusals, they tended to be found in food
products typically associated with such risks (e.g., Listeria in cheese and
cheese products).
How Was the Study Conducted?
Researchers analyzed FDA Import Refusal Reports (IRR) for food shipments
refused entry into U.S. commerce between 1998 and 2004. Tabulations were
created of refusals by industry group and FDA violation code (e.g., type of
violation). Adulteration violations were examined closely, particularly those
linked to pathogen contamination.
