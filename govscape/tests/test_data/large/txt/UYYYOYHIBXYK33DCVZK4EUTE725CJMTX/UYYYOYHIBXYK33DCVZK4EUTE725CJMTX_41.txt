If the examination and analysis indicate the product is in compliance, the
shipment may be released into U.S. commerce. If there is a violation, the
product will be refused admission. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
Section 801, directs FDA to refuse admission of any article that “appears” to
be in violation of the Act.
When the FDA requests a sample of an article offered for import, the owner
or consignee shall hold the shipment and not distribute it until further notice
is received regarding the results of the examination. If it appears an article is
in violation, the FDA issues a Notice of Detention and Hearing to the owner
or consignee specifying a place and period of time whereby the individual
may introduce testimony either verbally or in writing.
The importer is provided an opportunity to submit a petition to recondition
the product into compliance. The owner or consignee may submit an appli-
cation to the FDA to relabel or perform other actions to bring the article into
compliance or render the article other than a food. An application to relabel
or perform other actions to bring the article into compliance must contain a
detailed proposal, specifying the time and place where such operations will
be carried out and the approximate completion time according to regula-
tion. All petitions to recondition a product are subject to FDA review and
approval.
If the product is refused, the importer is required to either re-export or
destroy the article under CBP or other approved supervision. If the refused
product is not destroyed or re-exported, CBP issues a notice for redelivery to
the importer of record. Failure to redeliver the refused product may result in
CBP’s assessing liquidation damages against the importer’s bond.
Import Alerts
Import alerts were developed by the FDA to communicate guidance for
import coverage to FDA personnel in fi eld offi ces, as well as to identify
and disseminate import information on problems and violative trends.
Import alerts facilitate uniform and effective import coverage. They iden-
tify problem commodities and/or shippers, such as those that have met the
criteria for DWPE. We performed a rough tabulation of the import alerts
posted on the FDA Web site on July 23, 2007. On that date, a total of 127
alerts involving food imports were posted (see http://www.fda.gov/ora/fi ars/
ora_import_foods.html). Our count excluded food additives, multiple food
warehouses, and miscellaneous food items, yet included import alerts for
foods in the generic FDA import alert category (No. 99), a catch-all category
for items, such as animal drugs, feed and food, medical devices, and items
not found in other industry codes. FDA classifi cation and terminology has
changed over time, so this count may not perfectly align with terminology
used at other points in time. For example, the FDA no longer uses the term
“automatic detention,” yet the term still appears in several import alerts
which we count under the “other” category. Despite the rough nature of
this table, it is important to note that 103 out of 127 import alerts called for
DWPE (over 81 percent).
