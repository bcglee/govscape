found in many foods. Table 5 illustrates the 4,445 Salmonella violations;
3,007 were for fi shery and seafood products (67.6 percent), 739 were
for spices, fl avors, and salts (16.6 percent), 139 were for vegetables and
vegetable products (3.1 percent), 131 were for fruits and fruit products (2.9
percent), and 100 were for nuts and edible seeds (2.2 percent).
Out of 1,746 violations for Listeria, 49.6 percent of the violations were for
cheese and cheese products, 21.6 percent for fi shery and seafood products,
15.5 percent for fruits and fruit products, and 12.9 percent for multi-food
dinners, gravies, and sauces group (table 6).
All 282 histamine violations were for fi shery and seafood products. Of these,
131 were for tuna and 112 were associated with mahi-mahi (i.e., dolphin
fi sh). Histamine is a naturally occurring toxin that can accumulate in certain
types of seafood and has been linked to scrombroid poisoning outbreaks in
the United States.

1Meats have very few refusals, presumably due to the pre-certifi cation of inspection systems in
exporting countries carried out by USDA/FSIS and mandated by the U.S. food safety legislation
specifi c to meat and poultry and because the data only cover FDA-regulated products (see box,
“Food Safety Oversight in the United States,” p. 3).
