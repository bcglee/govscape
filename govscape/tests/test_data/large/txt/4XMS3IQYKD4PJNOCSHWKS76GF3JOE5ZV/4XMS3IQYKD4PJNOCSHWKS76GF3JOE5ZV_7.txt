SEEDBED FERTILITY
Warm season native grasses can be productive on low fertility soils, but fertilization will increase
plant vigor. Soil test the field prior to planting or cultivating. The pH should be adjusted to
around 6.0 if needed. Incorporate lime in the fall to allow it time to adjust pH before planting in
the spring. Fertility should be up to medium levels for phosphorous (P), and potassium (K).
Incorporate P and K into the soil at planting time. Do not apply nitrogen (N) at or before
planting time. Nitrogen and phosphorous have been shown to increase productivity. However,
nitrogen promotes weed growth, as well. Unless weed competition is low, N should be excluded
the first year until a stand becomes established. The only exception for N application is planting
critical sites, such as log decks, log roads, skid trails and other impoverished soils.
In addition to the above guidelines, follow the fertilizer and lime recommendation in your state.
Consult your Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) for more specific information based on site
and soils.
SEEDBED PREPARATION
Native warm season grasses are best established by creating a tilled, firm seedbed. It is best to
remove all vegetative cover through the use of approved herbicides or extensive tillage.
Seedbeds should be adequately plowed, disked and packed prior to planting. A cultipacker
works well for firming the seedbed. If a prepared hard seedbed is rained on before planting,
harrow and cultipack again before planting.
EQUIPMENT USED FOR SEEDING
Ideally seed will be drilled into a prepared seedbed. Switchgrass may be planted with a
conventional drill because it has a hard, smooth seed coat. Conventional drills equipped to seed
alfalfa work well. Eastern gamagrass seed is about the size of corn seed and is best planted with
a corn planter. Big and little bluestem and indiangrass seed have appendages with fine hair and
will not pass through conventional equipment unless they can be ordered as "debearded" or
brushed seed. Debearded seed may pass through a conventional drill, though it may still be best
to use a special drill designed for fluffy seed. Seed drills advertised as "native grass drills", such
as a Tye or Truax drill, have special boxes equipped with picker wheels and augers which help
prevent seed from sticking together and move the seed to the drilling mechanism. Many native
seed drills have multiple boxes, which allow for the sowing of both switchgrass and fluffy
seeded species at the same time. Switchgrass, indiangrass, and big and little bluestem should be
seeded at 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. In sandy soils be especially careful not to bury seed too deep!
Eastern gamagrass is usually seeded at 1/2 to 3/4 inches deep. Planting native grasses with
conservation tillage equipment is not recommended at this time.
If a seed drill is not available, seed may be broadcast over a site. Broadcast fluffy seed (bluestem
and indiangrass) with a drop spreader or cyclone spreader and then drag to lightly cover seed. If
you are using a cyclone spreader, try mixing seed with inert matter such as kitty litter or sawdust
for better spreading. Successful broadcast seeding can be achieved by increasing seeding rate and
by rolling or cultipacking before and after seeding. When planting a small area (1/4-acre) in
droughty conditions, an optional step to enhance the stand would involve lightly mulching the
seeded area.
