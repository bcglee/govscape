Recommended Varieties of Eastern gamagrass for use in Georgia
Eastern gamagrass
'Pete' Adapted to most of the southeast. It can be used for forage, silage,
hay, nutrient reclamation from lagoons and municipal spray fields
because of good nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. Used for urban
conservation during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics for beautification and
erosion control. Can be used for conservation buffers.
'Iuka' 'Iuka' is a new variety and its full range of adaptation is unknown at
this time. The plant materials centers have established plantings to
determine the performance and adaptation in the southeast. Pete is the
preferred variety at this time.
