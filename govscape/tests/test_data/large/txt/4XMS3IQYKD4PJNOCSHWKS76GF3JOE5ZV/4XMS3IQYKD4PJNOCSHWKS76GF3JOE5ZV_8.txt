SEEDING RATES
Warm season grasses species vary in their growth characteristics. This makes it more difficult to
manage mixtures for pasture or hay use, so only one species should be seeded per field. In areas
planted for wildlife and erosion control the management of mixtures is not as critical.
Information is being developed on the use and adaptability on establishing native grasses in
mixtures.
Seeding rates for pasture and hay, wildlife, critical area treatment and conservation buffers are
found in the tables 1 and 2.
Table 1: Seeding rate for species planted alone
Pounds of Pure Live Seed (PLS) per Acre
Species Seeds/lb. Forage Wildlife Buffers Critical Area
Big bluestem 165,000 7-10 3 7 8
Little bluestem 255,000 7-10 3 7 8
Switchgrass 389,000 6-10 2 8 8
Indiangrass 175,000 7-10 3 8 8
Eastern gamagrass 7,800 8-14 7 10 10
Table 2: Seeding rate for mixed species plantings
Pounds of Pure Live Seed (PLS) per Acre
Species Seeds/lb. Forage Wildlife Buffers Critical Area
Big bluestem 165,000 4 3 4 7
Little bluestem 255,000 3 2 3 7
Switchgrass* 389,000 4 2 3 5
Indiangrass 175,000 4 2 3 7
Eastern gamagrass* 7,800 ** ** 4 **

* Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass should not be pre-mixed with fluffy-seeded species
** Eastern gamagrass is best when used alone for these applications
SEED QUALITY
Warm season grasses can be quite variable in germination rate and the purity of seed. Pure Live
Seed (PLS) should always be used when purchasing seed and to determine the bulk amount of
seed necessary for a planting. It may be necessary to increase your seeding rate to provide the
recommended rates of pure live seed.
