PURCHASING SEED
It is best to purchase certified seed of varieties adapted to
the region of planting. Certified seed is guaranteed to be
true to a variety, and use of certified seed may lead to a
more reliable planting. It is best to order different species
and varieties separately instead of pre-mixed because
seeding and management specification will differ between
species.
Warm season grass species should be purchased on a
pure live seed (PLS) basis. Do not confuse 12 lb

may yield unexpected results.
TIME OF SEEDING
Warm season grasses are best established during March
through May. Early planting is critical even though warm
season grasses do not germinate until soil temperatures are
above 50 to 55 degrees F. Avoid planting after June 1
because moisture and weed competition may delay stand
establishment.
Early establishment allows seedlings to develop good
root systems before summer drought and greatly

weeds. Irrigation (if available) should be applied when
soil conditions are very dry to enhance seed
germination and stand establishment.
Seeding into warm soil in late spring can be helpful in
controlling weeds. The first flush of weeds is allowed to
germinate and then is killed by final tillage or contact
herbicide just prior to planting. Ideally, this practice would
result in the shortest period of bare ground and would get
grass seedlings up as quickly as possible to compete with
other weeds.
Eastern gamagrass InterCenter Strain Trial
(clipping in progress) to determine dry matter
production from 13 accessions and one standard
called 'Pete'. The dry matter yield for all
accession averaged 13,726 lbs./Ac. One accession
produced 17,000 lbs./Ac. of dry matter yield.
