(Tripsacum dactyloides)
Special Edition: For Farm Bill Implementation
Description: Eastern gamagrass is a robust native warm-
season, rhizomatous perennial grass that grows from 5 to 9
feet in height. Leaf blades are 12 to 24 inches long and 3/8
to ¾ inch wide, flat and have a pronounced midrib.
Recommended varieties are ‘Pete’ and ‘Iuka’. They are
lowland adapted and respond well to fertilization.
Cattle like them so well, grazing should be closely monitored
to keep stand from being grazed too hard.
