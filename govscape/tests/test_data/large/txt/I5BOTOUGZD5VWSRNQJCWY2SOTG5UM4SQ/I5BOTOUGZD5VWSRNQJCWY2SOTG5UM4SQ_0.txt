EIAV is usually transmitted from horse to horse by of tests
large biting insects such as horseflies and deerflies. The 2,500,000
bites from these flies stimulate defensive movement by
the horse, which often results in an interruption of the 2,000,000
flies’ blood feeding. When interrupted, flies are motivated
to complete feeding as soon as possible. They then
