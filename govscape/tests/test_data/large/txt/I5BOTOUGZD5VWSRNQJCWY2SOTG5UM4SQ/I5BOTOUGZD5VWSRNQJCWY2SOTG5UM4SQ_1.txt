Council’s Health and Regulatory Committee along with
State Veterinary Regulatory officials from the 28 States
participating in the Equine ‘98 study (see map 2 next
page) agreed that testing the serum bank was a priority
for the industry and an appropriate use of the banked
sera.
The Equine ‘98 study estimated that overall 40.9
percent of equine operations tested at least one resident
horse for EIAV in 1997 and that just over 35 percent of
horses were tested annually. For operations that tested
for EIAV, the most common reason for testing was
