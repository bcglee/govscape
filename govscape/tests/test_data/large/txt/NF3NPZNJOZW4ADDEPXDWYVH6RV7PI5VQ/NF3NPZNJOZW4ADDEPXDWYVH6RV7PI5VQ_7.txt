2O Manya reas of the northern Great Plains contain saline seeps
that significantly reducec rop productiona ndi nconvenience
farming operations on adjacent areas. VanderP luym( 1978)
estimatedt hat about2 million acresa re affected in the northern
Great Plains Regiono f Alberta, SaskatchewanM, anitoba,M on-
tana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Vasey( 1976) reported
that soil surveysm adein the thirties in NorthD akotas howetdh e
presenceo f saline seepsi n a few counties. Warden(1 954)
reported that saline seepsw ereb ecominge vident in north-
central Montanaa s eady as 1941. Saline seepso ccur on all
classes of land. A 1981s oil survey report of AdamCs ounty,
N. Dak., showedthdei stribution of saline seepsb yland classes
as follows: 27 percentw ereo nc lass II land; 65 percento n class
III land; 5 percenot n class IV land; and3 percenot n class V, VI,
VII, andV III land (USDA1 981).
