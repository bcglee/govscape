Changesin land use from native rangelandt o dryland grain
production, improvedf arming technology, and pedodso f high
precipitation havec ontributed to a dryland salinity problem
termed" saline seep" in the northern Great Plains. The geology
of the area, waterm ovingth rought he soil profile as a result of
farming systems,a nd climate are responsible for the develop-
mento f saline seeps.
Thep urposeo f this publication is to provide( 1) a general
description of extent and history of the saline-seepp roblem,
(2) methodsfo r identifying saline-seepr echargea reas,
(3) methodfso r controlling saline seeps, (4) information
reclamationo f saline-seepa reas that haveb eenc ontrolled, and
(5) information on the environmentala nde conomicfa ctors
affecting saline seeps. This publication summarize1s0 yearso f
research and experience on the saline-seep problema nd
servesa s a guide for public service agencies,f arm consultants,
and farmers whoa re concernedw ith the saline-seep problem.
