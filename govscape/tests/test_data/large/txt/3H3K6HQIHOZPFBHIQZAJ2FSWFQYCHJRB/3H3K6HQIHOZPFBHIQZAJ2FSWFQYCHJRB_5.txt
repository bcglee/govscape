Figure 3: Collecting Fremont cottonwood seed capsules in the field proved to be relatively easy (A), but willows had to be carefully
identified beforehand (B). The cottonwood and Goodding’s willow seeds germinated well and produced shippable seedlings in only
4 mo (C).
THE CHALLENGE OF
QUAKING ASPEN
Conventional Techniques
In the willow family, aspen is unique in that
stem cuttings root poorly, so, nurseries have had
better luck forcing sprouts from root sections
and getting them to root (Dreesen and others
2002). We collected root sections from quaking
aspen at 2 locations on the Hopi Reservation but
they did not produce sprouts. This may be due to
the timing of the collections or the lack of vigor
in the parent trees.
Therefore, we were excited when we noticed
aspen catkins on some of the trees in Aspen
Canyon (Figure 4A). When they were taken to
Los Lunas PMC and cleaned, however, the
catkins yielded no viable seeds. This may have
been due to poor pollination or moisture stress
from the extended drought in the region. On a
subsequent trip, some viable seeds were
collected from healthier aspen stands on the
surrounding Navajo Reservation. This time, the
catkins did yield some viable seeds and around a
dozen seedlings were grown in 262 cm3 (16 in3)

further growth. Using the few seedlings that came from that collection, we
tried a new “stacked progpagation” technique to “bulk-up”
the number of plants (B–D).
