Fremont cottonwood (Figure 3A) at Pasture
Canyon which, because of the great distance
from Kearns Canyon and other collection areas
(Figure 1A), should give us a good mix of
genetics. We also collected seeds of Goodding’s
willow at Blue Canyon; however, because exotic
willows such as Salix babylonica (auct. non L.)
had invaded at some sites, all willows had to

Direct seed propagation turned out to be easier
than we had imagined. The seed capsules were
cleaned using the procedure of the Los Lunas
PMC (Dreesen 2003) and seeds were sown
immediately in Ray Leach Cone-tainers™ (164
cm3 [10 in3]). Even though the Fremont
cottonwood and Goodding's willow seeds were
collected in mid-June, we were still able to
produce large seedlings by the end of
September-a growing season of only 4 months
(Figure 3C). In fact, we decided to top prune
these seedlings to maintain a favorable root-to-
shoot balance.
