Removal of the salt-cedar and Russian-olive has
been completed on some sites, for instance,
Polacca Wash (Figure 1D). This area has also
been fenced to keep cattle out and so is ready for
outplanting, but the salt-cedar is already
resprouting. Some test outplantings have proven
successful so our challenge now is to produce
enough plant materials of the proper stocktype
and have them ready when the sites have been
prepared.
THE PROPAGATION STRATEGY
Once the native plants had been identified, the
next step was to determine where to propagate
them. Because the Hopi do not have their own
nursery, we contacted the Los Lunas Plant
Materials Center (PMC) in New Mexico, which
is operated by the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) (Figure 1A).
They have extensive experience growing native
plants in greenhouses and outdoor fields for
riparian restoration projects (Dreesen and others
