The NGPRL Soil Sample Archive
Sustaining highly productive and environmentally sound agricultural management systems will
be a major challenge over the next several decades given projections for human population
growth and global climate change. Because of these conditions, long-term agricultural
experiments will play an important role in understanding how management systems affect soil
attributes – and, in turn – how changes in soil attributes impact the broader environment.
Documenting management effects on soil attributes requires not only well-managed long-term
experiments, but also carefully cataloged soil archives. Archived soil samples provide ‘time
capsules’ for determining changes in soil attributes over time, and are particularly valuable as
new analytical capabilities are developed.
In the 1940s, a soil archive was initiated at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory
NGPRL Soil Archive
(NGPRL) to provide the opportunity for evaluate the effects of long-term grazing and cropping
management practices on soil attributes over time. The NGPRL soil archive includes over
5000 samples ranging in age from 4 to 90 years. Most of the samples in the archive come
from evaluations of the historical pasture treatments at NGPRL or from a multi-state crop-
ping system evaluation conducted by Howard Haas in the early 1950s. The Haas samples
included cropping treatments under various crop sequences and fertility regimes (e.g.,
manure, no manure), as well as native vegetation. These samples were used to by Haas to
document the extent of soil carbon loss caused by converting native vegetation to dryland
cropping throughout the U.S. Great Plains.
The sample archive is housed in a building south of the NGPRL main campus. The building
was built in the 1940s to support regional soil studies by the USDA Soil Conservation
Service (now NRCS).
There are numerous opportunities for research using the NGPRL soil archive, opportunities
SCS Building at NGPRL that include detailed characterizations of soil organic matter fractions, analyses of
micronutrient content, and evaluations of soil acidity (just to mention a few examples).
Overall, collaborative research projects using the NGPRL soil archive should provide a more in-depth understanding of long-term cropping
and grazing effects on soil. This is particularly valuable for the region associated with the archive’s domain (semiarid Great Plains), as
changes in soil properties resulting from management often take decades to be expressed.
