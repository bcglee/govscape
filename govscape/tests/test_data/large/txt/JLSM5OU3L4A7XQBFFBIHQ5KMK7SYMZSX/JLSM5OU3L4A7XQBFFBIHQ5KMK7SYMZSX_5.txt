Retired Scientists Continue Their Passion for Science
The Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory is blessed by committed scientists who elect to continue their research after their official
retirement begins. These scientists have continued in official status as “Collaborators” with the Agricultural Research Service. They maintain
offices and administrative support at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory in Mandan and remain active, contributing scientists
long into retirement.
