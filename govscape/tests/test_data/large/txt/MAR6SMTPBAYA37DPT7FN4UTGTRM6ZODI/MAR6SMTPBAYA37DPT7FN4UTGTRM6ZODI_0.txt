Abstract: In Louisiana and Texas DRC-1339-treated brown rice is used to manage blackbird populations that cause severe
damage to newly planted rice. Nontarget bird species have been observed on some DRC-1339 bait sites. We conducted dietary
toxicity tests to provide additional data on the toxicity of DRC-1339 to the following nontarget species observed on DRC-1339
bait sites: savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), snow geese (Chen caerule-
scens), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), and American tree sparrows (Spizella
arborea). During our 5-day DRC-1339 dietary test, in which birds were fed only 2% DRC-1339-treated brown rice diluted 1:25
with untreated brown rice, no mortality occurred to Canada geese or snow geese, and 1 mortality occurred to savannah spar-
rows. Nine of 10 mourning doves, 8 of 9 meadowlarks and 8 of 10 American tree sparrows died during the same test. Most test
species exhibited some degree of aversion to the DRC-1339 bait, indicating that in free-feeding situations such as DRC-1339 bait
sites most nontarget birds might ingest sublethal doses and subsequently avoid treated baits. Rapid degradation and discoloration
of DRC-1339 baits reduce the risk for nontarget species at DRC-1339 bait sites.
