Introduction: Storage of vegetable and flower bedding plants may be necessary in situations where
adverse weather conditions, seasonal availability, or extension of the time of availability makes it essential.
There are two stages of plants in bedding plant production and storage: plugs and finished plants. Generally,
finished bedding plants are hardier and can withstand greater environmental changes than the plug stage of
the same plant. However, storage is easier when the plant is in the more compact plug stage.
Plug Storage: Most bedding plants are produced as plugs. Research on plug storage is mainly limited to
that published in recent years. Heins et al. (1995) found that the duration a species could be stored without
plant death or flowering delay was influenced by storage temperature and irradiance. Plant quality
improved with the addition of light compared to that of plants in dark storage, especially as the duration of
storage and storage temperature increased (Heins and Lang, 1992a, 1992c, 1992d; Heins and Wallace,
1993a, 1993b). Shipping plugs in boxes or trucks is in fact a form of short-term storage. As the duration
of shipping increases, cooling plugs prior to shipping becomes more important, and will improve their
postharvest condition when they reach their final destination (Heins et al. 1994b; Kaczperski et al., 1996;
Lang et al., 1991a). The impact of storage on plugs may vary depending on the specific storage conditions,
age, species, cultivar, and physiological state of the plugs. The optimum storage temperatures and
maximum storage durations for selected species are shown in Table 1.
Growers who only have one or two coolers may need to store plugs of several species at one time.
Researchers in Michigan (Heins and Lange, 1992d,; Heins et al., 1992) showed how to identify a
compromise temperature, one that is collectively acceptable, although maybe not individually optimal. If
only short-term storage is necessary, a temperature warmer than the optimum may be more economical
(Heins et al., 1994b). Also, the environmental conditions before and after storage can influence the growth
of the plugs following storage (Heins et al., 1991, 1994b; Heins and Lange, 1992a; Kaczperski et al., 1996).
A major disease problem associated with plug storage is Botrytis (Heins et al., 1992, 1994b, 1995;
Lang et al., 1991a, 1991b). Maintaining a high RH in a cooler decreases the frequency of watering, but also
favors the growth of Botrytis. The disease is generally not a problem on pansies, but does affect many
species including impatiens, geraniums, and petunias. Those crops should be stored under low RH
conditions and irrigated if plugs are stored longer than 1 week (Heins et al., 1991).
Growers should be aware that low RH in coolers with significant air velocity causes plugs to dry out
quickly. The frequency of irrigations will vary, depending on the temperature and RH of the cooler.
Contact between the foliage and water should be minimized to avoid fungal infection. Plugs can be
sub-irrigated with clear water as needed during storage because the plantsâ€™ nutritional needs are minimal
under low temperatures (Heins and Lange, 1992a; Heins et al., 1994b). Heins et al. (1994a) recommend
applications of certain fungicide tank mixtures for controlling Botrytis blight and sporulation during plug
storage.
Plugs grown with high fertility, resulting in lush, soft growth preceding storage, are more susceptible
to Botrytis during storage (Heins et al., 1994b; Kaczperski et al., 1996). These plants are more likely to
weaken under the stress of storage than hardened plants, allowing invasion by the pathogen. Plugs in a
toned or hardened condition because of reductions in fertility prior to storage are more resistant to Botrytis
(Heins et al., 1995). In addition, hardening of these plugs will aid in the plugs resistance to drought stress.
A hardened plug will resist drought damage better than a plug grown with high levels of phosphorus
(Borch et al., 1999).
Plug storage has the potential to become a viable grower management tool (Heins and Lange, 1992b)
if cooler space is available. However, as with any new technique, growers should experiment with just a
few plug trays before they commit a large volume to storage (Heins et al., 1991; Heins and Lange, 1992a;
