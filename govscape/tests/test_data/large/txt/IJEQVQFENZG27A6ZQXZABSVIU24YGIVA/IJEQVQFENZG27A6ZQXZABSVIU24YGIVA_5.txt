Finished Plant Storage: Finished bedding plants are those that are in a state ready for sale to the general
public. Generally, finished plants are not stored in coolers because of the difficulty of moving large
quantities of plants from greenhouse to cooler. To reduce plant growth, greenhouse temperatures are
dropped while waiting for the crop to sell. Finished plants should be held at temperatures low enough to
reduce growth, but not to cause damage or impair future growth. The following table lists certain cultivars
of popular bedding and vegetable plants, and suggested holding temperatures.
According to Nelson (1983), a general greenhouse holding temperature of 13 °C (55 °F) is applicable
for many of the common types of bedding and vegetable plants. Alyssum, begonia, geranium, impatiens,
marigold, petunia, salvia, pepper, and tomato all kept well at this temperature. Impatiens plants were still
marketable after 36 days at this temperature. Bedding plants hold better at a higher light level (7500 lux)
than at a lower light level (500 to 2700 lux).
Conifer and Hardwood Seedling Storage: Storage of conifer and hardwood forest seedlings is possible
at a low temperature and high RH (Aldhous, 1964; Camm et al., 1994; Duffield and Eide, 1959). Loosely
tied bundles of seedlings, as well as containerized seedlings may be stored in conditions that lower the
metabolic activity of the plants. However, for most species, temperatures should be kept above freezing to
avoid injury (Camm et al., 1994; Lantz et al., 1989). Top and root growth capacity are affected by the cold
storage of certain seedlings, and these are dependent on seed source and lifting date of the seedlings
(Jenkinson et al., 1993). A cold hardened seedling will store more successfully and for a longer period of
time than a non-hardened seedling. Maximum stress resistance occurs in late Fall to early Winter.
Therefore, lifting dates for seedlings being put into cold storage should be delayed as long as possible
(Camm et al., 1994).
Warehouses or sheds can be used for storage of seedlings at a variety of temperatures. Refrigerated
storage rooms or coolers are also used for storing seedlings at cooler temperatures (1 to 4 °C; 34 to 40 °F).
High RH and good air circulation, as well as daily photoperiod control where possible, are important
factors that influence the success of seedling storage (Camm et al., 1994; Lantz et al., 1989).
Storage of seedlings may be done in polyethylene bags to facilitate high RH, but spacing between the
bags must be enough to allow for adequate air movement in order to avoid fungal pathogens. Loosely tied
bundles of seedlings may be packed with slightly wet peat surrounding the roots and then wrapped in
film-coated paper with the tops exposed and placed in a container for storage. With prolonged storage, root
growth capacity can decline (> 6 mo), as well as lead to a disruption of naturally occurring seasonal
progression events. The following chart lists several species which may be stored for up to 3 mo at 1 to 4
°C (34 to 40 °F).
