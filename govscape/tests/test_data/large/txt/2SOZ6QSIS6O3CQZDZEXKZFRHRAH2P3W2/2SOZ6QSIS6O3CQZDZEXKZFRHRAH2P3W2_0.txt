Ethnobotanic Uses
Camas was and continues to be one of the most important “root” foods of western North
American indigenous peoples, from southwestern British Columbia to Montana, and south to
California (Kuhnlein and Turner 1991). The part of the plant that was relished is actually a bulb.
Camas was used by Northwest Coast peoples, the Coast Salish of Vancouver Island, western
Washington groups, the Squamish, the Sechelt, the Comox, and the Kwak-waka'wakw of the
British Columbia coast. Camas was considered to be one of the most important bulbs to local
California natives; great camas was particularly valued by the Maidu.
Except for choice varieties of dried salmon, no other food item was more widely traded (Gunther
1973). People traveled great distances to harvest the bulbs. There is some suggestion that plants
were dispersed beyond their range by transplanting (Turner and Efrat 1982; Turner et al. 1983).
To the Nez Perce people, camas still is the most important root in trade, and trading is impossible
without camas bulbs (Harbinger 1964). Dried camas is the most expensive form of camas, with
baked and then raw camas being less expensive. At marriage trades, the girl’s family gives roots
in corn husk bags. At funeral trades, camas roots are given to friends and relatives by the widow.
The Nez Perce traded camas roots with the Warm Springs, the Umatilla, the Cayuse, the Walla
Walla, the Nespelem, the Yakama, the Crow, and the Flathead.
