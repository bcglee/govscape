Adaptation
Great camas grows in wet meadows, woods, prairies, moist hillsides, and streamside areas.
Camas habitat is often ephemeral, and dries up by late spring. Great camas grows from south
Vancouver Island to northern California, from the coast to the Cascade and Sierra Nevada
Mountains at elevations below 10,800 feet (3300 meters). This sub-species does not extend east
of the Cascades. In British Columbia, great camas is restricted to wet flats, ditches, and moist
rocky areas on southern Vancouver Island and the adjacent Gulf Islands. Great camas blooms in
late April to late June. Common and great camas often grow together.
Plant Establishment
Great camas can be propagated from seeds or bulbs; shade tolerance, moisture requirement, and
preferred planting depth may differ among specific phenotypes. Great camas is frequently found
in areas with soil moisture persisting throughout most of the growing season. It’s preferred
habitat includes shady environments such as those that occur along riparian zones or under
moderately dense deciduous forest canopies in western Oregon. However, it can be found in
more open habitats elsewhere within its natural range; the two camas sub-species are generally
found in the same environments. The bulbs of great camas can be substantially larger in size and
deeper in the soil than common camas, and sometimes grow 16 inches or more below the
surface. Bulb depth appears limited by shallow water tables, anoxic conditions, or restrictive
layers. The occasional occurrence of a large, thick root beneath a bulb may aid in re-locating or
re-establishing it at a greater depth. Plants require irrigation or moist soil conditions to become
established. Great camas can be difficult to establish in California.
Live Plant (Bulb) Collections
Great camas is readily established by transplanting wild or commercially grown bulbs. Wild
harvests should be restricted to salvage sites with appropriate approvals or permits. Due to loss of
wetland habitat throughout the United States, harvesting plants from the wild is rarely
appropriate or legal except under salvage situations. Use of bulbs or seeds from local nurseries or
greenhouses is strongly recommended.
Camas reproduces vegetatively by offset bulblets, but the degree varies widely by species and
local growing conditions (De Hertogh et. al. 1993, Thoms 1989). The best time to excavate wild
bulbs is from early summer through mid-fall. This is the “quiescent” period that follows seed
maturation, foliar senescence, and development of the daughter bulb. However, commercial bulb
harvest takes place when the leaves are still green and must be done carefully to avoid damage.
The bulb “tunic” or covering is very thin (De Hertogh and Le Nard 1993). Given that camas
commonly occupies sites high in silt and clay that dry out in summer, windows for digging are
often narrow. Store the bulbs in a cool, dry, dark, and well-ventilated place in a potting medium
such as dry peat moss, similar to recommendations for fall planted/spring flowering bulbs (such
