The bulbs were usually dug after flowering, in summer, although some peoples dug them in
spring. Harvesting the bulbs traditionally took weeks or months among the Nez Perce. Each
family group “owned” its own camping spot and harvesting spot. These were passed down in
families from generation to generation. Turf was lifted out systematically in small sections and
then replaced after only larger bulbs had been removed. The bulbs were dug with a pointed
digging stick; bulbs were broken up and replanted. Annual controlled burning was used to
maintain an open prairie-like habitat for optimum camas production. Areas were harvested only
every few years.
Traditionally, camas bulbs were almost always pit-cooked; within the past 100 years, camas
bulbs have also been cooked by stovetop methods (Turner and Kuhnlein 1983). The bulbs are
allowed to cook for 24-36 hours when pit-cooked (Turner and Bell 1971). It is probable that
lengthy cooking is necessary for maximum conversion of the inulin in Camassia to fructose. The
sweetness of cooked camas gave it utility as a sweetener and enhancer of other foods. Before
sugar, molasses, and honey were introduced by European traders, sweetening agents were in
short supply among native peoples, and camas was highly valued in this capacity. Sometimes
other foods, such as the rhizomes of springbank clover (Trifolium wormskioldii) and the roots of
Pacific silverweed (Potentilla anserina ssp. pacifica) were cooked with the camas bulbs. The
Kalapuyan of the Willamette Valley in Oregon used to flavor camas with tarweed (Madia
elegans). Bulbs don’t keep well fresh. They were cooked or sun-dried and stored for later use.
Sometimes camas bulbs were pressed flat and made into camas cakes the size of biscuits before
being dried (Turner et al. 1983). Dried bulbs were re-constituted by soaking in water, usually
overnight.
Many of the traditional camas gathering sites, such as Weippe Prairie and Camas Prairie in Idaho
and the Willamette Valley in Oregon, have been converted to agriculture. The average size of a
camas patch needed to feed a five person family was 2.7 ha (Thoms 1989). Camas roots are hard
to find now. Restoration of camas prairies and access to camas bulbs are priorities of many
Indian people. At one time, “When camas was in bloom in wet meadows, the flowers grow so
thickly that they look like a blue lake” (Murphey 1959:14).
Camas stalks and leaves were used for making mattresses. It was sometimes used in place of
grass when baking camas in pits. Camas is used by the Nez Perce as a cough medicine. It is
boiled, and the juice is strained and mixed with honey. Horticulturally, this plant is used for cut
flowers, beds, borders, ground cover, rock gardens, and prairie restoration.
Other Uses
Elk, deer, and moose reportedly graze camas early in the spring (Craighead, Craighead, and
Davis 1963). Gophers eat camas and move the bulbs to another area where they sprout and grow
the next year (Watson 1988). Indian women in Oregon’s Umpqua Valley robbed camas bulbs
from gopher caches (Piper 1916). Herbivorous insects also eat camas leaves.
