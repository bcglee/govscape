as daffodils and tulips). Keep the bulbs from completely drying out and transport or store at 63-
68º (De Hertogh, Noone and Lutman 1990).
Plant camas bulbs outdoors in the fall or early winter when soils are moist enough to dig and
prevailing soil temperatures are cool; this is generally below 60°F. Fall planting allows for better
root development and fulfillment of any chilling requirement for flowering (De Hertogh et. al.
1993). Bulbs, bulblets, and offsets can be utilized. However, if flowering is desired the
following spring, bulbs must be of sufficient age (3-5 years old with 3-4 bulb leaves or scales)
and size (Thoms 1989). Bulb leaves are laminate concentric layers that comprise much of the
bulb, reminiscent of an onion. For common camas, bulbs with just two bulb leaves never flower,
those with three routinely flower, and those with four almost always flower (Thoms 1989). A
similar relationship can be expected for great camas. Older bulbs will be found deeper in the
ground (Thoms 1989). In the commercial bulb trade the minimum size for export of great camas,
and thus flowering, is a circumference of 4.7-5.5 inches (12-14 cm) (De Hertogh and Le Nard
1993). This is roughly equivalent to a diameter of 1.5-1.75 inches (3.8-4.5 cm) and about twice
the circumference and diameter of common camas bulbs.
The larger the bulb the greater the planting depth can be. Planting depth ranges from 1-1.5 inches
for 1-2 year old bulblets up to 4-8 inches for mature bulbs (as measured to their base). Larger
bulbs of great camas (2 inches in diameter or greater) can be planted deeper (8-16 inches) if
drainage is appropriate. Commercial production involves planting from October to November in
well drained soil of pH 6-7 with at least 2% organic matter, covering with at least 3 inches of soil
above the bulb “nose”, applying 2 inches of straw mulch, fertilizing with 7-14-28 fertilizer four
weeks after planting, and harvesting in July (De Hertogh, Noone and Lutman 1990, Langaslag
1989). Keep the camas bed damp until it gets warm. Once plants senesce after flowering, stop
watering as the seeds form and bulbs cure. Suggested spacing recommendations for Camassia in
flower beds and naturalized landscapes vary from 3-4 inches apart (8-10 per sq. ft.) to 6-8 inches
apart. Other publications recommend 6-8 bulbs every 12 inches for outdoor gardens. Since bulbs
of great camas are larger than common camas, allowance for wider spacing is reasonable. It may
be necessary to bury bulbs with a protective wire mesh to prevent herbivory; the mesh needs to
be coarse enough to allow shoots to grow through (De Hertogh et. al. 1993).
Seed Collections
Great camas propagates easily from seed. Camas seeds can be collected as soon as the pods
mature (turn light brown) or split open to reveal the mature black seeds. This may be late May,
June or July depending on latitude, longitude, moisture conditions, shade, or elevation. Dry seeds
can be stored frozen or in a cool, dry place prior to planting.
Great camas seed will benefit from 42-100 days of cold temperatures (34-40°F) and moist
stratification for maximum germination (90-100%) (Emery 1988, Guerrant and Raven 1995,
Deno 1993, Northway pers. comm. 1998). “Moist stratification” means placement of seeds which
are “imbibed”, or have soaked up water, in layers of a moist medium at cool temperatures to
allow for after-ripening. Germination also requires cool conditions and can occur in the dark
(Northway pers. comm. 1998). The alternative is to plant seeds outdoors in the fall (Sept-Oct).
