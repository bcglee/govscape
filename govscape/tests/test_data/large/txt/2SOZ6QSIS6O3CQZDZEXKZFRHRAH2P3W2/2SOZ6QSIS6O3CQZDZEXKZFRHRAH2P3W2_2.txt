Description
Great camas or Leichtlin’s camas (Camassia quamash spp. quamash) is a liliaceous, perennial
herb that grows from an edible bulb. The plant can grow from 24-48 inches (60-120 cm) tall.
Leaves are long and narrow, grass-like, and emerge from the base. The inflorescence is a spike-
like cluster borne on a leafless stem that is held above the leaves. Camas flowers are creamy-
white to deep blue-violet; they have 6 tepals, 6 stamens, and 3 stigmas. The white form is
considered to be native only to the Umpqua Valley of Oregon. Great camas differs from common
camas (Camassia quamash ssp. breviflora) in the following ways: the flowers are regular, with
tepals that twist together after anthesis and remain over the ovary; anthers are dull yellow to
violet; the plant is larger, with longer flower stalks and bigger bulbs; and there is a fine, waxy
powder on the leaves. The seeds are usually larger as well. The fruits are barrel-shaped to three-
angled capsules, splitting into three parts to release many black, angled seeds.
Cultivars
Cultivars of Leichtlin’s camas are available in the flower bulb industry. One cultivar, C.
leichtlinii ‘Alba’, is white (or bluish-white), while ‘Caerulea’ has light blue flowers, and ‘Plena’
has double greenish yellow blooms (Brenzel 1995). ‘Blauwe Donau’ is described as having sea-
lavender-violet flowers and lilac anthers. ‘Lady Eve Price’ has campanula-violet flowers with
each segment having a darker colored methyl-violet central stripe. ‘Semiplena’ has large, semi-
double, creamy-white flowers. The botanical variety or subspecies suksdorfii has blue to violet
flowers (Royal General Bulbgrowers’ Association 1991).
