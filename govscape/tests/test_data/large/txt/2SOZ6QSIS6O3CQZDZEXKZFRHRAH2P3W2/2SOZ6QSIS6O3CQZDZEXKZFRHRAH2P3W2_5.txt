One-leafed, grass-like seedlings will emerge in February or March under suitable conditions
where winters are comparatively mild. In colder climates germination may occur later in the
spring. The germination temperature for great camas is probably similar to the 40 °F reported in
Wick et. al. (1998) for common camas. Seedlings require moisture through the spring growing
period to survive. Warm temperatures during seedling development can be lethal.
Suggested site preparation methods and seeding rates for wetland revegetation are not well
known, but in at least one study, a broadcast rate of 20 live seeds/sq. ft. for both Camassia sub-
species resulted in poor to good seedling counts the following spring (0-10 or more seedlings/sq.
ft.) (Darris pers. comm. 1999). Seedling success was dependent on weed competition, hydrology,
type of disturbance, mulch, erosion, or other factors. Seedling establishment appeared inhibited
by dense stands of live grass (Lolium multiflorum) but benefited from a grass (Deschampsia
cespitosa) mulch (straw) and less competition, at least on well-drained, stable, slightly higher
ground (Ibid). In areas with mild winters, soil scarification for shallow seed coverage or just
constant moisture from irrigation or winter rains can result in good germination. At least one
western Oregon grower sows seed directly on the soil surface in the fall (Robinson pers. comm.
1999). However, growers in Idaho have found that a 1-2 inch covering of organic mulch is
required during the first growing season to protect the tiny bulblet from exposure to dry soil,
surface cracking, and extreme temperatures. Sawdust or a chemically killed dense stand of grass
works well (Watson pers. comm. 1999). Seeds deeper than 0.4-0.8 inch (1-2 cm) will not
germinate successfully (Watson 1988).

Management
Camas is favored as forage by deer so fencing or repellents may be useful, particularly during the
first growing season. Consistent soil moisture is required every spring, but the soil can be
allowed to dry out soon after the pods mature or the leaves senesce (dry up and turn brown).
Moderate soil nutrient levels are beneficial. In natural settings, minor soil disturbance
(loosening, surface scarification) adjacent to existing specimens may enhance natural
regeneration by seed. Late summer field burning (where and when permitted) may improve
stand vigor, reduce competition from brush and certain weeds, and aid in regeneration. For
optimal bulb development, avoid mowing or grazing more than lightly, if at all, even during
foliar senescence. Individual plants may live 15-20 years.
Traditional Resource Management (TRM) was often intensive, to the point of being considered
“semi-agricultural” by some. According to Dr. Nancy Turner, TRM included the following:
• ownership, demarcation, and inheritance of beds or patches,
• clearing of rock, brush, and weedy vegetation,
• harvesting bulbs after seeds were produced, during specific times of the year,
• periodic field burning in summer after digging,
• in some cases sod removal then bulb removal followed by sod replacement,
• digging or “cultivation” to keep the soil loose,
• “selective breeding” by transplanting “better” bulbs to the beds,
• sustainable harvest techniques, including partial, selective harvests and incidental or planned
promotion of camas colonization and reproduction,
