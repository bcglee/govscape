longer than vacuum-cooling if the sweetcorn is packed. Bulk sweetcorn takes about 60 min to cool from
30 to 5 °C (86 to 41 °F) in a well-managed hydro-cooler, while crated sweetcorn takes about 80 min (Talbot
et al., 1991), and few if any operators leave it in that long. Periodic monitoring of sweetcorn temperature
is needed to ensure proper cooling to at least 10 °C (50 °F). Hydro-cooling nomographs for bulk and crated
sweetcorn are available (Stewart and Couey, 1963).
After hydro-cooling, top-icing is desirable during transport or holding to continue cooling, remove the
heat of respiration, and keep the husks fresh. When pre-cooling facilities are not available, sweetcorn can
be cooled with package ice and top-ice. Injection of an ice-water slurry (slush ice) into cartons was as
effective as hydro-cooling and better than vacuum-cooling in maintaining quality (Talbot et al., 1991),
probably due to residual ice in the cartons since the cooling rate was slower than for the other methods.
Optimum Storage Conditions: Traditional sweetcorn varieties are seldom stored for more than a few
days, because of the resulting serious deterioration and loss of tenderness and sweetness. The loss of sugar
is about 4-fold as rapid at 10 °C (50 °F) as at 0 °C (32 °F). At 30 °C (86 °F), 60% of the sugar in su1
sweetcorn can be converted to starch in a single day, while only 6% is converted at 0 °C (32 °F). While sh2
varieties lose sugar at the same rate as su1 varieties, their higher initial sugar levels keep it sweet-tasting
longer. For sh2 varieties, water loss and pericarp toughening supplant loss of sweetness in limiting
postharvest life (Brecht et al., 1990). The former is minimized by prompt cooling, trimming flag leaves and
long shanks, and maintaining high RH, usually by icing. Denting of kernels is promoted by water loss from
husk leaves (Showalter, 1967). A loss of 2% moisture may result in objectionable kernel denting. Pericarp
toughening can also be minimized by prompt cooling and by maintaining sweetcorn at 0 °C (32 °F). Under
optimum storage conditions, the potential postharvest life of sh2 sweetcorn is > 2 weeks.
Controlled Atmosphere (CA) Considerations: Increased attention for CA and MAP was spurred by an
interest in marine transport to export sweetcorn from the U.S. to Europe and the Far East, which can involve
transit times > 2 weeks. Injurious atmospheres at 1.7 °C (35 °F) contain < 2% O or > 15% CO (Spalding
2 2
et al., 1978), resulting in fermentation, off-flavors and odors. Reduced O and elevated CO reduce
2 2
respiration and slow sucrose loss; elevated CO also reduces decay and maintains green husk color (Aharoni
2
et al., 1996; Schouten, 1993; Spalding et al., 1978).
Retail Outlet Display Considerations: Display in refrigerated cases or with ice.
Chilling Sensitivity: Sweetcorn is not chilling sensitive; store as cold as possible without freezing.
Ethylene Production and Sensitivity: Sweetcorn produces only trace ethylene, and exogenous ethylene is
not a problem, although high ethylene amounts can lead to husk yellowing given sufficient exposure time.

To get mL kg-1 h-1, divide the mg kg-1 h-1 rate by 2.0 at 0 °C (32 °F), 1.9 at 10 °C (50 °F), and 1.8 at 20 °C
(68 °F). To calculate heat production, multiply mg kg-1 h-1 by 220 to get BTU per ton per day or by 61 to
get kcal per metric ton per day. Data are from Robinson (1975), Scholz et al. (1963), and Tewfik and Scott
(1954).
