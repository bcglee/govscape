Scientific Name and Introduction: Sweetcorn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa Bonaf.) is an annual grass of the
Poaceae (Grass) family. Traditional varieties are su1 (sugary1) mutants that contain about twice the sugar
(primarily sucrose) content of field corn, as well as 8- to 10-times higher water-soluble polysaccharide. The
latter imparts a creamy consistency to su1 sweetcorn. Other mutants with increased sugar content have
more recently been used, primarily sh2 (shrunken 2), which has at least double again the sugar content of
su1, but almost no water-soluble polysaccharide. Less commonly used is su1/se (sugary-enhancer); se
modifies su1 to also double the sugar content, but with no loss of water-soluble polysaccharide content
(Wann et al., 1997). The sh2 mutation inhibits starch biosynthesis while se does not. These newer varieties
are referred to as “supersweet” and have become the dominant type in all major U.S. sweetcorn production
regions. The high initial sugar content, coupled with inhibited starch synthesis in sh2 varieties, doubles the
potential postharvest life of sweetcorn. However, all supersweet varieties remain extremely perishable.
Quality Characteristics and Criteria: High quality sweetcorn has uniform size and color (yellow, white
or bicolor); sweet, plump, tender, well-developed kernels; fresh, tight, green husks; and is free from insect
injury, mechanical damage, and decay. Sweetness is the most important factor in consumer satisfaction
with sweetcorn (Evensen and Boyer, 1986). All sweetcorn varieties lose sweetness and aroma during
storage, but the taste of su1 and su1/se varieties becomes starchy while sh2 eventually taste watery and
bland.
Horticultural Maturity Indices: Sweetcorn harvest maturity is determined by a combination of ear fill,
silk drying, kernel development, kernel sweetness, and kernel tenderness. The appearance of the juice, or
endosperm, is a good indicator of maturity for su1 and se varieties, where a milky (not watery or doughy)
consistency represents proper maturity, but not for sh2 varieties, which always have a watery endosperm.
Grades, Sizes and Packaging: Grades include U.S. Fancy; U.S. Fancy, Husked; U.S. No. 1; U.S. No. 1,
Husked; and U.S. No. 2. Grades are based primarily on maturity, freshness, and cob length, as well as
freedom from various injuries and decay. Sweetcorn is commonly handled in wire-bound wooden crates,
and less commonly in waxed fiberboard cartons, or returnable plastic containers. All contain 54 to 60 ears
with a weight of about 19 kg (42 lb). Some is pre-packaged in polyvinylchloride (PVC) film-overwrapped
trays (Aharoni et al., 1996; Risse and McDonald, 1990), with the ends of ears trimmed and husks partially
removed to expose some kernels. PVC film is highly permeable to O and CO and acts as a moisture
2 2
barrier.
Pre-cooling Conditions: Sweetcorn is often > 30 °C (86 °F) when harvested, and rapid removal of field
heat is critical to retard deterioration. Maximum quality is retained by pre-cooling corn to 0 °C (32 °F)
within 1 h of harvest and holding it at 0 °C (32 °F) during marketing. In practice, cooling to this extent is
rarely achieved. However, cooling is the first step in a good temperature management program. Sweetcorn
has a high respiration rate, which results in a high rate of heat generation. Supersweet varieties have
respiration rates equal to that of traditional sweetcorn varieties and lose sugar as rapidly (Evensen and
Boyer, 1986; Olsen et al., 1991), so cooling is still critical with these newer varieties. Sweetcorn should not
be handled in bulk unless copiously iced, because it tends to heat throughout the pile.
Vacuum-cooling can adequately pre-cool sweetcorn, but it must be first wetted (and top-iced after
cooling) to minimize water loss from husks and kernels (Showalter, 1957; Stewart and Barger, 1960).
Crated sweetcorn can be vacuum-cooled from about 30 °C (86 °F) to 5 °C (41 °F) in 30 min. Hydro-cooling
by spraying, showering, or immersion in water at 0 to 3 °C (32 to 37.5 °F) is effective, although it takes
