Physiological Disorders: There are no significant disorders.
Postharvest Pathology: Decay is not usually a serious problem, but when present, it typically occurs on
the husk and silks. Trimming ears can promote decay development on the cut kernels and other damaged
tissues mainly caused by Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler, Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, and Mucor
hiemalis Wehmer (Aharoni et al., 1996). Thus, proper sanitation and temperature management are
important to minimize decay in trimmed sweetcorn.
Quarantine Issues: None.
Suitability as Fresh-cut Product: Fresh-cut sweetcorn kernels are extremely perishable. Their respiration
rate is very high; several times that of intact ears. Thus, temperature control is extremely critical if the
kernels are to have acceptable shelf-life. Problems during handling can include off flavors, microbial
survival/growth, and discoloration if the temperature is not maintained near 0 °C (32 °F). Especially
troublesome is browning when the kernels are cooked. This browning is greater in kernels from more
mature ears and is correlated with temperature, storage duration, and extent of physical damage.
Special Considerations: None.
