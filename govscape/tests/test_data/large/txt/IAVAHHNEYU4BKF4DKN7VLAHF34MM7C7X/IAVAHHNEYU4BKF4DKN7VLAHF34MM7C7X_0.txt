FOOD SERVICE ROLE
Food service operates as part of the educational team in schools; therefore, you do
more than just serve food to children. You help to support a healthy learning
environment for students. By making breakfast an option, you provide parents a choice
to feed their children at school. You are making a contribution to the success of
students in your school by making breakfast available.
WORKLOAD
Operating the School Breakfast Program does not necessarily mean more work for food
service personnel. When compared to lunch, breakfast can be simpler to prepare.
Depending on the breakfast service method you choose, it can be set up to work with
your current operation with very little change. It may even increase your revenue
enough to employ more people for longer hours, allowing you to offer benefits for your
employees. Also, prepackaged breakfast foods keep labor to a minimum.
MONEY
Your school can provide breakfast without financially burdening the school food service
program. USDA provides reimbursement for every breakfast served that meet
nutritional guidelines. Schools with high numbers of free and reduced priced
applications may find it is possible to offer free breakfast to every student.
