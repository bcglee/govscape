The newly sequenced genome for honey
bee, Apis mellifera, remains incomplete
and may contain some errors. One way
to verify the accuracy of the sequence
is by testing how many of the ‘predicted
genes’ are actually active, or transcribed.
In this project, the researchers created a
genome-wide map, obtained by a custom
designed microarray, to assist in validating
the sequence. This map confirmed a Cover reprinted with permission by Nature Publishing Group
surprising observation. Unlike the human
genome that contains large ‘gene deserts’
rich in nucleotides Adenine and Thymine, the honey bee genome is rich in the nucleotides Guanine and
Cytosine. Results using the new microarray express a 67 percent confidence that the predicted genes
were valid. Thus, these genes will be used for the “official gene set” for annotation and analysis by the
Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium. This work demonstrates an efficient approach for rapidly
developing an unbiased empirical annotation of a new genome. This process substantially reduced the
time-lag between sequencing and annotation. As a result, researchers can quickly identify the genes
that are relevant to key traits that may lead to improved honey bee pollination of the world’s crops.
