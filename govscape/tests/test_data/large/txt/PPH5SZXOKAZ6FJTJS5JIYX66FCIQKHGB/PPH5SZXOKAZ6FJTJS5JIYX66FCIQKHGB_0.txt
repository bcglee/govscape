APOSTLE ISLANDS NATIONAL LAKESHORE
IAA No. IA-6140-A-0007 (Rasp., Oak and Outer Islands)
FY2004 Summary
Prepared by
USDA- NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE
ROSE LAKE PLANT MATERIALS CENTER
East Lansing, MI
Introduction: This project was initiated in 2000 to produce native plant stock for
stabilizing slopes, preventing erosion, preserving native plant resources and revegetating
park lands. Under a Memorandum of Agreement species to be propagated were selected
from an amendable list. A minimum of 2 grass, 2 forb and 4 shrub species from this list
were supplied by the Center based on the material’s availability, viability and site
adaptability for the intended use. The Agreement further specified deliverables as 30
pounds of Canada wildrye seed, 500 forb/grass plugs and 500 shrub transplants.
Deliverables were distributed in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Additional plant distributions are
planned for 2005.
Accomplishments: Thirteen species were propagated in 2003 and 2004 for delivery to
the Park in 2004. A total of 5164 plants were delivered in May of 2004. Propagation
efforts continue at the PMC greenhouse for plant delivery in 2005.
The following is a list of species propagated and number of plants delivered to Apostle
Island National Lakeshore in 2004:
Red Elderberry – 100 Lowbush Blueberry - 650
Purpleflowering Raspberry – 100 Grayleaf Red Raspberry – 250
Beach Pea – 95 Wavy Hairgrass – 1460
Redosier Dogwood – 200 Sandcherry – 92
Pennsylvania Sedge – 1698 American Beachgrass – 350
Bush Honeysuckle – 7 Common Juniper – 62
Evening-Primrose – 100
Technology Development and Observations:
The Rose Lake Plant Materials Center tested several propagation techniques for several
gymnosperm species, including common juniper and yew. Establishing either species
from cuttings was, for the most part, not successful. Common juniper seeds were
stratified in a series of warm and cold treatments over a nine month timeframe.
Germination rate of common juniper using this method was greater than 50%.
