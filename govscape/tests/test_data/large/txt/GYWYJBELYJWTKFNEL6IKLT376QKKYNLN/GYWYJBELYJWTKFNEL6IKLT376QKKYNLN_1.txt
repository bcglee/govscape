Establishment: I
Prepare a clean weed free seedbed by disking and harrowing. Firm the
seedbed by cultipacking or use of grass drill. Seedbed should be firm
-
enough to allow the seed to be planted 1/4 1/2 inch deep. Use a no-
till grass drill with double disc openers, depth bands, packer wheels,
seed agitators and a positive feed mechanism capable of handling and
applying the seed in a uniform manner. Plants are largely self-
pollinated. Canada wildrye grows well on many kinds of soil and is
especially well adapted to sandy soils. Growth starts early and often
continues through the summer if moisture and temperature are
favorable. Growth may resume in the fall after a period of summer
dormancy. Grass maturity maybe reached in July.
The seedlings are very vigorous; therefore, new planting8 can be
established quickly. This makes Canada wildrye especially useful in
mixtures with other grasses, many of which do not produce ground cover
rapidly. The seed of wildrye is usually high in quality. It is
ordinarily ready for harvest from July in the South to August in the
Northern part of the region. Since the seed do not shatter readily,
harvesting may be extended over a period of several weeks.
Fertilizer: Apply no fertilizer the establishment year unless soil
test indicates a severe deficiency of nitrogen and/or phosphorus and
potassium. On established stands apply nitrogen at 40 to 60 pounds
per acre. Apply phosphorus and potassium according to soil test
recommendations.
Seedins Rates: Seeding rates for Canada wildrye should be about 15
pounds of pure live seed (PLS) per acre drilled. For seed production, ~
plant 30 to 40 PLS per linear foot of row when drilling in 30 inch
I
rows (6 to 8 PLS per acre). There are approximately 115,000 clean
debearded seeds in one pound of Canada wildrye. I
Seedins Dates: Spring (April to May), late summer (August to
September) or dormant seeding (November to March. The seed of Canada
wildrye needs cold stratification for maximum germination if eeeded in
spring or summer.
Manasement: Reduce weed competition by mowing at a height that will
not affect the grass seedlings. Protect from grazing; use 2,4-D for
broadleaf weeds. Remove dead plant material in spring for faster
green-up by shredding. Burning of straw will weaken the plants unless
done before it has broken dormancy.
