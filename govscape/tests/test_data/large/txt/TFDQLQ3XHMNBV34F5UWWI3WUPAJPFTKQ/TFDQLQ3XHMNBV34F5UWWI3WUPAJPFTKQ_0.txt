PASTURE AND HAY PLANTING
Warm Season Perennial Grass Planting
Virginia Conservation Practice Job Sheet 512 (b)
Practice Definition
Establishing stands of warm season grass(es) (WSG) or WSG mixed
with legumes and forbs as part of a resource management
conservation plan. The grasses may be used for forage, hay, pasture,
or wildlife habitat.
Purpose
This practice should be used to establish WSG stands and WSG
mixtures as part of a conservation plan for livestock, wildlife or both.
This practice may also be used to improve or maintain livestock
nutrition and/or health, extend the grazing season, reduce soil
erosion, improve water quality, balance forage supply and demand
during periods of low forage production, improve soil quality,
improve wildlife habitat, and increase carbon sequestration. Not all
warm season perennial grasses are suitable for wildlife habitat.
Conditions where Practice Applies
This practice applies on cropland, pastureland, hayland, and other lands where WSG is needed for pasture, forage, hay, or
wildlife habitat.
Species Selection
WSGs fall into two very different groups. The first is native WSG. This group of warm season forages includes
switchgrass, Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass, big and little bluestem. These are bunch grasses that are very well suited to
forage production, grazing, and wildlife. The second group is introduced species that are important forages but offer little
wildlife value. This group includes bermudagrass. This is a mat-forming grass spread by stolons and seed. With proper
management, bermudagrass may provide very good summer grazing in the Southern Piedmont and Coastal Plain portion
of the state. Caucasian bluestem, an introduced specie with growth habits similar to native WSGs, is not recommended
due to possible invasiveness, lower quality forage, and little wildlife value when compared to the native species. For
recommended planting dates and species, see Table 1.
Establishment Specifications
The use of native warm season grasses requires special attention to the details of establishment and management (seedbed
preparation, planting, and weed control). Full establishment may take as long as three years. The extra effort required
to establish WSG is offset by longevity of the stand, forage quality, and wildlife benefits provided.
WSG and WSG mixtures are to be established in the spring. Warm season grasses grow best when the weather is hot and
other species’ growth are declining. They begin growing when the soil temperature is above 50o F and continue to grow
until the soil temperature reaches nearly 90o F (usually May - September). If soil temperatures are cooler than 50o F or
moisture is not adequate, the seeds will remain dormant until conditions are favorable. WSG seed requires a cool, moist
period prior to germination. This process is known as a stratification period. Most seed may be purchased already
stratified. Stratified WSG seed and forbs should be planted between April 15 – June 30. Check with the supplier to
determine if any seed will require stratification or specific storage methods prior to planting. Unstratified seed may be
planted in the fall (November 15 – March 1). However, this method is not recommended due to the low success rates and
