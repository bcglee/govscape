Site Preparation (Select method)
A. Site Preparation for No-Till Method
(cid:13)
Replacement of tall fescue or orchardgrass with WSG plantings:
1. Mow or graze very low in late winter for a spring treatment or late summer for a fall treatment.
2. Allow the fescue to green up to a height of at least six inches.
3. Spray the field with an approved herbicide. For spring treatments, wait two weeks after the initial spraying. If there is still green
fescue, spot spray the problem areas. For fall treatments, spray during fall green-up then wait until the next spring and spot spray
if needed.
4. After a good kill is achieved, establish WSG. Additional requirements:
(cid:134) Graze or mow as low as possible to remove as much of the existing vegetation as possible. Apply an approved herbicide to
kill existing vegetation at the rate recommended by VCE in the fall on or by _____________ (date). Apply a second
application on remaining vegetation after spring green-up once vegetation has reached 4-6 inches on or by _____________
(date). Follow all label precautions and directions. Wait a minimum of two weeks or as directed by the product label and
plant. Additional requirements:
B. Site Preparation for Conventional Method
(cid:134) The seedbed should be prepared by disking and/or plowing to a depth of 4-6 inches. After disking, make at least one trip
over the field using a cultipacker to firm the seedbed. Ensure that the seedbed is dry and firm to obtain the proper planting
depth. Wet soils should not be cultipacked or planted. Additional requirements:
Planting Method (select method)
(cid:134) No-Till Drill Establish vegetation according to the specified seeding rate of ________ lbs/acre PLS. Seed should be drilled
¼ inch deep uniformly over the area. Smooth seeded species like switchgrass may be planted using a conventional drill.
Other species may require a modified or specialized drill. Check depth of seed frequently during planting. Additional
requirements:
(cid:134) Seed should be broadcast at a rate of _______ lbs/ac PLS. Fluffy seed (Indiangrass, big and little bluestem) should be
broadcast with a drop spreader. If using a cyclone type spreader, a carrier should be used to help distribute the seed. The
following carriers may be used: pelletized lime at a 200 lbs/acre rate; wheat at a 40 lbs/acre rate; or oats at 32 lbs/acre rate.
Since fluffy seed will only broadcast as far as the carrier, make sure your passes overlap to ensure even coverage. If wheat
or oats are used as a carrier, mow them prior to seed head formation. Additional requirements:
