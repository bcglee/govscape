See planting specifications on pages 5 & 6 for the specific recommendations for your farm.
Weed Control before Planting
Native WSG seedlings are slow to establish. Weed control prior to planting and during the first two years are critical to
success. In most situations, control should begin prior to the seeding and seedbed operations. Either conventional seedbed
preparation or herbicide application/s or both may be used to control weeds prior to establishment. When using pesticides,
consult your local Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE) agent for specific pesticide recommendations or the VCE Pest
Management Guide located @ http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/pmg/. Always follow the label instructions when using
pesticides.
Operation and Maintenance
Be prepared to allow enough time for stand establishment prior to harvest or grazing of the stand, which may take as long
as three years for native WSG.
Weed Control during the Establishment Period
Weed control during the establishment period may be accomplished by mechanical (mowing or disking) or by chemical
methods. Competition control remains an important part of native WSG establishment for up to three years after planting.
Never apply nitrogen to native WSGs during the planting year. This encourages unwanted vegetation and weed
competition. Lime may be applied at recommended levels. Fertilization of WSG often results in stands becoming too
dense for optimum wildlife use. Consider the need and use of fertilizers carefully for native WSG.
Planting Year
Mow the planting as needed to control weeds. As a general rule, never allow weeds to exceed 18 inches or form seed
heads. Mow at a height of 4 to 6 inches or just above seedling height. A “wickbar” or similar device may be used to
selectively apply herbicides. Selective or post-emergent herbicides may be sprayed over the planting to control specific
weeds. Herbicides are most effective when weeds are young and actively growing. Many WSGs and wildflowers are not
post-emergent herbicide tolerant (e.g. switchgrass). Fertilize bermudagrass according to soil test recommendations.
Unlike native WSG, bermudagrass will respond to fertilization, particularly nitrogen, throughout the stand life.
Second and Third Year after Planting
Plantings should be inspected in the early spring. If unwanted vegetation or weeds comprise more than 25 percent of the
stand, either treat with an appropriate post-emergent herbicide or keep the area mowed very short until the WSG start to
green up. Throughout the growing season, mow as needed above the seedling height to prevent weeds from overtaking the
stand. Apply lime, phosphorus, and potassium only if soil tests indicate that they are needed (i.e. pH is less than 5.5, or P
and K test results are in the "low" range). Where feasible, delay any management activities of the area until conclusion of
the primary nesting period*(April 1 – June 15). Bermudagrass may be hayed or grazed in this period. Do not overgraze.
Fourth Year after Planting (Native WSG only)
By the fourth year, the stand should be well established. Manage livestock, maintain weed control, and monitor stand
density for the intended purpose for the life of the stand. Established stands do not require frequent attention, but periodic
disturbance and or grazing is necessary to stimulate growth of desirable vegetation and to eliminate encroachment of
woody vegetation. The type and frequency of management will depend on the purpose of the planting. For optimum
wildlife habitat, all management practices should be conducted outside the primary nesting season* (April 15 - Aug 15).
Management and maintenance activities may include mowing or haying, weed control, grazing, light disking, and in some
instances prescribed burning to rejuvenate the stand. Phosphorus and/or potassium may be applied moderately where
desired or needed. Careful consideration should be given to the application of nitrogen. If nitrogen is required, apply
according to a soils test or use 40 to 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre split in two applications: one as growth of the WSG
begins and the second in mid-summer.
