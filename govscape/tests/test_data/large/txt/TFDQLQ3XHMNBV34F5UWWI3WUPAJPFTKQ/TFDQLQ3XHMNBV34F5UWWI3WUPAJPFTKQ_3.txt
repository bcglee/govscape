Grazing
Controlled grazing is a very effective WSG management tool. Livestock may be used to manipulate stand density and
remove residue. This method may provide excellent pasture and forage; however, strict management of the livestock is
required to insure the stand integrity and wildlife value. This technique should only be performed in accordance with a
grazing plan and should include wildlife as the primary or secondary objective of native WSG stands. The rate of removal
of WSG forage is determined by how many head of livestock are placed on the stand and how long they are allowed to
graze the stand. Native WSG grasses should only be grazed to a minimum height of 12 inches or livestock should not
graze more than ½ of the above ground height. Under a rotational grazing system, there must be sufficient time for grass
to recover. The optimum rest period for native WSG is 42 to 49 days. A minimum of 10 inches growth should occur in the
fall in order for plants to build root reserves for wintering and initiating spring growth. As a general rule, WSG should not
be grazed 30 days prior to the first killing frost to provide this reserve. This residual growth is excellent winter roosting
cover and nesting the following spring.
Prescribed Burning (Native WSG only)
Historically, WSG have existed with and adapted to fire. Wildlife managers continue to use fire to manage WSG. This
method is the best way to remove thatch or residue from prior growth, reduce invasion of woody species, and stimulate
forb growth. To conduct a prescribed burn in Virginia, a written burn plan must be prepared by a Certified
Prescribed Burner Manager who has completed the Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF) Certified Prescribed
Burner Managers Program. Refer to the Virginia Conservation Practice Standard Prescribed Burning (Code 338) for
more information. In Virginia it may be difficult to manage warm season grasses with fire due to burning regulations,
weather conditions, slope, topography, and liability. Untrained individuals should never attempt this method of
management. Contact the Virginia Division of Forestry for current information concerning certified burn managers,
permits and burning laws. Where possible, a WSG stand should be burned once every three to four years between January
1 and March 1.
Mowing and Haying
Mowing or haying not only provides forage, but can be used to control woody growth and remove plant matter (residue).
Residue left on the surface will eventually smother the new growth. Cutting the stand for hay provides forage and is an
excellent method to remove residue. On sites where soils are too wet in the spring to mow, harvest may be performed in
the fall after the grasses are dormant. In order to allow a sufficient recovery period before winter dormancy, grasses
should be allowed to reach a minimum height of 10 inches before the first killing frost. To maximize wildlife benefits,
mow on a 2 to 3 year rotation to control woody growth. Where feasible, mow only ⅓ to ½ of the stand each year. The
remaining areas will provide year-round wildlife food and cover.
Light Disking (Native WSG only)
If wildlife is the primary objective, occasional light disking may reduce the density of the WSG plants and provide
openings in the planting for movement of wildlife. It may also encourage the germination of wild herbaceous plants.
Disking should occur on a 3 to 4 year rotation. Preferably disk only ⅓ to ½ of the stand each year.
*The nesting season of April 15 – Aug 15 consists of two or more nesting periods. It is always best for birds and other wildlife utilizing the WSG to
remain undisturbed during the primary nesting period of April 1-June 15 or the renesting period, June 16 – August 15. If this is not possible, the
disturbance should be minimized as much as possible. It should be noted that if you participate in a USDA conservation program to establish WSG,
there may be limitations to the use of the grass during the entire nesting season after the establishment period.
