low germination with the exception of eastern gamagrass which may be planted in the winter to allow environmental
scarification of the seed. Legumes can also be overseeded during the fall or spring after a warm season grass planting.
(Annual legumes should only be seeded during the spring.) WSG usually has a lower germination rate than cool season
species; therefore, it is essential when purchasing and planting WSG that the quantities of seed be based on Pure Live
Seed (PLS).
Seedbed and Site Preparation
Stands may be established either by conventional or no-till methods. No-till establishment is the preferred method since
there is minimum soil disturbance, thus reducing weed competition and soil erosion. Regardless of the seeding method
used, care should be taken to avoid planting the seed too deep. Seeding depth should never exceed ¼ inch with 1/8 depth
recommended in the coastal plain. Planting deeper than ¼ inch will almost always fail. Lime and fertilizer applications,
will be applied according to the recommendations of an approved soil testing facility. If soil erosion is a concern during
the establishment period, then it is highly recommended using a no-till method of planting. This will protect the soil in the
field and reduce the potential off-site effects of soil erosion. Avoid no-till planting or cultipacking in wet soil since it may
result in improper seed placement and planting failure.
When seeding by conventional methods, plowing and disking should be done deep enough to kill all existing vegetation
and to incorporate lime and fertilizer into the top 4 – 6 inches of soil. Any rills and gullies should be eliminated. The
surface should be reasonably smooth, free of ridges, rocks, and other obstructions and a firm seedbed prepared. A dry,
firm seedbed is critical to avoid planting seed too deep and to ensure good seed-to-soil contact. The seeding may be done
with a drill, cultipacker seeder, cyclone seeder or other suitable equipment. The seed should be covered no more than ¼
inches in a firm seedbed. A roller or cultipacker will ensure a good seed-to-soil contact. Cultipack or roll the seeded area
only once to ensure good seed-to-soil contact and the proper seeding depth. Conventional seeding may be used for
establishment on areas that have been recently cropped, where weedy competition will be reduced, and where the risk of
soil erosion is minimal. Broadcast seed shall be spread in a uniform manner and should always be cultipacked after
seeding. No more than ⅓ of the seed should be visible on the soil surface. Broadcast fluffy seed (big and little bluestem
and Indiangrass) with a drop or cyclone type spreader. A carrier may be used to help distribute the seed. The following
carriers may be used: lime at 200 lbs/acre; wheat at 40 lbs/acre; or oats at 32 lbs/acre. Wind speed should be minimal
when using this method.
When seeding by no-till methods, care needs to be exercised to ensure correct seed flow and seeding depth. Smooth
seeded species like switchgrass may be planted using a conventional drill. Species such as little bluestem, big bluestem
and Indiangrass will require a specialized no-till drill or a modified conventional drill that contains a fluff box. Specialized
drills have seed boxes with dividers, agitators and oversized drop tubes and may be adjusted for shallow planting depths.
Calibrate the drill and when planting, check the seeding depth often to avoid planting too deep. Do not pull the drill too
fast.
Seed must be placed in firm contact with the mineral soil at a depth of ¼ to ½ inch. Depth control bands or other controls
should be used to ensure proper placement of seed. Packer wheels are essential. Eliminate competitive vegetation by
heavy grazing, mowing and/or herbicides. Undesirable species should be controlled by applying a suitable herbicide at
least two weeks before the seeding date. To maintain stand integrity, pesticides may be applied to control undesirable and
harmful infestations. Effects on beneficial insects and wildlife will be considered prior to applications.
All seed will conform to minimum state standards for purity, germination, and other features. Never compromise seed
quality. Seed tags and other information may be requested by an NRCS representative to verify seed quality.
When planting native WSG, application of nitrogen is not recommended.
Common bermudagrass and its hybrids may be established by seeding or with sprigs. Lime and fertilize according to soils
test. Bermudagrass responds vigorously to nitrogen applications.
