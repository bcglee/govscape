U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement
Texas Farmers Will Benefit
September 2008
The United States concluded free trade negotiations with Korea on April 1, 2007. The U.S.-
Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) is the most commercially significant free trade
agreement the United States has negotiated in nearly 20 years.
The KORUS FTA provides immediate elimination of duties on more than 60 percent of current
U.S. exports and gives U.S. exporters improved access to the Korean market for many of the
products that have been highly protected. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates
that annual U.S. agricultural exports to Korea will increase by a minimum of $1.9 billion upon
full implementation of the agreement.
The agreement eliminates tariffs and other barriers on most agricultural products, increasing
export opportunities for a range of Texas’ agricultural products, including beef, poultry, and
dairy. Texas exports to all countries, estimated at $5.2 billion in 2007, supported about 55,416
jobs, both on and off the farm. These export sales make an important contribution to Texas’
farm economy, which had total cash receipts of $19 billion in 2007.
Beef. The cattle and calf industry is the state’s largest agricultural industry with cash receipts of
$7.6 billion or 40 percent of farm earnings in 2007. Texas is the nation’s fourth largest exporter
of live animals and meat. The cattle industry will benefit from this FTA.
• For beef muscle meats, the FTA provides a 15-year straight-line tariff phase out with a
safeguard that begins growing from 270,000 tons, a quantity that is 17 percent larger than
our largest historical shipments.
• Technical consultations continue toward the goal of allowing imports to take place
consistent with World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines.
• Following the May 2007 decision by the OIE classifying the United States as a
controlled-risk country, Korea has announced that it will undertake in a timely manner its
regulatory process toward expansion of market access for beef and beef products.
Poultry Meat. Broilers are the fifth largest source of farm cash receipts with sales of $1.4
billion in 2007. Texas poultry producers and processors will gain from this agreement.
