• Korea’s tariffs of 18 to 27 percent on frozen leg quarters, frozen breasts and wings, and
frozen turkey cuts, will be phased out in 7 to 12 years.
• As the number two market for U.S. egg products, Korean tariffs of 27 percent on egg
products, including egg yolks, will be phased out in 12 equal annual reductions.
Dairy Products. Dairy products are the fourth largest source of farm cash receipts in Texas with
$1.4 billion in 2007. The Texas dairy industry will benefit from the Korea agreement.
• The FTA will provide immediate duty-free access for double the current export volume
of total dairy products. Duty-free quotas will be established for cheese, skim/whole milk
powder, food whey, and butter.
• Current annual U.S. feed whey exports of $8 million will gain duty-free access to the
Korean market immediately upon implementation.
Cotton. The cotton industry is the state’s second largest agricultural industry with cash receipts
of $2.1 billion, or 11 percent of farm earnings, in 2007.
• The FTA will lock in the duty-free access being enjoyed by U.S. cotton exporters. This
permanent access allows U.S. cotton exports to continue to compete on a level playing
field with Korea’s other trading partners.
Fruits, Vegetables, and Products. Fruits and vegetables and related products are an important
part of Texas agricultural exports, accounting for an estimated $123 million in 2007.
• Tariffs on frozen orange juice, asparagus, canned and processed tomatoes, frozen potato
fries, and chipping potatoes (during the U.S. potato shipping season) will become duty
free immediately.
• Many other products such as avocados, lemons, grapefruit, carrots, lettuce, dried
mushrooms, and sweet corn will see duties ranging from 30 to 45 percent eliminated in 2
to 10 years.
• For oranges, the FTA establishes front-loaded seasonal (March-August) tariff cuts that
benefit 70 percent of exports through an immediate reduction from 50 to 30 percent and a
7-year phase out. Access for shipments earlier in the year is provided through a duty-free
quota.
