programs. However, in most experimental studies, insects are exposed to various diets containing
IGRs which does not mimic actual exposure conditions in the field. Mature larvae (last instar) of
the red flour beetle and the confused flour beetle were exposed to the IGR hydroprene on
concrete treated with the label rate for either 8 to 144 hours or they were continuously exposed
on concrete treated with 25, 50, 75, or 100% of the label rate. Larvae were held at either 27 or 32
oC and 40%, 57%, or 75% relative humidity. Temperature effects were variable; however, the
best control was obtained when larvae were continually exposed at 75% relative humidity. These
results indicate that continual exposure of mature larvae to hydroprene can arrest the
development of both the red and the confused flour beetles, but exposure intervals in excess of 6
days may be required for maximum effectiveness. (Frank Arthur, telephone: 785-776-2783,

Desiccant Dusts Increase the Effectiveness of Pathogenic Fungi in Controlling Insect Pests.
l
Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a desiccant insecticide that abrades and absorbs lipids from the
exterior of insects. It is most effective for insect pest control at low humidity. Beauveria bassiana
is a fungus that is pathogenic to insects which it infects by penetrating the outer layers of the
insect pest. It is most effective at high humidity. Stored-grain beetles were exposed to several
concentrations of this pathogenic fungus both in the presence and absence of DE or other
abrasives such as silicon or diamond dusts. These experiments showed that a combination of the
fungus and dust together was significantly more effective than either control method separately.

GMPRC Continues to Develop New Customer Alert System. We are continuing our efforts to
l
develop a specific customer notification system which will be used to alert customers when we
have research results of particular interest to them. This is an electronic system that is based on
electronic mail. If you are interested, please fill out a customer “interest profile” electronically
through a special web page located at: http://www.gmprc.ksu.edu./survey.html. Once we have
your interest profile and your email address, whenever we have results that fall into your
particular area of interest, we will send you a brief electronic message alerting you to the results
and identifying the contact person here at GMPRC who will be able to provide additional details.
We currently are sending these message alerts on a weekly basis to provide more rapid access to
research results from GMPRC. As always, we welcome your comments and suggestions
concerning how we can improve our services. (Don Koeltzow, Center Director, telephone: 1-800-
