Genetic Studies of Insect Development May Lead To Better Control Methods. Increasing
l
restrictions on pesticide use combined with the development of insect resistance to current
control methods, make it necessary to produce alternative control techniques to protect our food
supply in the future. One such technique may result from better knowledge of the basic genetic
regulation of insect growth and development. We have shown that when a certain gene, called the
“maxillopedia” gene, is eliminated in the red flour beetle, the mouth parts that are needed for
feeding develop as legs. Therefore, larvae from these insects are unable to feed and they die of
starvation shortly after hatching. In another instance, we have shown that when another gene is
eliminated in the red flour beetle, the mouth parts develop as antennae. Again, these embryos die
before they hatch because they are unable to chew their way out of the egg. Finding ways to
disrupt important developmental genes such as these may lead to the development of potent new
tools for controlling the red flour beetle and other insects. (Dick Beeman, telephone: 785-776-

NIR Analysis May Be Useful In Separating Single Kernels of Corn. A diode-array Near-
l
Infrared Spectrometer (NIR) was used to rapidly analyze single kernels of corn for the presence
of attributes such as BGY fluorescence (an indicator of the presence of aflatoxin producing
fungi), aflatoxin and fumonisin mycotoxins, fusarium (mycotoxin producing fungal species), and
avidin (a protein from chicken eggs). NIR spectra could be highly correlated with BGY
fluorescence. Transgenic corn kernels containing the gene from chicken eggs that produced high
levels of avidin could be identified based on NIR absorption characteristics. Data from the
correlation of NIR spectra to aflatoxin and fumonisin content and to the presence of fusarium
fungi are being analyzed and will show the potential for NIR instruments to detect these
important quality attributes in corn. (Floyd Dowell, telephone: 785-776-2753, email:

Insect Growth Regulator Effectiveness Tested on Concrete. Insect growth regulators (IGRs)
l
are chemicals that prevent larvae from reaching the adult stage or produce deformed adults that
are unable to reproduce. These chemicals have potential for expanded use in modern pest control
