Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
During the second growing season, expect abundant catkin production and enough seeds for
large-scale seedling production. By fall, all remaining stock plants are transplanted to the seed
orchardâ€“males and females can be mixed to enhance pollination.
The process is similar if seeds are collected. Frequent field observations of willow stands of
known species will allow seed collection if female plants are present and are flowering or
dispersing seeds. If collection sites are remote, it may be possible to identify and tag female
plants a year in advance and estimate seed maturation date by observing catkin development so
that a well-timed collection trip will yield ripe catkins the following year. Seeds can be cleaned
and seedlings grown as described below. Seedlings generally grow the first year in SC-10s and
are transplanted into 1GTPs during winter or spring. The plants can be tagged for gender after
catkins appear which can be as early as the second year for early maturing species (for example,
S. bebbiana, S. irrorata, S. scouleriana). Once the sex is know, plants can be moved to the seed
orchard as described above.
Other Considerations That May Affect Riparian Planting Stock
Production
The difficulties encountered in getting an accurate species identification for Salix species may
complicate restoration activities; however, the lack of positive identification should not
necessarily stop propagation endeavors. In addition, the stock size for outplanting will greatly
influence the lead time needed to produce plant materials for a riparian restoration project.
Figure 3: Three soil sieves are needed to clean seeds. The bottom sieve is where the seeds collect. Cotton and seeds
are placed in the middle sieve. The top sieve holds the cotton from blowing out when ta stream of compressed air is
blown across it. The cotton remains in the middle sieve and clean seeds are deposited on the bottom.
Positive species identification is obviously preferred for any propagation activity. A case can be
made, however, that because of the difficulty in willow species identification an alternative
approach may be acceptable if: 1) the willows are determined to be native or any exotic willows
can be readily identified and disregarded; 2) the willows are collected from the watershed to be
restored; 3) the growth characteristics of the willow species present in the watershed are
appropriate for the restoration purpose and are consistent with the vast majority of .the future
planting sites; and 4) if necessary, propagules can be collected and kept separate for each
individual wild stock plant throughout the propagation process. This final recommendation will
allow the seedlings of an individual species to be differentiated at outplanting in case more than 1
