Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
Apache plume deeper in the profile at 20 cm from the base of the plant. Although fertilization
decreased survival of Apache plume, its effect on shoot growth and root density suggests that the
treatments were not as detrimental to the plant's performance as it was in serviceberry. Species
were analyzed separately in this study; however, comparisons as to their response to fertilization
at time of planting are important for future decisions about species selection and revegetation
designs.
Fertilizer applications at time of planting may increase the establishment of herbaceous species
(annuals, grasses, and forbs), which can negatively impact (for example, nutrient and water
competition) survival and shoot and root growth of transplanted shrubs and trees (Cook and
others 1974). Although not measured, plots fertilized at time of planting did have an observable
increase of volunteer herbaceous plants (grasses and annual forbs) compared to control plots in
2000. It is not known when these plants became established, but favorable conditions did exist for
them to establish within these plots. Favorable conditions may include fertilizer applications and
lack of root competition near the soil surface (<20 cm), since both species fertilized at time of
planting allocated a greater portion of roots deeper in the soil than at the surface. However,
further evaluations are needed to determine whether the observed root response in both species
was due directly to fertilizer applications or indirectly from competition from volunteer plants, or
both.
Conclusions
Although overall performance in terms of shoot growth was positive for both species when
fertilized at time of planting, other fertilizer related factors will need to be investigated to enhance
establishment, growth, and long- term survival of plants planted directly into mine overburden at
high elevations. Slow-release fertilizer formulation, release rate and total amount applied should
be investigated more closely. While these factors have been investigated in other systems (Fan
and others 2002; Walker 1999a,b), the impact of these treatments on plants at high elevations
(>2,500 m) remains largely unknown.
Additional factors, which need further investigation, are related to fertilizer treatments for high
elevation planting and include time of planting relative to the end of the growing season. Previous
studies at this mine indicate two periods suitable, in terms of available moisture, for transplanting.
These are during the midsummer rain period and in early fall. Incorporation of fertilizer, in
particular nitrogen fertilizer, on fall plantings is not recommended; however, further work is
warranted to look at planting and fertilizing earlier in the growing season than was performed in
this study. The effects of incorporating slow- release fertilizer at this time will impact plant
response. Too slow a release rate or too short a timeframe to the end of the growing season may
increase mortality rates. Transplanting in midsummer, as recommended by Fisher and others
(1983), may have prevented mortality in both species when fertilized. Timed properly this
treatment can result in larger, more vigorous plants.
