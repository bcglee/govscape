Study Number: NMPMC-P-9504-CR
New Mexico feathergrass and needleandthread are native, perennial, cool-season grasses that are
tolerant to only 8–10 inches of annual precipitation. They provide fair-to-good forage for
livestock and wildlife. However, their flower has long awns, and it may prove injurious to
livestock. Both are commonly found on calcareous and sandy soils. The breeding system of
needleandthread is self-pollination. New Mexico feathergrass also appears to be primarily self-
pollinating.
Seed from six New Mexico feathergrass and 61 needleandthread accessions were obtained from
bulk seed collections throughout New Mexico, Arizona, and Montana. In 1985, these bulk
collections were established in a field at the LLPMC and into non-replicated accession plots. The
plots consisted of two rows of 14 plants each. Fifteen needleandthread accessions and three New
Mexico feathergrass accessions were selected based on survival, foliage height, basal width and
visual vigor. Seed was bulk harvested from all plants of the selected accessions.
In 1994, a replicated entry evaluation of the selected accessions was established at two sites at the
LLPMC. The experimental units consisted of a plot containing two plants. The experiment at
both sites was conducted in a randomized complete block with nine replications. Site #1 had
salinity levels ranging from 3.3 to 4.5 mmhos, cm-1, and Site #2 ranged from 0.42 to 0.44 mmhos,
cm-1. In 1996, Site #1 was abandoned because the site was weedy, and a majority of the plants
had died possibly due to the high soil salinity. Site #2 did well and contains healthy plants.
In 2005, superior plants will be selected from the 18 remaining accessions. Plants from both
species will be selected, vegetatively increased, and planted into two separate seed increase fields
for continued testing. This testing will include off-center plantings.
2004 Treatment and Harvest
Weed control was performed throughout growing season to keep the field clean and to promote
vigorous growth of the planting. No evaluations were made in 2004.
