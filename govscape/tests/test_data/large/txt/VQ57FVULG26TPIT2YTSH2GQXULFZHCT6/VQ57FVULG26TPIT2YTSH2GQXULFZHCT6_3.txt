Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
Introduction
New Mexico State and Federal laws require that mined lands be reclaimed to support a
designated post-mining land use (State of New Mexico 1999). Forestry as a post mining land use
has been encouraged by regulatory agencies since the mid- to late-1990s (Boyce 1999). Metal
mines within the mountainous Western United States including the Molycorp, Inc. molybdenum
mine near Questa, NM, are selecting forestry as a post mine land use to re-establish a plant
community comparable to adjacent native vegetation.
Open-pit mining at the molybdenum mine generated over 300 million metric tons of overburden
from 1965 until 1983. The overburden exists in piles that range in altitude from 2,400 to 3,000 in
and are composed of mixed igneous rocks (rhyolite and andesite) and black andesite and aplite
materials (referred to as neutral rock). Mine overburden can be low in organic matter, soil micro-
organisms, and plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and can lack soil structure and
texture that are important to soil fertility and water holding capacity (Allen 1989; Feagley 1985).
These properties make it challenging for plants to establish, thus overburden or plant amendments
are often recommended (Brown and others 1996; Gardiner 1993).
Research studies on the survival of directly transplanted trees and shrubs on the overburden began
in the early 1990s (Harrington and others 2001a,b,c). These studies indicated that the overburden
was suitable to support plant life, in terms of transplant survival. In most instances, however,
shoot growth was limited. Other research has shown that shoot growth of newly transplanted tree
and shrub seedlings can benefit from supplemental fertilization in both minimally disturbed (Fan
and others 2002; Houle and Babeux 1994; Walker 1999a) and drastically disturbed ecosystems
(Fisher and others 1983; Voeller and others 1998; Walker 1999b). Growth response to fertilizer
application, however, can be both species specific (Voeller and others 1998; Houle and Babeux
1994) and site specific (Gleason and others 1990).
The ability of transplanted seedlings to establish new roots into a planting medium is essential to
their survival and subsequent growth. Plants with a well-established root system add to the
success of post mine revegetation, control erosion, and improve overall post mine conditions.
Most fertilization studies, however, focus primarily on shoot growth characteristics and disregard
belowground growth. Early plantings of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at the Molycorp, Inc.
Mine were evaluated for root growth after 6 years of growth. Rooting depth of some plants
extended beyond 2 m in the overburden (Harrington, unpublished data). This observation led to
questions regarding growth allocation of directly transplanted trees and shrubs at the Molycorp,
Inc. Mine with fertilization treatments.
This study evaluated the influence of fertilization at time of planting on root distribution and
growth of two native woody shrubs, Saskatoon serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia) (hereafter
referred to as serviceberry) and Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), transplanted into overburden
at the Molycorp, Inc. Questa Mine. Root densities and distributions were described at six depths
and three distances from the base of each plant to examine the effects of fertilizer applications at
the time of planting.
Materials and Methods
Site Description
Molycorp, Inc., molybdenum mine is located near Questa, NM, in the Red River Canyon and
produces the largest amount of molybdenum in the state (Schilling 1965, State of New Mexico
1999). Overburden from open-pit mining was deposited on the steep mountainsides of Red River
Canyon. The overburden piles are highly heterogeneous, consisting of parent materials with a
range of acidic and soluble salt levels (Steffan and Kirsten 1995).
