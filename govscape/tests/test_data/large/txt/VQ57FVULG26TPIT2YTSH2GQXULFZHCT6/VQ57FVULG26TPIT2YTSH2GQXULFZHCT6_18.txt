Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
Seedling Growth Rates For Several Willow Species
Examples of height and root collar diameter (caliper) growth for several willow species grown in
SC-10s with moderate CRF rates are described below as well as for Salix exigua (Nutt.) in larger
intermediate containers with high CRF rates. The growth enhancement provided by larger
containers with high nutrient levels has been confirmed during the 2003 production season for
other species including S. irrorata and S. bebbiana. One aspect of this willow seedling growth
data requires explanation–for some species, seeds from stock plants of montane species grown in
the desert environment of the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center (elevation 1463 m [4800 ft]) have
been used. It appears, based on the range of willow seed dispersal dates presented by Zasada and
others (2000), that seeds are generally produced in our seed orchard at least I mo earlier than
would be expected from wild collections of montane willows. An example of a typical SC-10 and
IGTP are provided in Figure 5.
Salix irrorata
Male and female cuttings of S. irrorata were collected from the Wilderness District of the Gila
National Forest in southwestern New Mexico and rooted at the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center
nursery. After 1 y, stock plants
growing in IGTP containers were
tagged by sex and then
transplanted into a seed orchard
established in organic rich nursery
beds. After 4 y, stock plants were
7 m tall. Seedlings (sown in late
April–early May) growing in SC-
10 containers for 1 growing
season averaged 62 cm (24 in) in
height and 5 mm (0.2 in) in
caliper measured at the top of the
container. After transplanting and
growing in 1GTPs for another
year, plants averaged 2.6 m (8.5
ft) in height and 14 mm (0.5.5 in)
of caliper.
Salix bebbiana
In March 2001, USDA Forest
Service personnel collected S.
bebbiana cuttings from 2 stands at
approximately 2400 m (7875 ft)
elevation, and in June they
collected seeds from a wild stand
(2700 m [8860 ft]) on the Apache-
Sitgreaves National Forest in east
central Arizona. The cuttings were
stuck into 1GTP and the following
year (2002) they produced seeds.
Seedlings were grown I1y in SC-
