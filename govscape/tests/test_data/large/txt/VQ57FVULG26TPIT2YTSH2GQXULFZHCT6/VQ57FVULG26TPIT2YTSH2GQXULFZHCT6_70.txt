on sandy topsoil in August 2005.
Of the 700 New Mexico olive tall pot transplants, 609 plants were found. The plants averaged a
93% survival rate (Figure 14). The inundation did not have a significant impact on New Mexico
olive tall pot survival. These plants can tolerate this extended period of inundation.
Figure 13: Coyote willow pole cuttings (center) four months after planting
in the high-flow channel in August 2005.
Of the 100 skunkbush sumac that was planted, 90 plants were located. Skunkbush sumac tall pot
transplants averaged an 8 percent survival. Every plant that was inundated for the extended
period died. Only those plants that were planted on high ground survived.
