Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
Introduction
The Salicaceae consists of hundreds of species of woody trees, shrubs, and subshrubs but contains
only 2 genera: the willows (Salix spp. L.) (Zasada and others 2003) and the poplars, cottonwoods,
and aspens (Populus spp. L.) (Wycoff and Zasada 2003). This plant family is noteworthy for
several reasons: 1) individual plants are dioecious (each plant is either male or female)â€“rarely are
plants both (hermaphroditic) (Rowland and others 2002; Zasada and others 2003); 2) members of
the Salicaceae are keystone species in many riparian plant communities; and 3) they are
commonly propagated by cuttings rather than seeds. Between 300 and 500 species of Salix and 36
species of Populus exist, with centers of species diversity being in the north temperate and
subarctic regions of the world.
Demand for willow and cottonwood plant
materials has been increasing greatly in the
last decade because of an increased interest in
riparian restoration. A wide variety of plant
materials of Salix and Populus are being
utilized (Figure 1), and most of these use
hardwood cuttings as propagules. In the
western US, we use a large range of sizes of
hardwood cuttings for stabilizing and
revegetating stream banks (Table 1). Note that
five stakes are stuck directly in stream banks,
and the branched cuttings used in
bioengineering structures like brush
mattresses, fascines, and vertical bundles are
expected to root, stabilize soil, and eventually
revegetate the site (Dreesen and others 2002;
Hoag and Landis 2002). This is vegetative
propagation, and like all forms of vegetative
propagation, has serious consequences.
The Problem
The ultimate objective of any restoration
project is to produce a plant community with
A rooted cutting of Salix drummondiana Barratt ex- the greatest possible genetic diversity, and one
Hook (Salicaceae). that is also self-sustaining. Our concern is that
all of the above uses of willow and poplar
involve cuttings and therefore vegetative propagation (see Live Stakes, An Opportunity on Page
27). The Salicaceae are ideal for cuttings because, with the exception of quaking aspen (Populus
tremuloides Michx.) and Scouler willow (Salix scoulerana Barratt Ex Hook.) in the northern
Rocky Mountains (Edson and others 1995), they root very easily. Sexual propagation is preferred,
however, in restoration projects because seeds contain a mixture of genetic characteristics so that
offspring will consist of both male and female plants. In contrast, vegetative propagation
produces exact clones of the mother plant. This is of particular concern with dioecious plants,
such as Salix and Populus, because all the progeny produced by vegetative propagation will have
the same sex as their parent (Figure 2). If care is not taken to collect cuttings from a broad area,
genetic diversity may also suffer.
Most restorationists and nursery workers collect dormant cuttings of willow and cottonwood
without any consideration to the sex of the parent plant. In nature, these species often reproduce
