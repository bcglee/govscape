Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
Figure 3: The sex of willows and cottonwoods can easily be determined when the plants are in flower or fruiting (A =
willow male, B = willow female, C = willow fruit).
Collecting Propagules
Labeling plants of known sex also makes it easy to come back and collect seeds from females. It
is also important to identify the species, especially in the willows. Cottonwood flowers in spring
(Wycoff and Zasada 2003) but willows can be divided into species producing seeds in the spring
or summer and those that disperse seeds in fall (Zasada and others 2003). Seeds can be processed
and sown in either bareroot beds or containers (see Dawes 2003; Day and others 2003; Dreesen
2003). We have found it better to sow seeds of spring and summer flowering willows
immediately but seeds from fall flowering willows have a cold dormancy requirement that may
require cold-moist stratification (Zasada and others 2003).
If you are unable to make frequent visits to the restoration site when seeds are maturing, another
option is to bring stem cuttings of known male and female plants back to the nursery and force
them to produce seeds (Figure 1). These cuttings should be collected during the winter dormant
season when rooting success is highest and floral buds are completely formed. The trick is to be
able to distinguish male and female plants at this time, and to collect mature cuttings with floral
buds.
Forcing Seed Production in the Nursery
Branches with floral buds can be placed in buckets of water and incubated in a greenhouse until
they flower. The water should be changed 2 to 3 times per week and with each change the ends of
the branches should be recut to improve water uptake. Flowering usually takes place in 2 to 4 wk
and then pollination can be induced (Wycoff and Zasada 2003). Populus species are wind
pollinated so good air movement will result in pollination, but willows require insects to pollinate
flowersâ€“therefore insects must have access to willow flowers or flowers must be pollinated by
hand.
Another more long-term option is to root branch cuttings in containers being careful to maintain
sexual identity, and then mix male and female plants in the growing area to facilitate fertilization.
This procedure also allows mixing of plants from across the project area, ensuring a better genetic
