Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
mixing than would occur naturally. Many willows are sexually precocious and will produce
flowers that same season, and both willows and cottonwoods (if collected from mature branches)
should flower the following year. The timing of pollen release and pistil receptivity may vary
considerably among male and female cutting collections which emphasizes the need for sampling
sufficient numbers of individuals to maximize the period of flowering and the chances of
pollination. Because plants are growing in close proximity, the percentage of seed set is high and
quality seeds can be collected a month or so after flowering.
To ensure good seed quality, collect female capsules just before they open (Figure 3C) and place
them in a brown paper bag to afterripen. When the cotton is just emerging from the capsules,
seeds can be separated by using screens and compressed air. Cottonwood seeds can be processed
by hammer-milling the capsules and separating the seeds with screens at low air flow. The exact
procedure, including screen sizes, is given in Dreesen and others (2002), Wycoff and Zasada
(2003), and Zasada and others (2003).

hundreds to tens-of-thousands of nonrooted willow cuttings can be used for New Mexico is
live stakes or branched cuttings for bioengineering structures. Besides
shown in Figure 5. If
providing stability, these cuttings sprout and become pioneer plants. If the
the dormant
sex of the donor willows is not considered during cutting collection, the
sexual diversity of the plant community can be seriously compromised. hardwood cuttings are
collected during
winter, they can be stuck in the nursery the following spring. The plants will flower the first or
second season and seeds can be collected and processed. By immediately sowing, shippable
seedlings can be ready by the third or fourth year, depending on the container and desired target
seedling size.
