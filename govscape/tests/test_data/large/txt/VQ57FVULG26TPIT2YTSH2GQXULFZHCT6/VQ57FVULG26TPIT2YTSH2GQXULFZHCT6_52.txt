2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Evaluation of Giant Sacation For Use In Field Windstrip Plantings
Evaluation of Giant Sacaton For Use In Field Windstrip Plantings
By: Danny Goodson1
Study Number: NMPMC-P-9801-CP
NRCS Field Offices continue to be very interested in using the giant sacation species for
windstrip plantings. In 2004, the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center (LLPMC) provided giant
sacation transplants to the field offices in Clayton, Estancia, and Grants, NM, and to the Navajo
Reservation in McKinley County and Isleta Reservation in Valencia County, New Mexico.
Distribution of these plant materials continues to promote the utility of this species for use as a
windstrip, and it additionally defines its range of adaptability.
Rancho La Frontera
The Rancho La Frontera has had two, separate giant sactaon windstrip plantings. The first was
installed in 1999-2000, and the second was installed in 2001. Both of these plantings were
evaluated in 2004. All of the plants in the 1999-2000 windstrip planting appear to be vigorous
and have produced seed heads. These plants average 8 feet in height and 40 inches in width. The
2001 windstrip planting also appears healthy, and the surviving plants are vigorous and have
produced seed heads. These plants averaged 7 ½ feet in height and 38 inches in width. The plants
that originally died in the 2001 planting have been replaced with new transplants which appear to
be healthy.
An evaluation is scheduled for 2005.
Tucumcari Windstrip Planting
The giant sacaton planting at the Tucumcari outdoor classroom appears to be healthy; all of the
plants are vigorous and have produced seed heads in 2004. The plants have averaged 4 feet in
height and 30 inches in width. These plants are not receiving any additional watering; they have
done well with just rainfall moisture. The plants do receive runoff from an adjacent paved road
and parking lot during rainfall events. Additional plants maybe installed in 2005 to expand the
windstrip area.
An evaluation is scheduled for 2005.
Bernard Lujan - lsleta Reservation
This giant sacaton windstrip was installed in July 2004 on the Bernard Lujan Farm in Isleta, New
Mexico. This windstrip will provide protection during the windy season for Mr. Lujan’s
homestead. The planting consists of a single row of giant sacaton planted 5 feet apart; it is located
on the west side of the homestead next to an irrigated alfalfa field. The giant sacaton transplants
used in the windstrip were grown at the LLPMC. This planting is part of the adaptability trial of
this native grass species for use in windstrips and will enable us to evaluate giant sacaton as a
windstrip species in this area of New Mexico. The planting showed a 100 percent survival rate at
the October 2004 evaluation. The plants had averaged 12 inches in height and 10 inches in width.
An evaluation is scheduled for 2005.
