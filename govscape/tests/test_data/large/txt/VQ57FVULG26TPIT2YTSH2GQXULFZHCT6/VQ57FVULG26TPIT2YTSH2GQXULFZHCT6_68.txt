Figure 7: The second growing season for cottonwood pole cuttings planted at the
side between the existing bosque and the MRGCD drain ditch road
covered with a 4- to 6-inch surface mulch layer of wood chips. In the
background where no surface mulching occurred, exists a dense ground
cover of annual weeds in August 2005.
The berm grass and penstemon seeding began emerging in late August of 2004 after several
rainstorms. Emerging seedlings of galleta and Indian ricegrass were the most common (Figure
8). Desert salt grass was also volunteering on the site. However, the seed bed was dominated by
high densities of Russian thistle (Salsola kali) and kochia (Kochia scoparia) seedlings. Both
plants are more competitive for light, water, and nutrients than grass seedlings. In retrospect, the
site should have had weed control applied for at least two years prior to seeding to reduce this
competition. As of August 2005, the berm is still dominated by weeds with some grass plants
present. Unlike the other species seeded, New Indian ricegrass and penstemon seedlings will
continue to emerge for the next two years.

The grass in the foreground is desert saltgrass, other grasses are mainly
galleta and Indian ricegrass.
Of the 600 pole cuttings planted in the April of 2004 (580 cottonwood and 20 western black
willow), only 384 cottonwood and 17 western black willow were found, approximately 67
percent of the plants (Figure 9). The others are in a dense forest of 10â€“12 foot kochia,
sunflowers, coyote willow and other vegetation. Of the plants that were located, the cottonwoods
averaged 84 percent survival and the western black willow averaged 76 percent survival. The 50
days of inundation did not seem to have an effect on the survival of the poles that had already
rooted one year earlier.
