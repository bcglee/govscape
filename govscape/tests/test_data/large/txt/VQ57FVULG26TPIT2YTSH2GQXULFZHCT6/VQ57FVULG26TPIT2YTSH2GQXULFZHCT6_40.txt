Sulfuric Acid Scarification Of Wax Currant Seeds From New Mexico
content (Dorne 1981), and hardness of the seed coat and endosperm (Juntilla 1973).
Microclimatic factors such as aspect, slope, vegetative cover, and edaphic conditions can affect
temperature, light quality, moisture, wind exposure, and nutrient availability. Anderson and
Milberg (1998) suggest that even seeds collected from plants growing side by side may have been
subject to different weather conditions during maturation due to small differences in development
time, and that water and nutrient status can vary within small areas. Differential response to acid
scarification among seed sources in the present study may have been mediated by microclimatic
differences, and variability among proximal sources is not surprising.
