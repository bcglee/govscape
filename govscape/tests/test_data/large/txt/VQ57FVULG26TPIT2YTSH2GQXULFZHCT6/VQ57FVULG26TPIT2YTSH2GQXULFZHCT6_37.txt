Sulfuric Acid Scarification Of Wax Currant Seeds From New Mexico
For many native shrub species, propagation techniques are not well researched, resulting in
increased production costs (Dreesen and Harrington 1997). In reclamation, locally adapted
seedlots are usually preferred, but seed crops are often limited, and the need to maximize
germination is paramount. For wax currant, the combination of acid scarification and cold
stratification may result in higher germination than cold stratification alone. The purpose of this
research was to evaluate the efficacy of sulfuric acid scarification and variability in treatment
response among wax currant seedlots encompassing both a range of latitudes throughout New
Mexico and a range of elevations at one location in northern New Mexico.
Materials And Methods
Seeds were collected 10 August 1997 through 21 August 1997 at six locations throughout New
Mexico (Table 1). Seeds were collected at varying heights within the canopy of each plant and
from a minimum of 5 plants at each location. Seedlot locations were selected to encompass both a
range of latitudes within New Mexico and a range of elevations at Molycorp Mine in Questa,
New Mexico. Before cleaning, seeds were soaked overnight in tap water (seeds that floated were
discarded), allowed to ferment for 48 h, mashed, and dried. Dried fruits were processed in a
rubbing box, and a Dakota blower was used to separate seeds from pulp. Cleaned seeds were
stored at 5° C (41º F) until use.
This study utilized a completely randomized design with a factorial treatment structure. Factors
were seedlot, scarification treatment, and cold stratification duration. Seeds from 6 seedlots
underwent acid scarification in concentrated sulfuric acid for durations of 0, 2, 4, or 8 min
followed by cold stratification for 0, 60, 90, or 120 d. Germination data were analyzed as a 6
(seedlot) by 4 (cold stratification) by 4 (scarification) factorial and then separately by seedlot.
Two replications of 100 seeds were used to test each treatment combination.
Scarification treatments were conducted using concentrated sulfuric acid (Reagent ACS, 95.0-
98.0%, VWR Scientific Products, West Chester, Pennsylvania). Each seed sample (100 seeds)
undergoing scarification was placed in 10 ml acid, stirred vigorously for 30 s to disperse the
seeds, and then allowed to soak in the acid for the remainder of the treatment duration (2, 4, or 8
min). Following treatment the seeds were removed from the acid and thoroughly rinsed under
running tap water for 1 min.
Seeds were placed between 9.0-cm (3.5-in) filter papers (VWR Qualitative Grade #3) moistened
with distilled water for cold stratification treatments. Filter papers were placed in 100-mm Petri
dishes sealed in 15 x 16 cm self-sealing poly bags within a walk-in cooler. Cooler temperatures
fluctuated from an average daily low of -1.2° C (30° F) to an average daily high of 5.4° C (42° F).
Seeds underwent cold stratification immediately following scarification. Scarification/cold
stratification start dates were staggered so that all seeds completed cold stratification at the same
time.
Seeds were maintained between filter papers in Petri dishes within poly bags for germination
testing. Petri dishes in poly bags were placed directly on greenhouse benches under natural light
(filtered through shade cloth) with fluctuating temperatures. A 30-cm (1-ft) border on all sides of
each bench was left empty in order to minimize temperature differences between samples. The
greenhouse thermostat was set to maintain daytime highs near 30° C (86° F) and nighttime lows
near 15° C (59° F). Daytime high temperatures averaged 34° C (93° F) +/- 0.5°C (0.9° F) and
nighttime low temperatures averaged 15° C (59º F) +/- 0.3° C (0.5° F) during the experiment.
Germination testing took place from 14 May 1999 through 11 June 1999.
Germinated seeds were counted and removed when samples were taken out of cold stratification
and after 7, 14, 21, and 28 d of incubation. Filter papers were remoistened as needed. Seeds were
considered germinated if the radicle was visible to the naked eye. Fungal contamination of petri
