2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Los Lunas Habitat Restoration Project
annual weeds so plants could be located for irrigation and evaluated. Unfortunately, there was no
control of annual weed emergence by the pendimethalin which had been previously sprayed. The
chemical was probably diluted past the state of effectiveness by the long standing surface water.
As of August 26, 2005, there has been no irrigation treatments applied to any of the plantings.
Subsurface moisture at this time was found to be approximately 18 inches below the surface.
The plantings were evaluated for survival August 22â€“23, 2005. Survival results for the
treatments of the parried plot trial were analyzed using the SAS Statistical analysis procedure
GLM (see Attachment A).
Results and Discussion
The construction of the silvery minnow egg retention ponds resulted in massive soil surface
disturbance. With the mixing of subsurface and surface soil, new weed seed was positioned on
the surface ready to germinate and establish with the addition of water. Because of the high flows
of the Rio Grande, water was ponded on the soil surface for more than 50 days (Figure 6). In
addition to providing anaerobic conditions for the planted shrubs and pole cuttings, a surplus
supply of water was available for weeds to germinate, establish and grow. Consequently, during
the entire period of this planting, the LLPMC has had to control weeds using both mechanical and
chemical treatments. Otherwise the planting easily could fail because of the blanket shading and
other impacts that would occur.

Leaving a 4- to 6- inch chip layer on the soil surface would have reduced the continued need for
weed control. A mulch layer similar to this was left where the mulch piles once stood and after
two years it is still controlling weed emergence (Figure 7). These sites are highly productive
because of the presence of surface water and need to be protected from annual and new perennial
weed emergence once they are disturbed.
