2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Los Lunas Habitat Restoration Project
Planting Preparation and Installation
The planting area consisted of two sites totaling approximately 16 acres and 1.2 miles in length
(Figure 1). There are approximately eight acres along the MRGCD drain ditch road and
approximately eight acres along the high-flow berm adjacent to the Rio Grande. The MRGCD
requested us to leave a 30-foot open area along the berm for access to the site.
