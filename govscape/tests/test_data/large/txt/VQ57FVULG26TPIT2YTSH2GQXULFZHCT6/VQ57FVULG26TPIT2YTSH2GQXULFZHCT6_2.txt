Abstract
This study evaluated root growth of Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa) and Saskatoon
serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia) on overburden at the Molycorp, Inc. Mine near Questa, NM.
Container grown, 1-year-old seedlings were transplanted, and either fertilized or not fertilized at
the time of planting in August 1995. Survival and shoot growth were monitored in 1996 and
2000. Root density was determined at three distances (planes) from the base of the plant at six
depths in 2000. Fertilization effects on serviceberry root densities were depth dependent. Total
root density of unfertilized plants was greater than fertilized plants. Serviceberry total root density
differed among planes (distances from base of plant) between fertilization treatments. Fertilized
plants had fewer roots in the 10-cm plane relative to the 20- and 30-cm planes. Fertilized plants of
Apache plume had higher total root densities at depths >20 cm within the 20-cm plane than plants
not fertilized at time of planting. Although overall performance in terms of shoot growth was
positive for both species, survival was generally low and root density varied when fertilized at
time of planting. Factors including fertilizer characteristics, planting date, and site conditions may
have influenced species performance.
