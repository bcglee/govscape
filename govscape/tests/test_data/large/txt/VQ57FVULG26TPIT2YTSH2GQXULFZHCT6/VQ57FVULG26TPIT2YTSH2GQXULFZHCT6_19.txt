Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
and mean calipers of 4.4 and 13 mm (0.17 and 0.51 in) were achieved after 1 and 2 growing
seasons for the 2001 (sown mid June) and 2002 (sown early May) seedling sources, respectively.
Salix scouleriana
Cuttings for S. scouleriana stock plants were collected from 1 male and 1 female plant at an
elevation of 2900 m (9570 ft) within the Carson National Forest in north-central New Mexico.
These cuttings produced seeds, and the resulting full sib seedlings are maintained in large pots as
seed sources. These 2-y-old seedling stock plants yielded seeds in early May and the resulting
seedlings, grown in SC-10s, had a mean height and caliper of 28 cm (11 in) and 3.5 mm (0.14 in),
respectively, after one growing season.
Salix exigua
Seeds of coyote willow (Salix exigua Nutt.) were collected in early June from an individual
female thicket in the Middle Rio Grande Valley. The mini-plug seedlings were transplanted into
SC-10 containers with either a moderate (3.5 kg/m3 [6 lb/yd3]) or high (7.1 kg/m3 [12 lb/yd3])
dose of incorporated CRF (3- to 4-mo release). Additional seedlings were transplanted at the
same time into D16 (262 ml [16 in3]) and D40 (656 ml [40 in3]) Deepotâ„¢ (Stuewe and Sons Inc)
containers containing the same soil-less mix with the high dose of CRF.
Relative to seedlings grown in SC-10 containers with moderate nutrient levels, mean height
growth was increased 29%, 46%, and 93% for the SC-10, D16, and D40 seedlings with high
nutrient levels. Similarly, increases in mean caliper of 15%, 51%, and 78% were noted for the
SC-10, D16, and D40 seedlings with high nutrient levels.
Salix arizonica Dorn
Arizona willow is classified as a sensitive species by the USDA Forest Service, as a highly
safeguarded species by the Arizona Native Plant Law, and has a global rank of rather rare (G3)
and state rank of rare (ARPC, undated). USDA Forest Service personnel collected seeds of S.
arizonica in early July 2002 from 2 previously identified female plants on the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forest. After 8 wk growth in SC-10s, the mean heights and calipers were 11 to 15 cm (4
to 6 in) and 2.2 to 2.3 mm (0.1 in), respectively.

Summary
The rapid growth rate of Salix seedlings and their almost immediate germination are appreciable
advantages for seed propagation. The small seed size and the potential difficulties in collecting
seeds from wild stands are among the problems that should be considered before initiating Salix
seedling propagation. The rapid transition from juvenile to reproductive phase for some willow
species offers benefits in establishing seed stock plants with considerable genetic diversity. Large
planting stock with enhanced probability of establishment in disturbed riparian areas can be
produced in 2 growing seasons.
