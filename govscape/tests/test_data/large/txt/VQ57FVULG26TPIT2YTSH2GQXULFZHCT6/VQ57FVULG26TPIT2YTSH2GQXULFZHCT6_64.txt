2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Los Lunas Habitat Restoration Project
August 2004
During the first week of August 2004, the prepared site was seeded by hand-broadcasting
the seed. The seed then was incorporated into the soil by harrowing with a farm tractor
which covered the seed with approximately Â¼-inch of soil.
The seed mix was composed of sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), Indian ricegrass
(Achnatherum hymenoides), alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), blue grama (Bouteloua
gracilis), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), and narrowleaf penstemon (Penstemon
angustifolius) (see Table 1).

September 2004, July and August 2005
The seeding was mowed with a brush hog once in September 2004, once in July 2005, and
once again in August 2005 to control annual weeds (Figures 3 and 4).
