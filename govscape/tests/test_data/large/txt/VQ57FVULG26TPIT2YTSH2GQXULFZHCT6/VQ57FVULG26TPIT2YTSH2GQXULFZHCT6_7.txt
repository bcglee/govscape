Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
Fertilization at time of planting
influenced Apache plume total
root density depending on depth
and plane (P = 0.0012; Figure 3).
In the 20-cm plane, total root
density of fertilized plants was
greater at depths below 20 cm
than all other treatments.

Survival and Shoot Growth
Survival of fertilized
serviceberry and Apache plume
plants was low the first year
after planting, although fertilized
plants that survived were larger
than control plants. Increased

others (1995) found NPK
fertilization treatments
improved shoot growth of white pine (Pinus strobiformis). Fertilizer applications on a
reclamation site in Idaho increased growth of both native and introduced plant species (Williams
and others 1990). Nitrogen and phosphorus applications greatly increased pine seedling height on
mine overburden in Alabama (Zarger and others 1973).
Low survival has been associated with the use of slow-release fertilizers in other studies. Fisher
and others (1983) observed slow-release fertilizer caused high mortality in juniper seedlings
(Juniperus monosperma). At an eastern Sierra Nevada surface mine, slow-release fertilizers
applied at doses of 30 g increased mortality of containerized, transplanted Jeffrey pine (Pinus
jeffreyi), whereas doses of 10 and 20 g did not affect mortality (Walker 1999b). Transplanting
date and release time of the fertilizer used in the study may have caused the observed mortality
during the first year for serviceberry. Fisher and others (1983) suggest transplanting and
fertilizing containerized tree seedlings during the summer rainfall period (July) in the Southwest
rather than in late summer and fall. Slow-release fertilizer applications in August were more
detrimental to juniper seedling growth and survival than May and July applications. It was
speculated that low night temperatures following recent nutrient additions resulted in frost
damage in August (Fisher and others 1983). Mortality of ponderosa pine seedlings in northern
Idaho was influenced by dose and rate of slow-release fertilizer, with high doses and 9- and 12-
month release times increasing mortality (Fan and others 2002).
Survival and shoot growth of transplanted and fertilized woody seedlings appear to be influenced
by many abiotic factors including planting date and the amount, formulation, and rate of release
of slow-release fertilizer. Based on published reports and our findings, transplanting Apache
plume and serviceberry earlier in the growing season, early to midsummer, with a concurrent
application of a slow-release fertilizer that releases nutrients when plants are actively growing,
may reduce mortality and promote shoot growth for both species.
