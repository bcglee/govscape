Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
naturally from root sprouts or buried branches and, as a result, adjacent plants on the project site
may be from the same done. Branches often break off parent plants during floods, become buried
farther downstream, and root into new plants. If few genetically different plants are growing in an
area to start with, perhaps the result of grazing, flood control, agricultural practices, or harvesting
(Karrenberg and others 2002), all the willows or cottonwood plants in a riparian community can
be from only a few parents or even a single parent. This was found to be the case with both
lanceleaf cottonwood (Populus x acuminata Rydb. pro sp.) and yellow willow (Salix lutea Nutt.)
on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona. Genetic testing revealed that all the plants at the
project site were dones of the same individual. This illustrates that natural asexual reproduction
tends to prevail in areas where secondary succession occurs. Along major rivers, however, where
periodic flooding occurs and wipes out the existing vegetation, primary succession prevails and
Salix and Populus populations are usually of seedling origin.
T'he unisex problem becomes even worse when willow and cottonwood cuttings are brought back
to the nursery and used to start stooling beds. Because cuttings will be collected from these beds
for many years, ignoring the sex of donor plants win seriously bias the sexual composition of the
cuttings. Walk through the stooling beds in your local nursery next spring when the willows are
flowering and you might be surprised.
In summary, if care is not taken to ensure that a balanced mix of male and female plants are used
for collecting cuttings, then the resultant plant materials will contain a disproportionate ratio of

males and females. When large numbers of these same plants are used in riparian restoration
projects, the long-term sustainability of the plant community will be jeopardized.
