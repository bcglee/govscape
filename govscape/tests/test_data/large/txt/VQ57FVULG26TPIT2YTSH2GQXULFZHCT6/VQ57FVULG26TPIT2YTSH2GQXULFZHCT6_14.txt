Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
Annual Collections from Wild Plants
The identification of female plants before cotton emergence can be determined by examination of
the individual flowers or maturing seed capsules on the catkins. The most critical factor in the
collection of viable Salix seeds is frequent observation of catkin development. For this reason,
establishment of stock plants in a nursery provides significant advantages over wild-land
collections. Catkin harvest is typically planned to coincide with the appearance of cotton
emerging from partially opened capsules (Schreiner 1974). I have harvested high percentages of
viable seeds if harvest is timed to coincide with this stage of capsule opening. It might be
preferable to wait until the capsules are almost
fully open, but spring winds can disperse seeds
very quickly once capsules reach this stage.
Female catkins are placed in paper sacks to
capture seeds as the capsules open during drying
(Figure 1). In a normal room environment, seeds
are released from the catkins in a few days. If
the number of catkins collected forms a layer 1
or 2 catkins thick in the sack, the seeds will
disperse easily without much oversight. If a
thick layer of catkins is placed in the sack,
occasional turning and stirring of catkins will be
required to facilitate uniform drying and seed
release. Avoid plastic bags as they cause
moisture buildup and subsequent decomposition.
Using Cuttings or Seeds to Establish
Seed Production Areas
If you desire to establish a seed orchard for
specific willow species and seed sources, you
can use either cuttings or seeds to start the
process. Generally, using cuttings already
having reproductive tissues speeds up the
process (Figure 2). The development of catkins
and flower pollination on recently stuck cuttings
can have variable results. With vigorous cuttings

production. However, less vigorous wild-
collected cuttings will often result in little if any
seed set during the first spring. Insects play a role in pollination of many willows so this fact
should be considered if cuttings are flowering in a greenhouse. For Salix cuttings, you must either
know the sex of the donor plants having observed catkins the year before, identified the sex by
microscopic observation of reproductive buds (see Landis and others 2003), or collected cuttings
from a large number of plants so it is likely that you have collected both sexes. I stick small
cuttings into 164 ml (10 in3) Ray Leach Super CelIs™ (SC-10) and larger cuttings into 2.8 l (1
gal) Treepots™ (1GTP) (both containers distributed by Stuewe & Sons Inc, Corvallis, Oregon). I

SC-10. I tag plants for gender, harvest and clean seeds, and sow seeds to produce initial
containerized seedlings. By summer, small stock plants from cuttings can be transplanted into
1GTPs (15 g 3 to 4 month CRF) and the larger stock plants can be planted into seed orchards.
