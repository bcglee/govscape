Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
Vegetative communities surrounding the mine consist of coniferous forests dominated by
ponderosa pine, mixed conifer (Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii] and limber pine [P. flexilis]),
and spruce-fir (Engelmann spruce [Picea engelmannii] and white fir [Abies concolor]) stands
(Harrington and Wagner 1994). Naturally formed alteration scars occurring in acidic (pH = 1.8 to
3.5) materials, occur at the mine and throughout the Red River Canyon (Meyer and Leonardson
1990; Steffan and Kirsten 1995). Plants from adjacent communities have established in the
periphery of these scars (Wagner and Harrington 1994).
Two planting sites (Blind Gulch and Spring Gulch) were located on terraced portions of
overburden piles at the molybdenum mine. Spring Gulch (2,780 m) is composed primarily of
neutral rock with an average pH of 7.7, electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.5 dS/m, and coarse
fragment fraction (content) of 69 percent. Blind Gulch (2,860 m) consists of both acidic and
neutral overburden materials. Chemical composition of the overburden across the planting area at
Blind Gulch was varied. Average values for pH, EC, and coarse fragment fraction (content) in
planting blocks one and two were 4.4 and 7.3, 1.2 and 1.3 dS/m, and 60 and 59 percent,
respectively.
Planting Stock
Seedlings of Apache plume (Questa, NM, seed source) and serviceberry (Utah seed source) were
propagated at the Natural Resources Conservation Service Plant Materials Center in Los Lunas,
NM. Seedlings were grown in 164-cm3 containers (Ray Leach Super Cells) in a peat:perlite
growing media (two parts peat moss and one part perlite by volume). Plants were fertilized with a
water soluble 20-10-20 fertilizer (Peter's Peat Lite Special).
Fertilization Treatments
Prior to transplanting, sites were ripped to a depth of 45 cm and irrigated. Ripping was
accomplished using three 65-cm ripping bars attached to the back of a crawler tractor. In August
1995, seedlings (approximately 10 to 20 cm tall) were transplanted into the two sites in a
randomized complete block design and irrigated the day after planting. Three blocks per site were
established and each block had two parallel rows, 50 cm apart. Within each row, plant spacing
was 30 cm. One row of each replicate block received fertilization treatment at the time of planting
and the other row did not receive fertilizer (control plots). Six grams of Sierra, Inc., 17-6-12 plus
micronutrients slow-release fertilizer (Scotts Company, Marysville, OH) were placed into each
planting hole prior to transplanting the seedlings. Release duration of this fertilizer is 3 to 4
months at 21Â° C. From 1996 through 2000 all plants received supplemental fertilization once each
year.
Survival and Shoot Growth
In September 1996 and August 2000 survival of both species was documented. In spring 2001,
shoot growth (height and crown width) was measured to the nearest centimeter for each plant. An
average crown width was calculated for each plant using two perpendicular measurements of
crown width oriented at 45 degrees to the direction of the planting row.
Root Measurements
In blocks one and two from each site, two plants per species per fertilization treatment were
measured for root growth and distribution. Roots were evaluated using techniques described by
Parsons and others (1998). Initial excavation in November 2000 was performed using a backhoe
to create a trench 1.5 m deep and 2 m long, 45 cm from the base of each shrub row. A 30 by 30
cm vertical plane was hand excavated 30 cm from the base of each plant where a 30 by 30 cm
sampling frame was placed for root evaluation. The frame was constructed out of clear Plexiglas
and divided by lines into 36, 5 by 5 cm grid cells. In each grid cell, roots were counted and
