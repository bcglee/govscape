To prepare the site for the containerized transplants, the soil surface of the planting area,
located between the access road along the high flow-berm and the bosque, was scraped
with the blade of a small dozer to remove the thick annual weed cover (mainly sunflowers
and kochia with some approaching 12-foot in height). The weeds were piled outside the
planting areas.
In mid-November, we planted 1,100 tall pots and 100 tree pots in the cleared areas:
• 700 New Mexico Olive (Forestiera neomexicana) tall pots
• 100 New Mexico olive tree pots
• 300 wolfberry (Lycium torreyii) tall pots
• 100 skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata) tall pots
The plants were planted to the depth of subsurface moisture, approximately 3- to 6-feet
(Figure 5). Paired plantings of 100 New Mexico olive tall pot and 100 New Mexico olive
tree pot transplants were planted within 8-feet from each other to test the effectiveness of
the pot size on plant survival. An irrigation tube measuring 40-inches long and 1-inch in
diameter was embedded with each transplant for future irrigation treatments. The lower ⅓
portion of the tube was perforated to enhance water dispersion in the root zone of each
plant.
