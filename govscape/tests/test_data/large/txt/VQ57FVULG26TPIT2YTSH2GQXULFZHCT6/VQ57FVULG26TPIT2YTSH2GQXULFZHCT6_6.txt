2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
influenced total root density of serviceberry (P < 0.010, Figure 22). Service- berry plants not
fertilized at time of planting had greater total root density in the 10-cm plane than fertilized
plants.
Apache Plume
Shoot growth of Apache plume
plants fertilized at time of
planting was greater than
unfertilized plants (height, P <
0.0001; crown width, P =
0.0022). Average height and
crown width of fertilized plants
were 42.4 and 43.2 cm, while
average height and crown width
of control plants were 21.3 and
29.0 cm, respectively. Survival
of Apache plume was influenced
by site and fertilization
