Sulfuric Acid Scarification Of Wax Currant Seeds From New Mexico
Introduction
Wax currant (Ribes cereum Dougl. [Grossulariaceae]) is a shrub species found throughout
western North America including New Mexico. Wax currant occurs on dry slopes, ridges, and
plains within numerous habitat types and plant communities (Vines 1960; Marshall and Winkler
1995). This species grows on diverse soil types and occurs across a range of temperatures and
precipitation levels (Marshall and Winkler 1995). Wax currant provides browse for deer when
better browse is not available, and fruits are eaten by numerous bird species (Marshall and
Winkler 1995). Wax currant is valued for use in the reclamation of disturbed lands.

The primary seed dormancy mechanism in Ribes species is embryo dormancy, but seed coat
dormancy controlled by growth inhibitors and/or an impermeable seed coat is suspected to occur
as well (Pfister 1974; Goodwin and Hummer 1993). Cold stratification for 60 to 300 d has been
used to overcome embryo dormancy for most Ribes species (Fivaz 1931; Quick 1936; Heit 1971,
Pfister 1974; Young and Young 1992; Goodwin and Hummer 1993). Among New Mexico
seedlots of wax currant, the cold stratification requirement ranges from 120 d or more for
northern seedlots, to none for at least one seedlot in the southern third of the state (Rosner and
others 2001). Others have also observed variability in seed dormancy level between and within
seedlots in Ribes (Pfister 1974; Young
and Young 1992).
Acid scarification using various
concentrations of sulfuric acid has
broken seed coat dormancy in some
Ribes species. A 5-min soak in 50%
sulfuric acid improved germination of
European black currant (Ribes nigrum
L.) (Adam and Wilson 1967).
Germination of Appalachian gooseberry
(Ribes rotundifolium Michx.) was
improved by a 35-min soak in
"commercial" sulfuric acid (Fivaz 1931).
Five-min soaks in 2% to 10% sulfuric
acid solution improved germination of
prickly currant (Ribes lacustre [Pers.]

viscosissimum Pursh) (Pfister 1974).
There is a lack of published literature documenting the use of acid scarification as a seed
treatment for wax currant.
