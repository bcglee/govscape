2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Field Maintenance at the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center
National Arboretum Americal Elm Selections
Study Number: NMPMC-F-0201-OT
Introduction
Two varieties of American elm were obtained from the National Arboretum in the spring of 2002.
The National Arboretum shipped three rooted plants of two varieties, Valley Forge and New
Hannony to the LLPMC for evaluation in our hardiness zone. On August 15, 2002, the six trees
were transplanted into Field 26S on the LLPMC.
The elm selections have a 100 % survival rate, and the amount of growth is fair but appears to be
limited by our climate. The New Hannony selection averaged 42 inches and the Valley Forge
plants averaged 75 inches in total height. Both elm selections had good foliage color, but very
few new branches were produced in 2004. It is too early in the growth of both selections to make
a judgment on how this species will perform here in Los Lunas.
The planting will be evaluated for growth and survival in 2005.
