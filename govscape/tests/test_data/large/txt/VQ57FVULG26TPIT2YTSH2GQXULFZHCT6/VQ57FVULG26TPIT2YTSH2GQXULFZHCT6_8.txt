Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
Root Growth
Fertilization treatment effects on
plant root density and distribution
vary in the literature. In this
study, there was no main effect of
fertilization on overall root
density for either species, but
fertilization at time of planting
did affect root distribution.
Studies have shown alteration in
plant root distribution in relation
to fertilizer applications. For
example, grasses increased their
root growth in response to
increased soil nutrients
(Eissenstat and Caldwell 1988).
Friend and others (1990) found
that Douglas-fir plants produced
more roots in nitrogen-rich than
in nitrogen-poor micro-
environments. In nitrogen
stressed environments, Douglas-
fir plants had a greater frequency
of roots within nitrogen rich
microenvironments than in
nonstressed environments (Friend
and others 1990). Similarly,
Ringwall and others (2000)
observed that fertilized leafy
spurge plants allocated a greater
portion of root biomass within
the first 10 cm of soil and
distributed a larger portion of
roots in fertilized areas of the
planting medium. It appears that
root system distribution can be
manipulated by fertilization at
time of planting, but responses
may be species dependent, as
seen in our study.

density of serviceberry at the base
of the plant relative to the
nonfertilized control. The rapid release of nutrients coupled with transplanting in late summer
when plants were still actively growing may have promoted shoot development at the expense of
root development into the overburden. As a consequence, plants receiving fertilizer at time of
planting may have had insufficient root systems to support their growth and survival during the
first year following plantings. Fertilization had an overall positive effect on total root density of
