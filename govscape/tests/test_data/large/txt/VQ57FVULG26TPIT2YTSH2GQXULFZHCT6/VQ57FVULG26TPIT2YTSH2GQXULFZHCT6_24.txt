Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
Table 1: A wide range of hardwood cuttings of willows and cottonwoods are used in riparian
restoration
Type of Cuttings Length (metric [English]) Use of cuttings
Microcuttings 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) Nursery propagation
Live stakes 30 to 45 cm (12 to 16 in) Direct sticking on site
Branched cuttings (whips) 0.6 to 1.8 m (2 to 6 ft) Bioengineering structures on site
Poles 3.6 to 4.9 m (12 to 16 ft) Outplanted on site
Solutions
Because sexual and genetic diversity are critical in ecological restoration, the sex of donor plants
should be identified in the field and sexual propagation should be used whenever possible.
Unfortunately, a biochemical or genetic test to distinguish the sex of a donor plant is unavailable
(Zasada and others 2003). Therefore, only field solutions are possible.
Identify the Sex of Parent Plants on Project Sites
By marking known clones of each sex in advance, cuttings or seeds of both sexes can be collected
(Figure 1). It is simplest to determine the sex of willow and cottonwood plants when they are
flowering. Depending on species, willow catkins may appear before (precocious), during
(coetanous), or after (scrotinous) new leaves appear in spring. This timing mechanism, along with
habitat and elevation, discourages hybridization between species-natural hybrids have only been
observed in small areas of overlap between closely related species that are usually separated by
elevational distributions (Argus 1964; Argus 1973; Dorri 1974; Brunsfeld and Johnson 1985).
Identifying anthers in male catkins (Figure 3A) and pistils in females (Figure 3B) is easy.
Verifying the sex of the parent plants is also easy when they are producing characteristic capsules
and cotton (Figure 3C).
During the winter dormant season, it is possible to identify the sex of dormant willows and
cottonwoods by examining the size and location of floral buds, which are typically found in the
upper branches just below the terminal vegetative bud. We have had good luck sexing
cottonwood trees in the field using a pole pruner to collect branch tips from upper portions of the
crown (Figure 4A), and examining the floral buds with a razor blade and 10X hand lens (Figure
4B). Male buds are typically larger than female buds and the floral structure can also be checked
by slicing buds with a razor blade (Figure 4C and 4D). Willows have much smaller buds,
however, and so it is better to examine the cut buds under a dissecting scope. Once an individual
plant is sexed, cuttings are collected, kept cool and moist in white plastic bags, and labeled. In
keeping with tradition, we use pink flagging labels for female cuttings and blue for males.
