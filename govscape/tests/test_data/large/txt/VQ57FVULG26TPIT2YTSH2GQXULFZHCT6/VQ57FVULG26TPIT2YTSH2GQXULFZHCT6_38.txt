Sulfuric Acid Scarification Of Wax Currant Seeds From New Mexico
dishes caused some problems. Seeds covered in mycelium, discolored, softened, or oozing were
removed from the petri dish and counted as rotten.
Categorical analysis (SAS PROC CATMOD) was used to determine treatment differences in total
germination using a factorial treatment structure (SAS Institute 1989; Stokes and others 1995).
Traditionally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to analyze germination data. The
ANOVA assumes continuous, normally distributed data with equal variances, but germination
percentage data has unequal variances between treatments and is frequently skewed and,
therefore, non-normal. Usually percentage data are arcsine transformed to achieve normality and
then analyzed by ANOVA. Categorical analysis eliminates the need for data to be transformed.
The procedure is a generalization of the chi-square (X2) test of homogeneity, using the "logit"-the
natural log of the ratio of germinated to non-germinated seeds-as the response (Grizzle and others
1969). Generalized least squares were used to calculate X2 test statistics. Observed significance
levels less than a=0.05 were considered significant. Percentages and standard errors were
calculated for main effects and interactions. Approximate pairwise Z statistics were used to
conduct pairwise comparisons of main treatment effects using a conservative alpha value of 0.05
divided by the number of comparisons. Due to a highly significant 3-factor interaction, main
effects and all 2-factor interactions except cold stratification by acid scarification are not
discussed here. This interaction is presented because growers will not be using the seedlots tested
in this study, and it may be useful to understand how cold stratification and acid scarification
interact averaged across multiple seedlots.
Results
Cold stratification, seedlot, acid scarification, and all interactions of these factors impacted
germination (Table 2). Germination response to combinations of cold stratification and acid
scarification treatments varied by seedlot (Figure 1). For all seedlots except the southernmost
(Gila) and the highest elevation Questa seedlot (Capulin), cold stratification was a more robust
treatment than acid scarification-the simple effect of cold stratification improved germination
more than the simple effect of acid scarification for those seedlots. For the Gila seedlot, however,
scarification improved germination more consistently than cold stratification, whereas for the
Capulin seedlot, which appeared to have the lowest overall quality, the combination of cold
stratification and acid scarification treatments resulted in threefold improvement in germination
over the best level of either treatment alone. Interestingly, the seedlot with the best cold
stratification-only germination (Raspberry Ridge) was most negatively affected by acid
scarification treatments, while the seedlot with the lowest cold stratification-only germination
(Capulin) was most positively affected.
The effect of scarification varied widely among cold stratification durations for all but the
Capulin seedlot, for which germination improved with increasing acid soak duration at all cold
stratification levels. For the remaining seedlots, acid scarification tended to improve germination
only at low, less effective levels of cold stratification. Averaged over all seedlots, 2- or 4-min
acid scarification treatments improved germination in combination with 0- or 60-day cold
stratification treatments, but all acid scarification durations reduced germination for seeds
undergoing 90 or 120 d of cold stratification (Figure 2). As a result of this interaction, for 3 of 6
seedlots (Raspberry Ridge, Pinon Knob, and Rociada), maximal germination could be achieved
without the use of acid scarification (Figure 1). For those 3 seedlots, no treatment combination
resulted in better germination than cold stratification for 120 d alone. For the remaining 3
seedlots, acid scarification was necessary to achieve maximal germination, but the optimal
treatment duration varied.
