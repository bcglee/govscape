Of the 300 wolfberry planted, 193 plants were located. Wolfberry tall pot transplants averaged a
51 percent survival. These plants were also impacted by inundation but not as severely as
skunkbush sumac.

after planting in August 2005.
Survival of the New Mexico olive tallpots (89 %) was significantly greater (.0001) than survival
of the treepots (14 %) in the paired plot trial (see Figure 15). The tree pot transplants broke
dormancy in May and dropped their leaves in June and then died while the soil was still
inundated. These plants have smaller root system (10–12 inches in length) compared to the root
system of plants grown in tallpots (25–27 inches in length). The larger root systems of plants
grown in tall pots may have allowed the plants to tolerate inundation for a longer period of time.
The buried stem of the tree pot plants would be less tolerant of inundation.

In addition, dense stands of salt cedar seedlings and salt cedar root sprouts are becoming
established on the planting areas along the high-flow berm. These stands of salt cedar need to be
controlled while they are small and can be killed easily by herbicide applications. If the salt cedar
stands are not controlled, they will be more competitive and reduce the density of the desired
vegetation.
