Prairie junegrass is a cool-season, perennial grass native to North America and temperate areas of
Europe. Its range extends across the western, central and northeastern United States. In New
Mexico, it occurs at elevations between 6,000 and 11,000 feet. It provides excellent forage for all
classes of livestock and wildlife. Populations of Prairie junegrass may be either diploid (2n=14)
or tetraploid (2n=28). Researchers have reported that ploidy level within a population will
increase with drought stress, and that tetraploid populations may reach anthesis as much as 21
days before their diploid counterpart.
Collections of Prairie junegrass were made from 98 locations throughout New Mexico. The
populations from New Mexico and two exotic populations were planted into non-replicated,
preliminary evaluation in 1984. These plots consisted of two rows of 14 plants. In 1989, three
early-flowering and three late-flowering accessions were visually selected from this evaluation.
The ploidy level of the selected accessions is unknown. The three early-maturing accessions
were collected from similar areas, suggesting they may have the same ploidy (Table 1). Two of
the late-maturing accessions are from Torrance County, NM suggesting that they may have the
same ploidy level.

In 1989, polycross blocks were established for the early-maturing and late-maturing accessions.
Plants for both types of polycross blocks were derived from the original collections.
In 1997, the polycross block for the late-maturing accessions did not perform as expected, and
was abandoned. In 1998, superior plants were selected from the early-maturing polycross block
established in 1989. Seed was collected from these plants, and clones were established from the
parents.
