Abstract
Due to the construction of silvery minnow egg retention ponds, the Los Lunas Plant Materials
Center (LLPMC) was contracted to restore 1.2 miles of the Rio Grande river bank in Los Lunas,
New Mexico. The LLPMC planted native vegetation on approximately 16 acres of a disturbed
area of the bosque. The LLPMC implemented planting techniques that involved getting the
plantsâ€™ roots or the cut end of the pole cuttings into the soil where subsurface water is naturally
present. This technique takes advantage of natural irrigation.
Currently, most of the plants are healthy even though they have not received any supplemental
irrigation. However, the plantings were inundated for 50 or more continuous days in May, June
and July 2005, killing many of the transplants and pole cuttings. The rate of survival was
affected by plant species and container type.
The plantings included four acres of grass and penstemon seeding, 1200 transplants of three shrub
species grown in tall pots, 100 New Mexico olive transplants grown in tree pots, 780
cottonwoods pole cuttings, and 865 black willow pole cuttings.
The survival rate of skunkbush sumac transplants grown in tall pots (8 %), New Mexico olive
transplants grown in tree pots (14 %), and newly planted cottonwood pole cuttings (27%) were
severely impacted by the 50 plus days of continuous inundation. The survival rate of transplants
of wolfberry grown in tall pots (50%) was also reduced by the inundation. The wolfberry plants
that were planted in low areas and were inundated for the longest period of time had typically
died. However, survival of second-year planting of cottonwood pole cuttings (76%) and New
Mexico olive grown in tall pots (93 %) was not affected by the 50 plus days of continuous
inundation. Survival of the newly planted black willow pole cuttings (67%) did not seem to
affected by inundation if they were planted in sandy top soils. When planted on sandy top soils,
nearly 100 % of the plants survived. On clay top soils, most had died.
Moist soil along riparian areas in the arid southwest is very conducive to growing vegetation,
including competitive weeds species. Once the soil of a riparian area is disturbed, it is common
for annual and perennial weeds to establish quickly. New plantings and seedings will find it
difficult to compete with fast-growing weeds for light, water, and nutrients. Applying a surface
layer 4-6 inches of wood chips will reduce weed emergence and allow desired plants to grow.
Surface mulch was not applied in this planting, and resulted in a continual application of weed
control methods to protect the desired plants.
Currently, the four-acre seeding on the high-flow berm has not become established. It is
competing with a dense population of annual weeds. The LLPMC will continue mowing this
seeding to reduce the weed competition.
In addition, dense stands of salt cedar seedlings and salt cedar root sprouts are becoming
established on the planting areas along the high-flow berm. These stands of salt cedar need to be
