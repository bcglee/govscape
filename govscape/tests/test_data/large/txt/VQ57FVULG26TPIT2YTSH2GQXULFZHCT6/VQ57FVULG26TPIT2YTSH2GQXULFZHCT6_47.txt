Study Number: NMPMC-P-8401-CP
Giant sacaton is a native, robust, perennial warm-season bunchgrass. It is found throughout the
southwestern United States, usually occurring on low alluvial flats and flood plains. It is useful
forage for livestock and wildlife. Under irrigation, Giant sacaton may reach heights exceeding 3
m. The mature plants range in height from 1â€“4 m. Based upon its density and height, it has the
potential as a windbreak plant for irrigated cropland.
Seed collections of Giant sacaton were taken from 37 locations throughout New Mexico. These
collections were used to establish non-replicated, accession rows that consisted of 520 plants in a
field at the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center. Based on a visual evaluation of vigor and height,
ten superior plants were selected. Each selected superior plant came from a separate accession to
maintain a diverse population. From these ten plants, one super selection was made. A hybrid,
cross-planting was established as an attempt to improve the height of the progeny.
In 1992, colonel shoots of each selected plant were planted into a hybrid, seed-production block
with the super plant as the male pollinator. In 1995, seed was hand-harvested from each female
parent. In 1996, this seed was used to establish an evaluation planting that contained both parents
and progeny. The progeny were derived from seed, and the parents were vegetatively propagated.
Both sets of plants were grown in 6-inch square pots for eight months in an attempt to equalize
carbohydrate reserves in the seed derived plants and the clones. The planting design was an
8-replicated, split-plot, randomized block design. Each replication consists of 20 plants spaced
on 10-ft. centers. A plot consists of a parent and the progeny plant.
The planting is mowed in the winter to remove plant liter from the previous year. By the end of
the third growing season, the leaf blades of most plants had approached 3 m in height. When the
plants are flowering they may approach 4 m.
In August 2002, the planting was evaluated for leaf height, basal width, and appearance. A
separate, paired, T-test statistical analysis was performed on each replication comparing the
height of each parent to its progeny. The progeny and parent plants were not significantly
different in height (alpha .05). However, there appears to be a difference in leaf blade width,
color, and uprightness between the parents and progeny plants. The cloned parent plants remain
identical to their source where the progeny plants seem to have random variation. The planting
will be evaluated again in 2005.
