Alkali Muhly
Study Number: NMPMC-P-8301-RA
Introduction
This accession of alkali muhly is in the process of being released as Westwater germplasm from
the LLPMC. Alkali muhly, sometimes known as scratchgrass, is a common riparian grass species
found throughout the U.S. except for the Southeast. Alkali muhly is a native, warm-season,
perennial sod grass, which has a prostrate or an erect growth form. Alkali muhly is an excellent
soil stabilizer because it is strongly rhizomatous and grows in moist-to-wet, sand-to-clay and
neutral-to-alkali soils.
Westwater germplasm alkali muhly was first collected in 1993 near Westwater Spring in San
Juan County located in northwestern New Mexico. This site is 5,200 feet in elevation, receives
about 7 inches of annual precipitation, and is in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6. The Westwater
germplasm release will be beneficial in the restoration of riparian sites along drainages located in
the LLPMC service area. Alkali muhly will be one of the plant materials used to control the
introduction or reintroduction of invasive species along riparian corridors.

Weed control was performed throughout the growing season to keep the field clean and promote
vigorous growth of the planting.
