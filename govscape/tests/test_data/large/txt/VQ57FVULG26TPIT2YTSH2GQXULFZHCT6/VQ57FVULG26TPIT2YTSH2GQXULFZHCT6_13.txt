Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
Introduction
The genetic and sexual diversity provided by seed propagation of Salix L. (Salicaceae) species is
an important consideration when planning riparian restoration projects. A standard seed
propagation protocol has been successful with a number of Salix species from montane habitats as
well as low elevation floodplains. Despite the very small seed size, most Salix are extremely rapid
growers, which helps negate some of the advantage typically attributed to cutting propagation.
Perhaps the largest hurdle to seedling propagation of Salix is the collection of seeds in the wild.
However, rapid development of nursery seed orchards is possible using reproductive cuttings
representing a mix of male and female plants or seedling stock which rapidly becomes
reproductive for many species.
Two principal differences between Salix and Populus L. (Salicaceae) influence seedling
propagation strategies if nursery seed stock plants are desired. The first relates to the location of
juvenile and mature wood in the 2 genera and where cuttings are usually taken. Often, Populus
cuttings are juvenile because they are taken from stems close to the root crown, not from mature
stems in the upper canopy. Therefore, cuttings are unlikely to have preformed floral buds that can
be forced in the current year. In contrast, Salix cuttings (particularly those from shrub-form
willows) are often taken from mature wood allowing same-year flowering of stock plants.
Secondly, the progression from juvenile to mature phase in Salix seedlings can be very rapid (2 to
3 y) especially when grown under near optimum conditions; such early maturing species include
Salix bebbiana Sarg., S. irrorata Andress., and S. scouleriana Barratt ex. Hook. Conversely,
Populus seedlings after more than 5 y of growth in the nursery have yet to become reproductive
even after attaining appreciable size.
Some of the willow propagation protocols that follow
address using reproductive phase cuttings to produce seed
stock plants, and probably would be effective for
reproductive phase Populus cuttings; this approach is
currently being investigated for Populus fremontii S.Wats.
Populus seed production from seed grown stock, however,
will likely be a very prolonged endeavor, as with most tree
species.
Obtaining Seeds
Two approaches can be used for collecting Salix seeds:

2. Bring back either cuttings or seeds to grow plants to establish a seed orchard for future
collections.
