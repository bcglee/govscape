2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Prairie Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha)
In 1999, an evaluation planting was established to compare the parents to the progeny. This
planting is replicated six times and is a latin square design. These accessions were visually
evaluated for forage and seed yield in 2003 and 2004. The progeny appear to be breeding true to
the parents for there was no visual difference. Subsequently the planting will be used for seed
production to support further field testing that will compare the performance of this material to
other available commercial sources. The range of adaptability of this germplasm will be
determined during field testing, and if it displays superior performance, the germplasm will be
released to the commercial seed industry.
2004 Treatment and Harvest
Field maintenance included the following:
• Weed control was performed throughout the growing season to keep the field clean and
promote vigorous growth of the planting.
• This planting was not evaluated in 2004. Evaluations will be completed in 2005 to work
towards a possible release of this species.
