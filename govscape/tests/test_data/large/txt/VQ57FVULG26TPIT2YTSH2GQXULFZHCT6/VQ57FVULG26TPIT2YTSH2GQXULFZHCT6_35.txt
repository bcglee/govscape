Abstract
The germination response of six New Mexico sources of wax currant (Ribes cereuum Dougi.
[Grossulariaceael) to combinations of 0 to 120 d cold stratification and 0 to 8 min of acid
scarification varied widely among seedlots. For most seedlots, cold stratification was more
effective than scarification in improving germination, and scarification improved germination
only at low, ineffective levels of cold stratification. For 3 of 6 seedlots, maximal germination was
achieved without scarification. For the remaining 3 seedlots, optional scarification duration
varied. Variability in sensitivity to acid scarification is discussed in terms of environmentally
induced effects on seed coat structure and physiology.
Key Words: cold stratification variability, dormancy
Nomenclature: IT IS (2001)
