2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Blunt Panic (Panicum obtusum)
Seed from the selected accessions was taken to the Tucson Plant Materials Center where the plant
breeder will continue the development of a commercial release with an improved seed
germination rate.
The original ¼-acre planting of the 80 accessions is still alive and growing vigorously. The ten
selections that were made were not randomly located throughout the planting as one would
expect. All but two accessions were located only on the outside rows of the planting. These
outside rows generally receive slightly more water due to a border affect, and this can
significantly improve seed fill and germination rate if plants are moisture stressed. Subsequently,
the planting has been heavily irrigated and fertilized in 2004 to encourage maximum seed
production. Seed will be bulk harvested and tested for germination rate. If seed fill and
germination rate is satisfactory (above 50%), the seed will be used to establish a new seed
production field. This is necessary because there is such a high, local demand for this commonly
occurring species. This seed will be provided to interested growers as a selected plant material
release.
If the seed germination rate is poor after bulking all the lots, we will increase the two accessions
through vegetative means that performed well in the interior of the planting. This seed will be
planted in a new, isolated planting and will be measured for seed fill and germination rate.
2004 Treatment and Harvest
Weed control was performed throughout the growing season to keep the fields clean and promote
vigorous growing of the planting.
