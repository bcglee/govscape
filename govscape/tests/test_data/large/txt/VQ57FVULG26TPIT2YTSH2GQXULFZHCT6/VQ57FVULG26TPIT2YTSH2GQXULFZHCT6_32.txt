Tumbling For Seed Cleaning And Conditioning
Introduction
At the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center in New Mexico, we use small, hobby-size rock tumblers
to accomplish a number of seed cleaning and seed conditioning treatments. The principal
application of the tumbler has been maceration of dried or hydrated fruit pulp. We commonly use
it to remove pulp from dried New Mexico olive (Forestiera pubescens Nutt. var. pubescens
[Oleaceae]) fruits. The fruits collected in late summer or fall after the pulp has dehydrate and
adheres tenaciously to seeds. A wet tumbling procedure employing pea gravel/crushed stone and
water in a rubber lined tumbler vessel allows the rehydration of the pulp an slow abrasion of pulp
from seeds. The amount of water is minimized so that the gravel and fruit makes a slurry. This
method is not quick, but the tumbler can be run overnight and check the following day. After a
course of tumbling, the contents dumped into a sieve and the pulp is washed off, leaving clean
seeds. The tumbling process is repeated until clean seeds achieved (Figure 1).
Another cleaning application involves removal
of fine hairs attached to achenes of Arizona
sycamore (Platanus wrightii S. Wats.
[Platanaceae]). The dry fruiting heads are
crushed under water to partially liberate the
achenes while preventing and fine hairs from
becoming airborne (Figure 2). A slurry achenes
with pea gravel is tumbled and the hairs detach
time and can be separated using sieves and
strong sprays of water. In addition, the wet
tumbling thoroughly imbibes seeds and may
leach out water soluble germination inhibitors.
After cleaning and imbibition, seeds are
typically cold stratified.
Dry tumbling to scarify legume seeds has been
investigated, (Bonner and others 1974; Dreesen
and Harrington 1997). The rationale for dry

treatments. Dry tumbling is a slow process
taking several days to a week, but we often use it when we have small seed lots we do not want to
risk with other scarification treatments. The procedure uses carborundum grit (sold by rock
tumbler dealers), pea gravel, and seeds. After tumbling, scarified seeds are separated from the grit
and gravel with sieves. The grit can also be reused by washing the seed coat debris through a fine
sieve or by floating off the debris and then drying the grit. Different size grits are available and
we typically use fairly coarse material. Coarse grit size is still much smaller than most legume
seeds, allowing the easy sieve separation of grit, seeds, and gravel.
