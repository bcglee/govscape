2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Root Growth of Apache Plume and Serviceberry on Molybdenum Mine Overburden in Northern New Mexico
divided into three diameter classes: <0.5, 0.5 to 2.0, and >2.0 mm. Root measurements were
repeated at 20 and 10 cm from the base of each plant within the same vertical sampling frame.
Data Analysis
The experimental design was a completely randomized design set in a split-split plot. Whole plot
treatment was site and block within site was the whole plot error term. The split factor was
fertilization treatment and the split- split factors were plane and depth. 'Plane" refers to the
horizontal distance away from the plant perpendicular to the row (10, 20, or 30 cm).
Survival of each species in 1996 and 2000 was analyzed through Chi-square tests in SAS using
PROC FREQ (SAS Institute 1997). Shoot growth (height and crown width) was analyzed for
each species using analysis of variance in SAS (PROC GLM) to indicate simple and interaction
effects of site and treatment.
Root counts were analyzed separately for each species using analysis of variance in a 2 (site) x 2
(fertilization treatment) x 3 (plane) x 6 (depth) factorial (PROC MIXED, SAS Institute 1997).
Roots from three categories were combined for a weighted total to obtain a total root density
(number of roots per 150 cm 2). Roots 0 to 0.05 mm were assigned a midpoint value of 0.025,
roots 0.05 to 2.00 mm were assigned a midpoint value of 1.25, and roots greater than 2.00 mm
were assigned a midpoint value of 2.25.
For root response, PROC MIXED calculated F statistics, means, and standard errors of both main
effects and interaction combinations. Main effects of plane and depth and their interactions with
fertilization treatments were evaluated, and least significant differences (LSD) were carried out
for pairwise comparisons of main effects of plane and depth on root growth. All treatment effects
for survival, and shoot and root growth were evaluated for significance at the 0.05 alpha level.
Results
Saskatoon Serviceberry
Fertilization at time of planting increased serviceberry crown width relative to unfertilized control
plants (p = 0.0015). Crown widths of fertilized and control plants were 31.2 and 19.0 cm,
respectively. However, fertilization at time of planting reduced survival of serviceberry,
compared to controls, at both planting sites in 1996 (P = 0.0006) and 2000 (p = 0.0002). Survival
of nonfertilized control plants was highest at the Spring Gulch site (Table 1).

Fertilization at time of planting influenced total root density of serviceberry depending on
sampling depth (P < 0.0001; Figure 1). Fertilized plants had lower total root densities at 5- to 10-
and 10- to 15-cm depths than control plants. Across horizontal planes, fertilization treatments
