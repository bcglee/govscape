Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
By: Thomas D Landis2, David R Dreesen3, and R Kasten Dumroese4
Study Number: NMPMC-T-0501-OT
Abstract
Most restoration projects strive to create a sustainable plant community but exclusive use of
vegetatively propagated material may be preventing this goal. The dioecious willows and
cottonwoods of the Salicaceae are widely used in riparian restoration projects. Hardwood cuttings
have traditionally been used to propagate these species in nurseries, and live stakes, branched
cuttings, and poles are also used in bioengineering structures for bank stabilization. Woody
cuttings are collected either from the project site or from stooling beds in nurseries during the
winter dormant period. Unfortunately, little attention has been given to the sex of the donor
plants. The potential problem is that a proper mixture of male and female plants may not be
present in the hardwood cuttings or rooted cuttings destined for the restoration siteâ€“in the worst
case they may be entirely 1 sex or the other. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to distinguish male
and female plants. Collecting cuttings from many different plants and from a known ratio of
males and females will ensure that the resultant plants will be able to produce viable seeds and
achieve the ultimate goal of a sustainable plant community.
