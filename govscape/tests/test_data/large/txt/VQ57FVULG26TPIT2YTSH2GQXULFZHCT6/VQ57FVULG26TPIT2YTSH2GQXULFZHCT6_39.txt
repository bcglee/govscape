The percentage of seeds rotting during the course of cold stratification and germination testing
(based on the total number of seeds) increased sharply with increasing duration of acid soak, for
both pooled seedlots and by seedlot (Figure 3). The differences among seedlots in percentage of
rotting seeds corresponded to differences in acid scarification treatment efficacy. The 2 seedlots
with the highest percentages of rotting seeds at all treatment levels (Raspberry Ridge and Pinon
Knob) were 2 of the 3 seedlots that did not benefit from acid scarification. In contrast, 3 of the 4
seedlots with the lowest percentages of rotting seeds (Capulin, Mahogany Hill, and Gila) had
optimal treatment combinations involving some level of acid scarification. It should be noted that
seeds must be filled in order to rot, but seed fill was not measured. The percentage of filled seeds
may have varied among seedlots, and some of the observed differences in rotting may have been
influenced by differences in seed fill.
Discussion
Variability in acid scarification requirement among seedlots has been found to occur in numerous
species including California redbud (Cercis canadensis var. texensis [S. Wats.] M. Hopkins
[Fabaceae]) (Heit 1967), honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos L. [Fabaceae]) (Bonner and others
1974), and cotoneaster species (Cotoneaster Medilc [Rosaceae]) (Slabaugh 1974). This
variability occurs to such an extent that Heit (1967) and Bonner (2001) recommend testing each
seedlot of species requiring acid scarification to determine the optimum duration of treatment.
Seed source has been ascribed as a major source of this variability (Heit 1967; Bonner 2001). A
good example of source variability is Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus [L.] K. Koch
[Fabaceae]), where acid scarification improved germination of seeds collected in Ohio and
Illinois, but not in Minnesota (Frett and Dirr 1979; Ball and Kisor 1985). For wax currant in the
present study, the effect of sulfuric acid scarification on germination varied widely among
seedlots, but this variability conformed to no latitudinal or elevational pattern. In fact, Capulin
and Raspberry Ridge seedlots occur at similar elevations within a mile of each other, yet response
to acid scarification was nearly opposite; increasing acid soak duration increased Capulin
germination, whereas all levels of acid soak, when combined with cold stratification, reduced
Raspberry Ridge germination.
This differential response to acid scarification among proximal seed sources may stem both from
genetic and environmental differences between these populations. The extent of the contribution
of each factor, however, is generally difficult to determine (Anderson and Milberg 1998).
Environmental factors during seed maturation have been shown to affect depth of dormancy
(Gutterman 1992), seed coat thickness (Pourrat and Jacques 1975), seed coat permeability
(Gutterman and Evanari 1972), seed coat thickness and germination-inhibiting polyphenol
