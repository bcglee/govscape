Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
species has been harvested during propagule collection. Otherwise, vegetative characteristics may
be the only key to separating species until catkins develop.
Standard Container Seedling Production Protocol
The most common container stock type we use for montane riparian restoration is 1GTP
containers. This container size is generally adequate for acceptable rates of survival with little
aftercare, except protection from cattle and elk. In lower elevation cottonwood forests, 1GTP
stock can be used but typically requires supplemental watering for several years to become
established. We use small volume "mini-plugs" to maximize greenhouse space for starting the
crop, transplant up to SC-10 containers, and finish the crop cycle in 1GTP containers.
Seed Cleaning
Once seeds are harvested from wild stands or on-site seed Orchards, they can be cleaned using an
air stream and soil screens similar to that described for Populus by Schreiner (1974). A
compressed air source and a set of 3 soil screens in a series from top to bottom of 250 gm (# 60),
500 gm (# 35),125 gm (# 120) are employed; the dry catkins containing open capsules are placed
between the 250 gm and 500 gm screens (Figure 3). A jet of compressed air is blown through the
top screen in a swirling fashion; the seed is dislodged and sifts through to the 125 µm screen. The
cotton and empty catkins remain on the 500 µm screen. Seeds can also be cleaned with vacuum
systems (see Dawes 2003; Day and others 2003).
Seed Germination
At the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center in New Mexico, we germinate willow seeds within a few
days of cleaning in "mini-plug" containers having 512 cavities each 14 x 14 x 29 mm (0.5 x 0.5 x
1.1 in [for short term growth–2 to 3 wk]) or 341 cavities each 19 x 19 x 63 mm (0.75 x 0.75 x 2.5
in [for longer term growth–4 to 6 wk]). We rely on mini-plugs because of space restrictions on
our automated watering bench that precludes large-scale germination in larger containers. The
germination medium is a standard sphagnum peat moss and perlite mix of fairly coarse texture.
The coarse texture allows the small Salix seeds to infiltrate between the particles of peat moss,
allowing optimum aeration, moisture, and light.
One difficult task is hand seeding. Precision is very difficult because willow seeds are very small
(the largest being about 1 mm in length and 0.3 to 0.5 mm in width). Adding a diluent of similar
size might be of some benefit in achieving more precise sowing by hand. The seeds are usually
sufficiently clean that an automated seeder typically used for bedding plant seeds of similar shape
and size would probably be effective if very large-scale seeding was envisioned.
Mini-plug Irrigation
The plug medium surface must be kept continuously moist; germination of willow seeds is often
apparent after 1 d as noted by the swelling and separation of the cotyledons. Our greenhouse
watering bench has mini-sprinklers and automatically waters plug trays once a day (Figure 4).
The bench is covered with a copper-coated fabric (Texel Tex-R® Forestry Fabric, Texel Inc,
Quebec, Canada) to reduce root egress from the plug cells; this fabric covers a filter fabric
(Dewitt soil separator fabric) which acts to pull excess water out of plug cells via capillary water
movement. Soluble fertilizer is applied once or twice a week at a rate of 200 mg/l (ppm) nitrogen
(20N:OP O :20K O Peat Lite Special; Peters Professional, Scott's Company, Marysville, Ohio).

Ideally, the plugs are transplanted as soon as the root sys- tem is sufficient to keep the soil plug
intact (3 to 6 wk depending on species and plug size).
