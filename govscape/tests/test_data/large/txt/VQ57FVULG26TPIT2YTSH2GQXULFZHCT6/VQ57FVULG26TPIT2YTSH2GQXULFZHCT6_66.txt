February 2005 The area between the MRGCD road on the west side of the river, and the
bosque north of the pond access was mowed in preparation for the March
2005 planting of cottonwood pole cuttings.
March 2005
In early March, the area was planted with 300 cottonwood pole cuttings. The cuttings were
planted on approximately 30–40 foot centers. Each pole had a poultry wire tree guard
installed using the same methodology as previously discussed.
April 2005
Location: East side of the high-flow berm
To reduce stream flow velocity protecting the berm, we planted 845 western black willow
and 1,425 coyote willow. So that the new planting would not have to be irrigated, both
species were planted in 8-foot augured holes that reach subsurface moisture. The coyote
willows were planted in group of four willows per hole, about 10 feet from the berm; no
tree guards were installed. The western black willows were planted individually along the
toe of the berm with tree guards. The areas that had been previously planted with tall pot
containerized shrubs were sparsely planted with 110 cottonwood pole cuttings with tree
guards to provide an overstory structural component.
Planting Maintenance
The areas planted in tall pot transplants and cottonwood pole cuttings near the river along the
west side of the high-flow berm were spot treated once in April with a mixture containing a post-
emergent and pre-emergent herbicide which were respectively 2% glyphosate (Roundup at 47.6
%) and 2% pendimethalin (Pendulum at 37.4 %).
In May 2005, only the post-emergent herbicide was applied. In both April and May, glyphosate
(‘Pondmaster’) was applied around the edge of the pond to control mainly sunflower and kochia.
By mid-May most of the treated areas were under water due to the rise in groundwater; a
consequence of the extremely high flow of the Rio Grande. This high flow of water was due to
twice the normal amount of snow-pack in the watershed compounded by extremely warm air
temperatures. This area remained under water until mid-July.
When the soil surface dried out enough for a vehicle to enter the site (late July 2005), the
perimeters of the tall pot transplants were sprayed with glyphosate (Roundup at 47.6%) to control
