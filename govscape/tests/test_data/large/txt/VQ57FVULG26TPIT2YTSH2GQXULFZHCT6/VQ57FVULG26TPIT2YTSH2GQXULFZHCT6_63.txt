2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Los Lunas Habitat Restoration Project
April 2004
Location: North of the river access road between the existing bosque and the MRGCD
drain ditch road.
The LLPMC staff planted 580 cottonwood (Populus deltoides) pole cuttings and 20
western black willow (Salix gooddingii) pole cuttings. The original source of the poles was
taken from the Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge, but the poles that were cut and planted
were grown and harvested from production fields at the LLPMC. We prepared the poles
by pruning all but two or three terminal branches. The cut poles were then kept hydrated by
placing their cut ends in water tanks until they could be planted.
The planting holes were dug using a 65-hp farm tractor with a front-end mounted auger
that was 9-inches in diameter and 8-foot in length (see Figure 2). We planted the poles on
15–30 foot centers. After planting the poles we placed a poultry-wire tree guard (5-foot in
height and 10-inches in diameter) around each pole to control beaver predation.
May 2004
By May of 2004, several mature
cottonwoods had fallen over the access road
that parallels the high-flow berm. The
LLPMC staff used chain saws to cut up the
debris, and then removed it from the
planting site.

May, June, July 2004
Location: 1.2 mile high-flow berm along the river and the access road parallel to the high-
flow berm (see map).
To prepare for the seeding, we sprayed this area once in May, once in June, and once in
July with the herbicide glyphosate (‘Rodeo’) at the rate of 1-gallon per acre to control
common annual weeds. The site was kept fairly clean with this treatment. To apply the
herbicide, we used a 50-hp farm tractor outfitted with a power take off (PTO), 10 ft. boom
spray system. The entire seeding area is approximately 4 acres in size.
Because the access road had been driven over regularly by vehicles resulting in compacted
soil, we disked the access road that had been sprayed prior to the seeding.
