Propagation Protocol For Container Willows In The Southwestern US Using Seeds
Transplanting into SC-10 Containers
Our medium is a mix of 2 parts Sun- shine Mix#l or#2 (Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue,
Washington) with 1 part perlite (v:v) that has 2.7 kg (6 lb) of CRF incorporated per 0.765 nl3 (1
yd3) of medium. For plants started in the greenhouse during spring, 5- to 6-month release CRF is
used, but for summer grown material 3- to 4- month release CRF is incorporated.
Filled SC-1O containers are dibbled to provide a hole for the mini-plug seedling. Thinning
seedlings is often required and can be completed as the mini-plugs are transplanted into the SC-
10 containers if seedlings are large enough to make clipping feasible. Otherwise, thinning is ac-
complished after some growth has occurred in the SC-10 containers. The mini-plug seedling root
ball is removed using a flat powder spatula having a blade about 6 mm (0.25 in) wide and 30 mm
(1.2 in) long attached to a handle. The blade is plunged along the side of root ball and the
seedling plug is levered out of the cell. The plug is dropped into the dibbled hole and the medium
is pressed around the root ball with fingers. Top watering firms and fills any voids around the
plug.

Transplanting into Treepotsâ„¢
Transplanting into 1GTPs usually occurs in the late summer of the first year or spring of the
second year. The containers are filled with an aged bark:pumice:peat medium (55:35:10; v:v:v)
and dibbled with a SC-10-size planting dibble. CRF is top-dressed at planting or soon thereafter.
For pots transplanted in late spring, a 5- to 6- month release CRF is used at a rate of 15 g (0.5 oz)
per pot. Seedlings transplanted later in the summer receive a similar rate of 3- to 4-month release
CRF. While the plants are establishing themselves in the larger container, irrigation is usually ap-
plied 3 times per week. Plants are typically grown without shade. Watering frequency during the
rapid growth phase is every day for large riparian plants with substantial leaf areas.
