Blue Grama (Bouteloua gracilis) Variety Trial
Blue Grama Variety Trial

Study Number: NMPMC-T-0401-RA
High-elevation grazing competition between elk and livestock has become a concern for
landowner Carl Smith. Elk have been grazing on his forage pasture during the spring, decreasing
the available forage for livestock during the summer-grazing season. The elk herd in the area eats
the cool-season grass forage prior to the introduction of livestock in the summer months. Without
the cool-season species forage, and because of the low production rate of warm-season,
indigenous forage grass species, the livestock end up with an insufficient amount of feed during
the summer grazing period.
To attempt to solve this problem, the NRCS Field Office in Espanola, New Mexico and the Los
Lunas Plant Materials Center (LLPMC) are establishing a trial planting of improved varieties of
blue grama. Blue grama is a component of the warm-season range species indigenous to the
ranch. The native blue grama exhibits low forage production and does not contribute much to the
total forage production of this rangeland. Improved varieties of blue grama could provide a
greater forage potential at this elevation (8200 feet).
On July 27, 2004, the LLPMC installed four varieties of blue grama on Mr. Smithâ€™s ranch:
Hachita, Lovington, Alma and Bad River Ecotype. Hachita, Alma and Lovington are improved
blue grama varieties developed by the LLPMC. Bad River Ecotype is an ecotype release from the
Bismarck Plant Materials Center (PMC) in North Dakota. Including the Bad River Ecotype in the
trial planting allows the opportunity to evaluate an accession from a northern climate. The new
trial planting covers .10 acres in 16 replicated plots. The seed was installed using a plot drill.
The seeding was evaluated on 10/01/2004. None of the blue grama seed had germinated. The July
2004 planting may have been too late in the season for germination to occur at this elevation. In
2005, a new trial planting of the same four varieties will be installed but at an earlier date.
Another evaluation of the 2004 planting is scheduled for 2005.
