Sulfuric Acid Scarification Of Wax Currant Seeds From New Mexico
Seeds damaged or weakened by excessive
treatment lose their ability to resist pathogenic
deterioration (Murdock and Ellis 1992). For
the Raspberry Ridge seedlot, a high
percentage of seeds rotted following even the
shortest duration of acid soak, indicating that
sulfuric acid damaged seeds at all treatment
levels. Although the Capulin seedlot
responded positively to acid scarification, 10%
to 20% of scarified seeds rotted following
treatment, depending on treatment level. This
occurrence indicates a high degree of within-
seedlot variability in seed coat dormancy and

damaging to other seeds within the lot (Young and others 1984). In some cases, weaker solutions
and longer incubation durations may reduce the risk of damaging seeds without loss of treatment
efficacy (Young and others 1984).
Conclusions
Our results suggest germination in New Mexico seedlots of wax currant is improved by 120 d of
cold stratification, but response to acid scarification is variable. For most seedlots, cold
stratification for 120 d results in good germination. Further increases in germination can be
realized through the use of treatments targeting seed coat dormancy mechanisms, but sulfuric acid
may be too reactive to be an effective agent. Better understanding of the mechanisms imposing
seed coat dormancy in this species may lead to the development of more effective seed
treatments.
