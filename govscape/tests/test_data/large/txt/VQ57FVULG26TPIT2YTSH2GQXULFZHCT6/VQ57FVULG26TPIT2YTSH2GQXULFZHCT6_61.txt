2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Los Lunas Habitat Restoration Project
controlled while they are small and can be killed easily by herbicide applications. If the salt cedar
stands are not controlled, they will be more competitive and reduce the density of the desired
vegetation.
Introduction
The USDA-NRCS Los Lunas Plant Materials Center (LLPMC) participated in an interagency
project designed to restore the hydrology of an area of the Rio Grande in Los Lunas to its natural
condition where spring overbank flooding occurs. In an effort to protect the survival of the
Silvery Minnow, egg retention ponds were constructed inside a 1.2 mile high flow channel on the
river. In the process of building these structures, some of the native and non-native vegetation had
to be cleared away. To restore this area to its natural vegetative state, the LLPMC implemented
some unique planting methods which will require little or no irrigation. These planting methods
were either developed or refined by the LLPMC, and they were used on this project to measure
their effectiveness.
Developing a successful transplanting system that requires minimal follow-up irrigation is critical
for bosque restoration in the droughty Southwest. These areas receive less than 10 inches of
annual precipitation. The selection of tall pots (containers 30-inches in length and 4-inches in
diameter) coupled with embedded irrigation tubes (40-inches in length and 1-inch in diameter)
were tested at this site. Pole cuttings of cotton woods and western black willows were also tested.
Both planting systems rely on getting roots or pole cuttings into the soil where subsurface water is
present to provide the irrigation needs for the plants.
The participants in this project consisted of the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center (LLPMC), the
Albuquerque District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Albuquerque office of the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and the Middle Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD).
Background
In the area of the minnow ponds, the cottonwood gallery was destroyed in a wildfire in the spring
of 2000. The scorched, 50-foot mature cottonwood trees appeared to be dead, but by late summer
of 2000 they were starting to re-sprout at their base. In order to start the construction of the egg
retention ponds in 2002, all of the wood debris had to be removed.
At the request of the LLPMC, the fine branches of the cottonwoods and small trees were chipped
and transported to an off-site location. Traditionally the wood chips are used as a mulching layer
and spread on the planting site, but the LLPMC thought it would be easier to establish
cottonwood pole cuttings, shrub transplants, and grass seedings if the mineral soil was exposed
and not covered by a layer of mulch. This would prove to be a costly mistake because of the
prolific weed emergence as described in the results section of this document. The larger material,
such as the main stems of the mature trees, were also removed and transported to an off-site
location. Some standing dead trees were left intact to provide for woodpecker and raptor habitat.
