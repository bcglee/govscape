Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
Figure 5: Seedlings of willow and cottonwood can be produced in 3 to 4 y, depending on how soon seed can be produced and
the desired stock size.
Summary
The dioecious nature of the Salicaceac requires that special measures must be taken to ensure that
genetic and sexual diversity is maintained during propagation. The critical thing is to identify the
sex of willows and cottonwoods when collecting cuttings in the field. Then, a sexually and
genetically diverse mixture of cuttings can be obtained for bioengineering structures, direct
sticking, or for establishing stooling beds in the nursery. Seed propagation should be encouraged
whenever possible. Seeds can be collected from the project site, or it is relatively easy to force
seed production from rooted cuttings in the nursery. Using these procedures, one can collect
cuttings, force seeds, and grow genetically and sexually diverse willow and cottonwood seedlings
in as little as 3 to 4 y.
