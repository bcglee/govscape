Introduction
Five culms from six accessions, 9009424, 9009413, 9009414, 9009419, 9009418 and 9009420
were taken from plants in the initial evaluation planting in Field 6 of the LLPMC on 4/13/2004.
The culms were placed in one gallon pots and put in the LLPMC greenhouse. On 10/20/2004, the
one-gallon transplants were planted into Field 7. In 2005, five more culms of the six superior
accessions will be dug from the IEP in Field 6 and placed in pots to provide 10 plants per
accession in the advanced planting of tobosa in Field 7. This advanced planting then will be
evaluated to determine if a plant materials release of tobosa can be justified.
Evaluation of the accessions will continue in 2005 for possible release.
2004 Treatment and Harvest
Weed control was performed throughout the growing season to keep the field clean and promote
vigorous growth of the planting.
