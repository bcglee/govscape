Tumbling For Seed Cleaning And Conditioning
Wet tumbling can be used for
scarification if an abrasive (typically pea
gravel) is incorporated in the seed and
water slurry (Dreesen and others 2002).
The force imparted to the grit by the
tumbling gravel facilitates abrasion.
Although this treatment method may
result in some seed coat degradation,
other effects may be more important,
such as assuring com- plete imbibition in
well-aerated water and the leaching of
water soluble germination inhibitors in
the seed coat. A typical treatment would
involve wet tumbling for several days

[Grossulariaceael]) and wolfberry
(Lycium torreyii Gray [Solanaceae]) generally require 2 to 3 m of cold stratification to achieve
acceptable germination. Wet tumbling followed by 1 to 2 wk of storage in a warm moist
environment has resulted in germination without cold stratification. The dry seeds of another
important riparian species, redosier dogwood (Cornus sericea L. ssp. sericea [Cornaceae]),
generally require 1 h scarification in concentrated sulfuric acid and then 2 to 3 mo of cold
stratification for acceptable germination. Using fresh fruit with hydrated pulp, rapid germination
has been achieved by wet tumbling the fruit with 1 to 2 cm (0.5 to 0.75 in) gravel. Most of the
pulp is removed in the first day of tumbling and separated by screening and float/sink
manipulations in water. After pulp removal, seeds are wet tumbled for several more days with
daily water changes. The imbibed seed is then stored in a warm moist environment; germination
starts in about 7 to 10 d and continues for several weeks. Although a limited number of species
have been tested with wet tumbling for seed conditioning, additional species may benefit from
this treatment.
