Figure 9: Cottowoods poles cuttings in their second year planted along
the MRGCD drain ditch road in August 2005.
However, of the 410 cottonwood pole cuttings planted in March and April 2005, the survival rate
averaged only 27 percent. The trees were affected by the 50 day plus inundation which occurred
from May to July of 2005. The pole cuttings leafed out in May as they typically do, but they
began to show signs of chlorosis by mid-June, and by July (Figure 10) they had dropped their
leaves. Those plants that did survive were located on slightly higher ground within the planting.
Similar survival results occurred on a new planting of cottonwood poles about 15 miles south of
this planting. This similar planting was also inundated, and most of these pole cuttings also died
except for those that were planted on higher ground.
Figure 10: In July 2005 three months after planting, these cottonwood pole
cuttings had dropped their leaves and are probably dead.
Survival of the western black willow planted on the toe of the berm averaged 53 percent as a
consequence of inundation (Figure 11). Those planted in sandy top soil seemed to have a higher
survival rate (Figure 12). Their were areas within the planting that had 30 or more consecutive
dead willows that seemed to correlate to clay soil surface texture which may provide less air for
root respiration under saturated conditions. Traditionally, survival averages above 70 percent
when conditions are ideal and the plants are not inundated. Survival of the coyote willow
averaged about 75 percent even though they were planted in a slightly lower area than the western
black willow (Figure 13). They appear to display a better tolerance to inundation than the western
black willow. Some of the coyote willows were damaged by beaver. However the stems that
were cut all had new growth. The western black willows with the beaver guards were left intact.
