Sex and the Single Salix: Considerations for Riparian Restoration
Figure 4: Dormant cottonwood trees can be ‘sexed’ by clipping branches from the upper crown with pole pruners (A)
bisecting the floral buds and examining them with a hand lens. Floral buds are always located laterally on the stem
below a terminal vegetative bud (B), and with a few supplies, can be easily sampled and identified. Female buds are
smaller and the round pistils can be clearly seen (C), whereas male buds are larger and distinguished by the presence of
the pollen sacs (D).
