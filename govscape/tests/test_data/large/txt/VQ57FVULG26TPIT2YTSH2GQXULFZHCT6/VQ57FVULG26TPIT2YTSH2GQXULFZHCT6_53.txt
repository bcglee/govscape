2004 LLPMC Annual Technical Report
Evaluation of Giant Sacation For Use In Field Windstrip Plantings
Schwebach Farm
This giant sacaton windstrip planting is located in McIntosh, New Mexico. The planting was
installed in August of 2004 using transplants grown at the LLPMC. The windstrip was installed
along the west side of a farm road adjacent to irrigated cropland. The planting will protect
cropland from wind erosion during the windy season (February–May). The planting will be
irrigated using water from an existing underground irrigation pipeline. Plants were planted in two
staggered rows and spaced 6-feet apart. At the October 2004 evaluation, the plants had averaged
10 inches in height and 6 inches in width. The current survival rate is 100 percent. The plants
appear to be healthy and vigorous, and they have received abundant moisture due to heavy rains
in the area. This planting will help us to evaluate the suitability for this species to be used as a
windstrip in this part of New Mexico.
An evaluation is scheduled for 2005.
Turner Ranch
This giant sacaton windstrip planting is located on the Turner ranch approximately 15 miles
northwest of Deming, New Mexico. The planting was installed in July 2002 using transplants
grown at the LLPMC. The windstrip is adjacent to irrigated cropland and will provide wind
erosion protection for the cropland during the windy season (February–May). This planting will
provide evaluation data on the suitability of giant sacaton as a windstrip species in this part of
New Mexico. The planting was evaluated in November of 2004 for survival and growth. The
plants had averaged 7 feet in height and 38 inches in width, and all of the plants had produced
seed heads. No plants have been lost since the 2003 evaluation. The plants appeared to be
healthy, vigorous, and well established.
An evaluation is scheduled for 2005.
Keeler Farm
This giant sacaton windstrip planting is located in Deming, New Mexico on Keeler Farms. The
planting was installed in July 2002 using transplants grown at the LLPMC. The windstrip is
located on the west side of an irrigated field and will protect the cropland from wind erosion
during the windy season (February - May). The planting will provide evaluation data on giant
sacaton for use in windstrips in this part of New Mexico. The planting was evaluated in
November of 2004 for survival and growth. The plants had averaged 7 feet in height and 38
inches in width, and all of the plants had produced seed heads. Survival has remained constant
since the last evaluation, and all of the plants appear to be healthy and vigorous. However, this
planting does have a serious weed problem. African rue is growing in the windstrip and must be
controlled to prevent damage to the planting, and also to keep it from spreading to the adjacent
cropland. Mr. Keeler is aware of this problem and has initiated a chemical control program.
An evaluation is scheduled in 2005.
