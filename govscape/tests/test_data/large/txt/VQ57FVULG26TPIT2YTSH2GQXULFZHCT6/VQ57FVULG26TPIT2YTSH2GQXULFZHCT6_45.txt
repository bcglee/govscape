Study Number: NMPMC-P-9901-RA
Blunt Panic (commonly called vine mesquite in New Mexico) is a native, stoloniferous,
perennial, warm-season grass. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soil, and chiefly in moist
sites along stream and ditch banks. It is fair-to-good forage for livestock and wildlife, and it can
withstand heavy grazing. Because of its stoloniferous habit, Blunt panic often grows in dense
stands and may be used to stabilize washes and prevent soil erosion. It is in high demand in New
Mexico for use in riparian restoration grass seedings. However, it is not currently in commercial
production.
Blunt panic seed typically has a low germination rate, mainly due to a low percentage of seed fill.
Populations of Blunt panic typically have three ploidy levels; diploid (2n=36), triploid (2n=27)
and tetraploid (2n=36 and 2n=40). Of the three ploidy levels present, only the diploid plants were
sexual in their mode of reproduction. The triploid and tetraploid plants are facultative apomictics
with both sexual and apomictic florets.
Blunt panic bulk seed collections were made from 80 collections throughout New Mexico. In
1983, seedlings were transplanted to the field into non-replicated accession rows. Plots were two
rows of 14 plants per row. In 1995, seed was hand harvested for each of the 80 accessions in the
preliminary evaluation field. In 1997, germination tests were conducted on the 80 accessions.
The previous plant breeder selected the accessions that displayed the best seed fill and
germination rates (40â€“60 percent). These accessions are listed in the following table:
