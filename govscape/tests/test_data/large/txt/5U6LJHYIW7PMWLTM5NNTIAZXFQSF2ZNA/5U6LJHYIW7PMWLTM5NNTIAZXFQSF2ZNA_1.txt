If seeding directly outdoors plant 4 or 5 seeds every
18 inches after the last expected frost. Thin to one
when plants reach 4 to 6 inches. So as not to damage
the roots of the desired plants, clip unwanted plants at
ground level rather than pulling them.
Management
Wild tobacco can be periodically fed with a dilute
liquid or small amount of dry fertilizer. Manure can
be added to the soil mix in addition to or in lieu of
fertilizer. Irrigate if conditions become droughty but
wild tobacco is susceptible to disease problems when
the soil is keep too moist. Pruning flowers can
stimulate leaf growth. Harvest the leaves before frost
and dry in bundles to retain moisture as they cure.
