Unfortunately, not all people are equally able and willing to understand the root causes behind coyote
conflicts in suburbia. Intentional feeding of coyotes, which seems to be especially likely to lead to
aggression in some individual animals, is difficult to stop solely by means of local anti-feeding ordinances or
statutes (local law enforcement always has tasks of a high priority). However, neighborhood peer pressure
can be very effective in dealing with the single individual who persists in putting out food for “poor, hungry
coyotes”. The message that concerned neighbors can forcefully convey is that one person’s feeding a coyote
puts everyone’s children and everyone’s pets at risk.
And then, there are those folks who simply haven’t a clue as to how humans should relate to wild
animals: The Los Angeles County Veterinary Public Health Services reported the following incident in La
Verne (Los Angeles County), which occurred on May 29, 1999: “A 27-year-old male was bitten on the lip
after trying to pick up and kiss a coyote…” (Karen Ehnert, D.V.M., M.P.V.M., L.A. County, pers. comm).

I am indebted to Rex O. Baker, who invited me to co-author his 1998 paper on this topic, presented at the 18th Vertebrate
Pest Conference. Much of our understanding of the urban coyote problem in southern California is a result of his personal
experience and research. Craig C. Coolahan provided data from Wildlife Services reports on human safety incidents in California
from the late 1990s to the present; many of these reports resulted from incidents to which Wildlife Services specialists Joe R.
Bennett or Leo Fisher responded.
