Concurrent with an increasing, expanded human population in Southern California was a change in
human attitudes toward predators. As agricultural endeavors gave way to tracts of houses, organized
predator control efforts that once protected livestock enterprises languished. Those who enjoyed hunting or
sport shooting had to venture further away from the populated Los Angeles basin to engage in such
activities. Thus, coyotes became increasingly habituated to the presence of a human population that largely
ignored them, provided them an environment rich in food resources, and sometimes intentionally fed them,
perhaps out of a developing “Disney mentality” toward wildlife.
This hospitable environment that developed in Southern California may be somewhat unique.
However, some of these same factors attracting coyotes into suburbia have occurred in other suburban
environments, particularly in the West, and apparently have led to an increased incidence of coyote conflict
with people and pets, albeit a decade or two later than in the Los Angeles region. Others have pointed out
that large mammalian predators, which were originally locally exterminated by ranchers and other early
settlers as they moved westward, have now repopulated large areas of the country, thanks in part to legal
protection, cessation of predator control, and a tolerant or even protective public attitude. In this regard,
interesting parallels exist between coyotes and other species. For example, David Baron’s recent book The
Beast in the Garden (2004) explores the return of mountain lions into the Front Range residential
communities of Colorado, including their attacks on pets and humans. He raises the issue that these
predators have now learned that humans are not a threat, and in fact, society has no idea how to deal
effectively with such conflicts involving large predators that are now increasing in number and distribution.
Management and Education Needs
We believe that many conflicts between coyotes and humans in suburbia can be avoided. However,
to reverse the current trend, authorities and citizens must act responsibly to correct coyote behavior problems
before they escalate into public health and safety risks. When appropriate preventive actions are taken before
coyotes establish feeding patterns in suburban neighborhoods, further problems often can be avoided.
However, this requires aggressive use of scare devices and hazing, as well as correction of many
environmental factors that have attracted coyotes into the neighborhood. Once attacks on pets have become
frequent, or if human-associated food sources have been used by coyotes for an extended period of time (i.e.,
for several months or more), lethal control techniques will likely be required to prevent continued attacks on
pets or future attacks on children or adults.
When aggressive behavior in a coyote develops, we know of no alternatives to removal of the
offending animals. In suburban situations, both shooting and foothold trapping have been employed, with
trapping having the greatest observed effect of re-instilling the fear of humans in coyotes. A 7- to 10-day
trapping period using careful, selective trap placement in areas frequented by the offending coyotes is usually
sufficient to re-instill their fear of humans. Eradication of all coyotes in the area is neither attempted nor
necessary. The remaining coyotes using the area often disperse after removal of 2 to 5 coyotes; this is
partially dependent on the size of the area, the number of coyote family units using the area, and the existing
level of fear in the coyotes (Baker and Timm 1998). While lethal control of coyotes in suburban and urban
areas is always controversial, the predictable consequences of inaction or delayed action is an escalation of
the problem, with a concurrent increased risk to people (especially small children) and pets.
Preventive actions, if taken before suburban coyotes reach the stage of killing neighborhood cats and
small dogs, can greatly reduce the risks of coyote attacks on people. Such preventive measures include the
following:
• Reduce food resources in the habitat
• Reduce dense landscape habitat (prune & thin)
• Exclude predators using fencing, where possible
• Maintain predators’ “natural” wariness of humans by hazing and scaring methods
