Intentional feeding of coyotes (and other wildlife, such as bears) by park visitors is likely a principal
cause of the predators losing their fear of humans. People also unintentionally provide food to wildlife:
campgrounds or public use areas in parks often provide easily available food items, either from careless
storage of foods or from garbage containers that are not animal-proof or are full to overflowing.
Coyote Attacks on Humans
A series of aggressive encounters of “habituated” coyotes and suburban residents in Southern
California, including the first known fatality from a coyote, was described in a paper by Howell (1982). He
provided details of encounters in which at least 8 persons were attacked by coyotes in Los Angeles County
from 1978 to 1981; the fatality was to a 3-year-old girl attacked in the front yard of her home in a Glendale,
CA residential area. Howell noted reports of aggressive coyotes in Los Angeles County attacking adults and
children, as well as preying on neighborhood dogs and cats, over a 12-year period beginning about 1970.
Subsequently, Carbyn (1989) published accounts of coyote attacks on children, citing incidents that occurred
in National or Provincial Parks, mostly during the 1980s. Of the 14 attacks he reported, 4 resulted in “major
injuries” to small children. He concluded that these 4 serious attacks were predatory in nature: “Coyotes
appeared to have lost fear of humans and regarded the children as prey” (Carbyn 1989:445). He further
noted that coyote habituation, which he believed led to attack behavior, “has been widespread in national
parks and urban areas where this predator associates humans with food at campgrounds”.
Attack Data from California
Baker and Timm (1998) summarized coyote-human safety incidents from 1988 through 1997 in
California involving 53 individuals in 16 locations, in which 21 individuals suffered coyote bites. We
provided detailed case histories on 13 incidents or clusters of incidents, while noting that more than 32 other
individuals experienced human safety incidents with habituated or aggressive coyotes during this same
period. Six years later, Timm et al. (2004) were able to document 89 coyote incidents from California during
the period 1978 through 2003, of which 48 had occurred from 1998 through 2003, indicating an obvious
increase through time (Figure 1). Most incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland
interface, with the largest number of incidents occurring in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties.
None of the incidents we report involved coyotes that were shown to be rabid. Examples of coyote attacks
on humans from our Southern California data set include the following:
• Pomona, CA, April 23, 2001, 4:30 pm: A 54-year-old woman fought, using an axe handle, with a
large coyote that had attacked her small poodle in her back yard. She received bites and/or scratches
on her leg in the melee, and despite her efforts, the coyote killed the poodle and jumped over the
fence carrying the carcass. A coyote had previously killed 3 cats as well as a neighbor’s dog.
Wildlife Services officials responded to the incident and shot what they believed was the offending
coyote. However, the woman underwent post-exposure rabies treatments.
• Griffith Park (Los Angeles, CA), July 20, 1995, 4:00 pm: A coyote approached people in the park,
and was chased away from the area at least once. It then returned to attack a 15-month-old girl
wearing a jumpsuit. The toddler suffered 7 puncture wounds to her right thigh (through her
clothing), along with bruises and scratches. The coyote attempted to carry the child away, before
her mother was able to rescue her. This was one of 6 coyote incidents occurring in Griffith Park
between March and July 1995, in which coyotes attacked and or bit children or adults. Five adult
and 3 subadult coyotes, comprising 2 family groups, were removed by a private pest control firm,
and no further incidents occurred in the park.
• Simi Valley, CA, June 6, 2004, 7:00 pm: A coyote grabbed a 3½-year-old boy, playing in his yard,
by his head and neck and tried to drag him away. His mother rescued the boy, but injuries to his
head and face required 13 stitches. The same coyote had attacked two boys (ages 2 and 3) in their
back yard, and then an 8-year-old boy playing street hockey, on adjacent properties in the same
