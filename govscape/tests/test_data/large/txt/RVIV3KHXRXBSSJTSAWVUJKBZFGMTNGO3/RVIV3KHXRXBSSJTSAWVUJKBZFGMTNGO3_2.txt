neighborhood, within a 15-minute period preceding this attack. The coyote was located and shot by
police. County animal control personnel subsequently determined that a number of coyotes in the
neighborhood were being intentionally fed by night-shift guards at this gated community.
More recently, Timm et al. (2005), via increased access to newspaper reports through Internet
searches of NewsBank and LexisNexis databases, were able to find additional reports of coyote attacks on
humans from the last 3 decades. We reported in excess of 160 human safety incidents in California
involving coyotes since the early 1970s. However, we know that this most recent data set is incomplete:
some incidents are never reported to authorities, some agencies or entities that receive such reports do not
share this information with researchers or others, and some reports are discarded after a few years or are not
maintained in a manner that is easily accessible.
Since publishing our summaries of coyote attack data, we have received criticism from
representatives of animal welfare and animal protection groups, who have stated that we have exaggerated
the risks that urban coyotes pose to humans, and in doing so have created unnecessary fear of coyotes in
people (see Fox 2006). However, our definitions of what constitutes an “attack” or a human safety threat are
consistent with current practices within California. Under provisions of “Proposition 4”, the 1998 anti-trap
initiative approved by voters, padded foothold traps (i.e., Number 3 Victor SoftCatch® or similar), can be
used to capture coyotes only when a public health or safety emergency exists (Secretary of State 1998). A
determination of whether a human health or safety emergency exists is made by the California Department of
Fish and Game or by USDA Wildlife Services, depending on the circumstances of each incident.
From our most recent data set of coyote incidents from 1977 through 2004, our analysis determined
the following trends:
• 74% of coyote attack incidents occurred in the last decade (1995 through 2004)
• Injury to one or more persons occurred in 78 of 165 attack incidents
• 51% of the persons sustaining injury were adults or teenagers
• 23% of all coyote attacks were associated with the presence of pets (primarily dogs); that is, humans
encountered aggressive coyote behavior toward dogs that were being walked, and in some cases
people sustained injury in the act of attempting to rescue their pets from coyote attack.
