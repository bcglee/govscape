Coyotes Nipping At Our Heels: A New Suburban Dilemma

Abstract: In the 1970s, coyote attacks on humans in urban and suburban environments began to occur, primarily in Southern
California. Such attacks have increased in number, and since the late 1980s coyote attacks on people have been reported from at
least 16 additional states and 4 Canadian provinces. Attack incidents are typically preceded by a sequence of increasingly bold
coyote behaviors, including attacks on pets during daylight hours. In suburban areas, coyotes can habituate to humans as a result of
plentiful food resources, including increased numbers of rabbits and rodents, household refuse, pet food, water from ponds and
landscape irrigation run-off, and intentional feeding. Cessation of predator control has also contributed to coyotes’ loss of wariness
toward humans. Preventive (e.g., habitat modification) and corrective actions (e.g., hazing) can be effective if implemented before
coyote attacks on pets become common. However, if environmental modification and changes in human behavior toward coyotes
are delayed, then removal of offending coyotes is needed to resolve threats to human safety. Coyote attacks on humans in suburbia
are largely preventable, but the long-term solution of this conflict requires public education, changes in residents’ behavior, and in
some situations, the means to effectively remove individual offending animals.

Introduction
Throughout most of the history of humankind’s interaction with coyotes (Canis latrans), conflicts
have revolved around the issue of predation on livestock, particularly sheep and goats. Indeed, most applied
research concerning coyotes and coyote management in the last 30 years has dealt with assessing coyote
predation impacts to livestock, and the means either to prevent or reduce such damage, particularly in
Western North America (see the Literature Cited section in Knowlton et al. 1999).
One constant theme in discussing coyotes and their relationship to the environment is their enormous
adaptability. Many authorities consider the coyote prior to the 18th Century to have been primarily an animal
of the open plains or short-grass prairies (Young and Jackson 1951, Gipson 1978, Parker 1995). However,
by the middle of the 20th Century, coyotes had spread northward into most of Alaska and across much of
western and central Canada, and southward through Mexico and into Central America. They remained
largely absent, however, in the U.S. east of the Mississippi River (Young and Jackson 1951). However, by
last part of the 20th Century, coyotes had become established in all of the contiguous 48 states (Parker 1995).
Reasons given for their phenomenal range expansion, other than their adaptability, include human activities
such as introduction of livestock, clearing of forests, extermination of wolves (which will compete with and
kill coyotes), and alteration of habitats in ways that provided improved access across natural geographical
barriers, and even intentional introductions by hunters. This range expansion occurred within essentially the
same period that coyotes in many localities were being trapped, shot, poisoned, snared, and otherwise
harassed in efforts to limit livestock depredation.
Widely regarded as an opportunistic species in terms of their food habits and behavior, coyotes in
some circumstances will habituate to the presence of humans and human-associated food resources. Perhaps
one of the first published descriptions of “habituated” coyotes was a report in Young and Jackson (1951:69),
where they relate a 1947 report from Yellowstone National Park in which park staff described two coyotes
that were habituated to tourists. Park rangers noted that while in the past, park visitors “were lucky to even
see a glimpse” of a coyote, now two coyotes were extensively observed begging for food and posing for
pictures, causing tourist traffic jams along the main park highway… an occurrence “until now unheard of in
Yellowstone’s colorful history.”
