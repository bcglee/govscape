We also looked at the season in which attacks took place, in an effort to evaluate Carbyn’s (1989)
idea that such attacks, especially on children, are primarily predatory in nature. We noted that attacks were
more common during May through August (Figure 2). This corresponds with the season when adult
coyotes’ food demands would be highest, as they are provisioning pups at this time of year. However,
coyote pairs with pups are also likely to more aggressively defend territory and den sites during the
reproductive and pup-rearing seasons. Further, likely confounding effects are the tendency of people to be
more active out of doors during late spring and summer, and the increased presence of children playing in
yards and neighborhoods during summer vacation.
Coyote Attacks throughout North America
While California has incurred far more coyote attacks on humans than other states, the problem
seems to be arising and possibly increasing in other states. We currently have documentation of at least 17
coyote attacks on humans from 16 states (other than California) and 4 Canadian provinces; essentially all of
these incidents occurred during the period 1988 through 2006 (Table 1). Most of these incidents are known
to us as a result of media reports from newspapers. We have intentionally excluded all incidents in which the
attacking coyote was proven to be rabid.
We suspect that some of the factors that lead to the development of habituated, aggressive coyotes
more likely occur in Southern California than elsewhere, although it is possible that the circumstances that
lead to coyote attack have simply developed earlier in suburban Southern California than they have
elsewhere, and that this problem may become increasingly serious in other localities. This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that we have been able to access many newspaper accounts of coyote attacks in
California prior to the late 1980s, but almost none from other states or provinces.
Recognizing Problem Behaviors in Coyotes
There is a predictable sequence of observed changes in coyote behavior that indicates an increasing
risk to human safety (Baker and Timm 1998, Timm et al. 2004). We define these changes, in order of their
usual pattern of occurrence, as follows:
1) An increase in observing coyotes on streets and in yards at night
2) An increase in coyotes approaching adults and/or taking pets at night
3) Early morning and late afternoon daylight observance of coyotes on streets and in parks and
yards
4) Daylight observance of coyotes chasing or taking pets
5) Coyotes attacking and taking pets on leash or in close proximity to their owners; coyotes chasing
joggers, bicyclists, and other adults
6) Coyotes seen in and around children’s play areas, school grounds, and parks in mid-day
7) Coyotes acting aggressively toward adults during mid-day.
A number of cities and states have adopted this sequence of behaviors for the purpose of collecting
reports of coyote incidents and for determining an appropriate action threshold to implement coyote control
measures. In many localities that use such a system, removal of problem coyotes is initiated when coyote
behavior progresses to steps 4 or 5.
Why Has This Problem Developed?
Reasons for the development of coyote aggression toward humans, and the consequent increase in
attack incidents, have been postulated from the time of the first reports. Howell (1982:21) described
development of urban sprawl into Southern California mountain ranges, providing miles of urban interface
with native brushy habitats, where “coyotes feel very comfortable at home, refusing to retreat…” He further
noted that this suburban habitat provides them with “…abundant food choices such as readily available
household garbage, pet foods, small pets, vegetable gardens, water, and vast assortments of other leftovers
