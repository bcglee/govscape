Summary: GPFARM is a farm/ranch decision support system (DSS) designed to assist in strategic
management planning for land units from the field to the whole-farm level. This study evaluated the regional
applicability and efficacy of GPFARM based on model performance for dry grain yield, total soil profile
water content, crop residue, and total soil profile residual NO -N across a range of dryland no-till

experimental sites in eastern Colorado. Field data were collected from 1987 through 1999 from an on-going,
long-term experiment at three locations in eastern Colorado along a gradient of low (Sterling), medium
(Stratton), and high (Walsh) potential evapotranspiration. Crop rotation alternatives were winter wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), proso millet (Panicum miliaceum
L.), and fallow. GPFARM simulations generally agreed with observed trends and showed that the model was
able to simulate location differences for the majority of model output responses. GPFARM appears to be
adequate for use in strategic planning of alternative cropping systems across eastern Colorado dryland
locations; however, further improvements in the crop growth and environmental components of the
simulation model would improve its applicability for short-term (tactical) planning scenarios.
Introduction
The USDA-ARS Agricultural Systems Research Unit (ASRU) has developed a decision support
system named GPFARM (Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management). GPFARM 2.6
encompasses stand-alone components such as a user interface, simulation model, and databases (Ascough et
al., 2002; McMaster et al., 2002; Shaffer et al., 2000) that, when used in conjunction with other components
(e.g., farm economic budgeting and multi-criteria decision analysis modules), provide a unique decision
support tool for farmers and ranchers. The general purpose of GPFARM is to serve as a whole-farm/ranch
DSS for strategic planning across the Great Plains by considering production, economic, and environmental
impact analysis, thereby allowing assessment and comparison of alternative agricultural management
systems. GPFARM has been evaluated in several different ways, including general farm/ranch testing with
producers (i.e., expert opinion evaluation), experimental field plot or scientific testing, and trend analysis.
However, further evaluation is needed at a whole-system level to quantify crop yield and water quality model
output response, especially for strategic planning under the environmental conditions in the immediate target
area of eastern Colorado. In addition, many corrections and enhancements have continued to be made to the
GPFARM 2.6 modules. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (i.e., multi-
year) performance of GPFARM 2.6 in simulating grain yield, soil water, crop residue, and soil NO -N across

a north-to-south potential evapotranspiration (PET) gradient in eastern Colorado dryland cropping systems.
Additional results and discussion concerning this study are presented in Ascough et al. (2007).
