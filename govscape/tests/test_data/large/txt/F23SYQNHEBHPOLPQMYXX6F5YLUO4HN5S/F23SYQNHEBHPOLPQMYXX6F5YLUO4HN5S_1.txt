GPFARM Simulation Model
The GPFARM DSS is a conglomerate of major components designed to serve as an extensive
decision support tool for farmers and ranchers. These components include: (1) a Microsoft Windows-based
graphical user interface (GUI); (2) Microsoft Access databases containing soil, crop, weed, climate, chemical,
and economic parameters needed in the simulations and analysis of results; (3) an object-oriented modeling
framework (Shaffer et al., 2000) that integrates modules for simulating soil water dynamics, N dynamics,
crop growth, weed growth, beef cattle production, pesticide transport, and water/wind erosion; (4) a set of
management scenario analysis tools (e.g., a multi-criteria decision making model (MCDM), summary report
tables, and a stand-alone farm/ranch economic analysis); and (5) an internet-based GPFARM information
system (http://infosys.ars.usda.gov) containing numerous links to information on various farm and ranch
management options. Modules that are directly related to the model output responses presented in this article
include the crop growth module, soil properties module, PET module, water balance module, and C/N cycling
module. For a more comprehensive description of these modules and the GPFARM DSS, see Ascough et al.
(2002), McMaster et al. (2002, 2003), and Shaffer et al. (2004).
Site Description and Cropping Systems
The long-term sustainable Dryland Agroecosystems Project (DAP) was initiated in 1985 at three
sites in eastern Colorado (Sterling, Stratton, and Walsh) to evaluate the effects of cropping intensity on
production, water use efficiency, and selected soil chemical and physical properties (Peterson et al., 1993).
This experiment has three major variables: (1) PET gradient, (2) topography (slope position), and (3)
cropping intensity under no-till management (fig. 1). Soils at each site were under conventional tillage crop-
fallow management for at least 50 years prior to the initiation of this study in 1985.

soil, and cropping system variables (from Peterson et al., 2000).
The three sites represent a gradient of increasing PET from north to south, but all have similar long-
term mean annual precipitation (ranging from 15 to 17 inches; table 1). The deficit water (i.e., precipitation
minus open-pan evaporation) also increased from north to south, with -46, -52, and -63 inches/year-, for
Sterling, Stratton, and Walsh, respectively. At each site, a topographic variable is represented by summit,
sideslope, and toeslope landscape positions. Each slope position is correlated to a unique soil series common
to the geographic area such that nine different soil series are represented across the three sites (Peterson, et
al., 1993).
