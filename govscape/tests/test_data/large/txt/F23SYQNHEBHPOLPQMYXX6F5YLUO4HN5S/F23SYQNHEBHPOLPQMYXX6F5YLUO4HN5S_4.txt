the Walsh site. In general, GPFARM had more trouble simulating location differences for grain yield than for
total soil profile water content, crop residue, and total soil profile NO -N. Overall GPFARM performed
3
reasonably well in simulating long-term statistical differences among the eastern Colorado dryland locations
along an evapotranspiration gradient.
Overall analysis of simulation results using the discrete evaluation statistics shows that GPFARM
appears to be adequate for strategic planning of cropping systems across multiple dryland locations, but the
simulation model may be lacking in accuracy for predictions on a short-term (tactical) planning basis
(especially for grain yield). It is anticipated that improvements in the crop growth and environmental
components of the GPFARM simulation model will improve its accuracy for both strategic and tactical
applications.
