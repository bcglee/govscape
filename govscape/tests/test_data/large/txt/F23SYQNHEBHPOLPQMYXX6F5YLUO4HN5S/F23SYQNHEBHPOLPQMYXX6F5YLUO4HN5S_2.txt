Various cropping systems, representing cropping intensities, were placed in strips across soil series
sequences at each site. The cropping systems were wheat-fallow [WF], wheat-corn (or sorghum for the Walsh
site)-fallow [WC(S)F], and wheat-corn (or sorghum for the Walsh site)-millet-fallow [WC(S)MF]. Each crop
was present in each cropping system every year. The cropping system were as follows: WF had an intensity
factor of 0.50 (cropped years divided by total years in the rotation), and the intensity factors for WC(S)F and
WC(S)MF were 0.67 and 0.75, respectively. Crops were planted using no-till planters and drills that only
disturbed the soil in a narrow band to allow for a seed row. Fertilizer N (32-0-0) and P (10-34-0) were applied
based on annual soil tests for available N and P.
Measured Data
Measurements relevant to the evaluation of GPFARM 2.6 included daily weather data, grain yield,
soil water content, crop residue, and soil residual NO -N. Additional variables were measured (e.g., final dry
3
matter biomass), as described by Peterson et al. (2000), but were not considered in this study. An automated
weather station at each site measured daily maximum and minimum air temperature, mean relative humidity,
precipitation, total solar radiation, wind direction, and mean wind speed. Grain yield was measured with a
plot combine, while total aboveground biomass was measured at harvest by hand sampling. The harvest
indices (grain yield/total biomass) were determined from the hand samples. Soil water content (12 inch
increments down to a depth of 60 inches) was measured at strategic times (e.g., bi-weekly during summer
months) in each cropping system by use of a neutron attenuation probe. Crop residue was measured at
planting and immediately before harvest for each crop in each cropping system. Soil residual NO -N (at
3
varying increments down to a depth of 60 inches) was measured prior to planting to determine fertilizer N
requirements.
Results and Discussion
Grain Yield Evaluation
With the exception of corn yield, model performance was reasonable for long-term mean annual
yields between locations (table 2) but was less satisfactory for individual years. Only winter wheat and proso
millet were grown at all three locations, with Walsh having significantly lower observed yields than Sterling
and Stratton for both crops. Both corn and winter wheat had significantly higher observed yields at Stratton,
whereas proso millet yield was significantly highest at Sterling. GPFARM simulations of winter wheat grain
yield showed significantly lower yields at Walsh (matching the observed) but could not distinguish
statistically (P < 0.05) between Sterling and Stratton (with simulated yield at Stratton being slightly less than
Sterling, the opposite of the observed). Model simulations of proso millet yields could not statistically
distinguish between the three locations, although the simulated yield at Walsh was lowest, matching the trend
of observed yields being lowest at Walsh. In addition, GPFARM was able to correctly simulate corn grain
yield differences between Sterling and Stratton.
