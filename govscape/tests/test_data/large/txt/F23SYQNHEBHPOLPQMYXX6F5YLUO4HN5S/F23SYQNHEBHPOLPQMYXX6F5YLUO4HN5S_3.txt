Soil Water Content, Crop Residue, and Soil Residual NO -N Evaluation
3
GPFARM better simulated trends between locations (both magnitudes and differences) in total soil
water content and crop residue than it did for grain yield predictions (with the exception of sorghum grain
yield). Similarly, GPFARM correctly distinguished differences in total soil residual NO -N between locations
3
but moderately underestimated mean values at all three locations. For total soil profile water content and
residual NO -N, Stratton had the highest values for both observed and simulated totals (table 2). Sterling had
3
the highest amount of crop residue based on observed data, but GPFARM simulations showed Stratton with
the highest amount of crop residue. In simulating differences between locations, GPFARM was able to
correctly distinguish statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between all locations for both crop residue
and total soil profile residual NO -N. For total soil profile water content, observed data showed statistically
3
significant differences between Sterling and the other locations, but no difference between Stratton and Walsh
(table 2). In comparison, GPFARM predicted statistically significant differences between all locations for
total soil profile water content (table 2).
Summary and Conclusions
Compared to other more complex agricultural system models, and considering the intended purpose
of GPFARM (i.e., to serve as a whole-farm/ranch DSS for long-term strategic planning across the Great
Plains), the model appears to have reasonably simulated average grain yield (with the exception of corn), total
soil profile water content, crop residue, and total residual soil profile NO -N pooled across landscape
3
positions at the eastern Colorado experimental sites. Overpredictions in corn yield was a result of the inability
of the GPFARM crop growth model to correctly respond to soil water deficits at critical growth periods.
GPFARM model performance was reasonable for long-term mean annual winter wheat, proso millet, and
sorghum grain yield predictions, but was less satisfactory for winter wheat and proso millet on an annual
basis (data not shown). GPFARM simulations of total soil water content in the profile were quite reasonable.
Crop residue predictions were also very reasonable for Sterling and Stratton, but not as robust at Walsh.
Simulated mean values of total residual soil profile NO -N were moderately underestimated at all three
3
locations.
GPFARM correctly simulated long-term location differences in corn grain yield, crop residue, and
total soil profile residual NO -N. Results were mixed on simulated statistical differences in winter wheat
3
grain yield, proso millet grain yield, and total soil profile water content. However, the model correctly
predicted that the Sterling and Stratton experimental sites were generally more productive in grain yield than
