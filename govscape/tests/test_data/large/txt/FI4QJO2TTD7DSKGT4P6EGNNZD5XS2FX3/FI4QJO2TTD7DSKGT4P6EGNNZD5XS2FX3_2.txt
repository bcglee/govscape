Why did cowbirds become parasitic nesters?
Cowbirds followed the great herds of bison feeding on the
insects that are attracted to the bison. The herds moved almost
constantly. The birds did not have time to build nests and rear
their own young and still keep up with the bison. Thus they started
laying their eggs in the nests of other birds.
Blackbirds are also remembered because of their use in stories and
nursery rhymes. Such an example is “Sing a Song of Sixpence.”
Sing a song of sixpence, The king was in the counting house,
A pocket full of rye; Counting out his money;
Four and twenty blackbirds, The queen was in the parlor,
Baked in a pie. Eating bread and honey.
When the pie was opened, The maid was in the garden,
The birds began to sing; Hanging out the clothes;
Wasn’t that a dainty dish, When along came a blackbird,
To set before the king? And snipped off her nose.
