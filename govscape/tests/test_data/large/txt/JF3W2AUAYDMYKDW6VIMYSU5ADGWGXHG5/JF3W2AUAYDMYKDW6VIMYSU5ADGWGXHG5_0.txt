Slit-Ti11age
Slit-tillage is the cutting of a narrow slit through a plowpan to promote
deep rooting. One of the primary advantages of slit-tillage over subsoiling
is that on coarse-textured soils slit -tillage produces a long-term residual
effect, whereas the effects of subsoiling last only for one season. In 1985
we found 5-year-old slits that were still functional in promoting soybean root
growth through a plowpan.
I n the second year of an experiment on a Dothan soil at Headland,
Alabama, yields of peanuts, corn, and soybeans grown with slit-tillage were
equal to yields with in-row subsoiling. Yields with no-till were 62, 86, and
64 percent of maximum yields of corn, peanuts, and soybeans, respectively. I t
appears that on this soil, some form of tillage is essential for maximum crop
yields.
Starter Fertilizer and Lime Placement For No-ti1l Grain Sorghum
A field study was initiated in 1985 to evaluate the response of grain
sorghum to starter fertilizer placement, in-row tillage to disrupt tillage
pans, and deep injection of lime to amend subsoil acidity. The study was
conducted on a Hartsells fine sandy loam. A factorial arrangement of 3
tillage-placement methods x 5 soil amendments was incorporated in a ran­
domized complete block of 4 replications. The amendments included 1)
starter fertilizer (20 lb/acre each of N and P O ; 2) 700 lb/acre dolomitic
2 5
limestone slurry i n a water base with an anionfc'polymer to aid in suspen­
sion; 3) starter fertilizer + lime; 4) a polymer check; and 5) a water-only
check. The amendments were placed either 1) in the subsoiler track (16-in
depth); 2) i n a narrow slit (3/16 in wide, 7 in deep) below the subsoiler
shank; cr 3) incorporated with a fluted coulter 3-5 inches beside the row to a
3-inch depth.
Substantial increases in plant growth occurred only when starter or
starter + lime were applied in conjunction with sore form of deep tillage
(subsoiler or slit) (Table 1).
