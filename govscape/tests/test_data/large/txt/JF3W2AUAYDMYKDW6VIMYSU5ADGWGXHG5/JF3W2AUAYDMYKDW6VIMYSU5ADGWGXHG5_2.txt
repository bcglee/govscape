coastal plain soils. The Benndale and Dothan soils had well defined root
restricting tillage pans. Tillage pans existed in the Lucedale soils, but
they were generally not well defined and yield response to in-row subsoiling
was not consistant.
In 1984, the summer crop was changed from soybean to grain sorghum.
Wheat yields i n 1984 and 1985 followed the same treatment trends as previous
years. Grain sorghum yields (Table 2), however, did not follow the same
trends as soybean. Regardless of tillage system prior to planting wheat,
in-row subsoiling was needed for top sorghum yields. On Benndale and Dothan
sandy loam soils, deep tillage prior to planting wheat resulted i n higher
sorghum yields than no tillage prior to planting wheat, but this tillage did
not substitute for in-row subsoiling at sorghum planting.

Cropping Systems for No Tillage Corn Production
When winter cover crops are harvested for grain, cut for hay, or used for
grazing, their use will generally off-set production costs and a cost free
mulch is available for the summer crop. I t is not always feasible, however,
to use the winter cover crops as cash crops and the production costs have to
be charged to the summer crop. When winter cover crops cannot be used as cash
crops, planting annual legumes which produce N that can he used by subsequent
grain crops can help off-set and sometimes eliminate costs of growing the
1egume.
Early maturing legumes, especially when planted early in the fall, can
provide adequate mulch for conservation tillage and sufficient N for summer
crops which have low N requirements and relatively late optimum planting
dates. These legumes, however, generally do not provide adequate N for corn,
which has to be planted early and has a high N requirement. Since soybean
will sometimes provide up to 1/3 of the N needed by corn, growing corn in
rotation with soybean in a cropping system with reseeding clover may eliminate
the need for applying N fertilizer to corn.
