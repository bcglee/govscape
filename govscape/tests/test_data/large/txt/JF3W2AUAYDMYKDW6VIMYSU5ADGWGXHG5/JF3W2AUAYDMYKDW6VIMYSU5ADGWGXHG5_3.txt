This study was conducted on a Wynnville sandy loam soil at the Sand
Mountain Substation i n North Alabama and on a Dothan sandy loam soil at the
Wiregrass Substation i n the Coastal Plains of South Alabama. The two year
cropping systems were 1) fallow-corn-fallow-corn, 2) clo ver-corn-cl over -
corn, 3) fal low-soybean-fallow-corn, and 4) clo ver-soybean-reseeded clover-
corn. The clover was 'Tibee' crimson clover. Sidedress N rates for corn were
0, 60, 120, and 180 lb/acre. Irrigation was used a t the Coastal Plain
location but not at Sand Mountain.
A t corn planting, higher clover yield and total N but lower N
concentration at Sand Mountain than the Coastal Plain location (Tahle 3) are
attributed to a later corn planting date a t the Sand Mountain location (18
April vs 27 March). Higher yield and N production for clover following
soybean than corn at both locations i s due to reseeded vs planted clover.
When corn was planted i n the summer of 84, the clover was a t the very early
bloom stage and seeds had not been produced; but when soybeans were planted i n
May of 84 the clover was mature and had produced adeauate seeds for a self
seeding system. The self seeded clover i n the soybean canopy had established
a stand i n late August of 1984 while clover following corn was not planted
until November.

Corn yield (Table 4) a t both locations was good. Judging from the 0 N
rate a t both locations, soybeans preceedinc corn w i l l provide as much N to the
corn as a winter legume. The clover-soybean-clover system however, was by far
superior to any of the single legume crops preceedinp ccrn. Although the
preceeding legume crops contributed N to the corn, they had no effect on the
amount of N fertilizer required (120 lb/acre) for optimum yields at the Sand
Mountain location. They did, however affect yields which were 110, 130, 130,
160 bu/acre for systems 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A t the Coastal Plain
location, the preceedinp cropping systems did not affect yield potental but
did affect N fertilizer requirement. When corn followed the clover-soybcanÂ­
clover system, 60 lb/acre of N fertilizer was adequate and 120 to 180 lb/acre
were required for the other preceeding cropping systems.
