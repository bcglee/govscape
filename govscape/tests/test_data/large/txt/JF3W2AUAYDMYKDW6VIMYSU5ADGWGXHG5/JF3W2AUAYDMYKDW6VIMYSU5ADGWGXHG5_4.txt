Tillage In-row Subsoiling, and Starter Fertilizer for Peanuts
This study was conducted for 3 years in the Coastal Plain (Wiregrass
Substation, Headland) of Alabama. The soil which was a Dothan fsl, contained
a root restricting hard pan 8 to 10 inches deep. Except for the starter
fertilizer treatments, fertilizer and lime was applied according to soil test
recommendations. Treatment variables consisted of tillage (disk-chisel-disk
and no tillage into killed rye), fertilizer combinations, in-row subsoiling,
and fertilizer placement. The liquid fertilizer combinations were: none, N
alone, N-P, and N-P-K. Application rate was 150 lb/acre of total material and
nutrient rates were 22 lb/acre N, 22 lb/acre P O and 8 lb/acre, K 0.

Subsoiling (10 t o 12 inch depth) was with an in-row subsoil unit.
For nonsubsoiled treatments, the same planting unit was used but without
subsoilers. Fertilizer placement was deep and 3 X 2. For the deep placement,
a tube was welded behind the subsoiler shank and the fertilizer was placed
near the bottom of the track. The peanuts were planted on twin 7-inch rows on
36-inch centers and the 3 X 2 placement was directly between the paired rows
and two inches deep.
Each year interactions occurred between tillage and in-row subsoiling
(Table 5). Within the conventional tillage system, in-row subsoil ing reduced
yields, but it, increased yields within the no-tillage system. In 1983, yields
were low and the only response to the starter fertilizers was a yield
reduction from the 3 X 2 placed N-P-K. Yields were good i n 1984 (3700
lb/acre) and excellent in 1985 (4900 lb/acre). Within the conventional
tillage system, the starter fertilizers improved yields i n 1984 (up to 900
lb/acre), but had no effect i n 1985. I n 1984, maximum response was obtained
with the application o f N alone. Within the no tillage system there was a
positive yield response to starter fertilizers both years. The 3 X 2 placed
starters were superior t o the deep placed starters i n 1984 (3660 vs 3300
lb/acre) but not i n 1985. With the 3 X 2 placed fertilizer i n conjunction
with in-row suboiling (which was the superior treatment), N alone was as
effective i n improvina yields as the N-P and N-P-K combinations.
