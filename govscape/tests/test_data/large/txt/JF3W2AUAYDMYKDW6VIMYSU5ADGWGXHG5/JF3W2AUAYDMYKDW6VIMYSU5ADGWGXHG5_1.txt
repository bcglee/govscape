Grain yield generally followed the same trend as plant growth (Table
1). Maximum grain yield (83 bu/acre) occurred when starter was applied in
the subsoiler track. Averaged over amendments, yields were 59, 65, and 60
bu/acre = 3.7) for subsoiliny, slit- tillage, and no deep tillage,
respectively.
Previous research has shorn that soybean yield response to s l i t tillage
improves with each successive season which is due t o the cumulative effect o f
residual slits. After 3 seasons, yields from slit- tillages surpassed those of
conventionally subsoiled plots. Whether the injection o f lime into acid
subsoils can further improve crop performance remains t o be proved. The test
w i l l be continued on a number of coarse-textured, essily compacted soils with
acid B t horizons throughout the Southeastern Coastal Plain.
Tillage Systems for Double Cropped Wheat and Grain Sorghum
Research conducted from 1981 to 1984 demonstrated that the best tillage
system for dcuble-cropped wheat and soybean was deep tillage prior to planting
wheat and no tillage prior to planting soybean (Proceedinps of the Seventh
Annnual No- tillage Systems Conference, pp. 146-150). Tillage systems prior t o
planting wheat were no tillage, disk, chisel plow, and turn plow. Soybean was
planted with and without in-row subsoiling. Wheat yield differences between
deep tillage systems (chisel and turn) were generally irsignificant. A key
finding o f this research was that yield of soybean following deep tillage for
wheat was as high without as with in-row subsoiling even on soils with root
restricting hardpans. The soils used i n this research (Table 2) are typical
