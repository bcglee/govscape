Except for limiting cases, Eq. [1] will normally yield Cr Finally physical uncertainties may affect not only the

at the inlet, i.e., between the soil column and the inlet res- inlet, Eq. [1]. The latter presumes that the flow is perfectly

one rather stagnant, not only the boundary conditions may

can be used to describe the flow if two phases are present.

where L then stands for the column length. In general, a
boundary layer is possible upstream from a given position
but not downstream. When a reservoir is in contact with the
column inlet (x = 0) a boundary layer will form for x < 0,
i.e., the concentration can vary rapidly for x < 0 in the
reservoir from Cr (x = 0) to Co. In that case D may stand
for the molecular diffusion, Do, with Do «. D in the column,
as long as the flow in the reservoir is laminar, i.e., if it is
not well mixed. Thus when Do is considered negligible, the
thickness of the boundary layer is infinitely thin and an ap-
parent, or macroscopic; discontinuity between Co and Cr is
sustainable at x = 0.
In contrast, at the column outlet (x > 0) no boundary
layer can develop so there must be continuity in concentra-
tion at x = L. For nonsteady state conditions a growing
boundary layer must be considered but this does not affect Reply to "Comments on Boundary Conditions for Dis-
