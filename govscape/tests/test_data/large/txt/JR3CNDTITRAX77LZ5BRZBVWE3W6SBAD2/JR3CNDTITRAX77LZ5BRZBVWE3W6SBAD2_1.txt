2, this solution differs from the flux-concentration that can
derived indirectly from BR upon application of Eq. [1] above.
This inconsistency may reflect inherent weaknesses in the
either CA and/or BR, although we tend to believe that CA
is at fault because of its failure to preserve mass (see our
Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the discussion above shows some per-
ils in Brenner's solutions that are not easily solved. As a
more plausible alternative to Brenner's approach, we suggest
to regard concentrations inside the column to be unaffected
by the exit boundary; this allows us to use solutions for a
semi-infinite system, notably LA for flux-averaged and LB
for volume-averaged concentrations. Contrary to CA and
BR, these two solutions are properly related through trans-
formation [1] above. Thus, LA correctly preserves mass when
integrated vs. time at any point in the profile (or effluent),
while LB always preserves mass when integrated versus
depth.
2. From the discussion above and our Fig. 4, it follows
that both LA and BR correctly predict the retardation factor
R in the system, and hence that both solutions can be used
safely to derive adsorption or exchange coefficients from col-
umn displacement experiments (as opposed to batch equi-
libration). This conclusion is valid independently of the value
of P. However, we do acknowledge that application of BR
