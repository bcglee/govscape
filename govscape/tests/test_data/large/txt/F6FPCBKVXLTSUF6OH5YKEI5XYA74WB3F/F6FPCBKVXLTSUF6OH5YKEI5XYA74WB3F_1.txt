When an LBAM is found, a 200-meter radius around the find will be defined and
pheromone-impregnated twist ties will be attached to trees, shrubs, and other fixtures
within the area at a rate of 250 dispensers per acre. These dispensers allow for the
continual release of pheromone over the course of 90 days. The dispensers will be
removed at the end of their useful lives. In some cases they may be replaced for a second
treatment. When treatments are completed, all dispensers will be removed.
The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts of eradication treatments of small, isolated
populations like the ones in Vallejo. Due to the nature of the dispenser and the pheromone
itself, there will be no impacts to the human environment including nontarget species
because the product is contained in dispensers that are tied to fixtures and will be removed
after treatment. In addition, there will be no negative cumulative effects from this action in
combination with any other actions because there are no impacts to the human
environment including nontarget species. The most likely impact will be the reduction of
the LBAM population due to disruption of mating; eventually leading to the eradication of
LBAM within the eradication area, and ultimately, within the State of California.
APHIS and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) previously
discussed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS) treatments with LBAM-specific pheromone at various locations.
There are three federally threatened or endangered species within the eradication zone: salt
marsh harvest mouse, California clapper rail and soft bird’s beak. In addition, the Napa
River which separates Mare Island and the rest of Vallejo, California is listed as critical
habitat for the steelhead trout. A marsh area that lies mostly between Interstate Route 780
and Dillon Point Road, just to the north of Southampton Bay (see attachment 2) has been
designated as critical habitat for the soft bird’s beak, a federally listed plant. The soft
bird’s beak is normally pollinated by bees and tortricid moths are not known to be
pollinators. A no effect determination for listed species and critical habitat has been made
for all the species and critical habitat because the pheromones will not affect species other
than the LBAM, and the dispensers will be tied to trees and other fixtures that will remain
in the treatment areas until removal after 3 months. In addition, there are two monarch
butterfly overwintering sites on Mare Island. However, the pheromone is specific to
LBAM mating disruption and will not harm or disturb the mating of the monarch butterfly.
There are no disproportionate adverse effects to minorities, low-income populations, or
children in accordance with Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income Populations,” and
Executive Order 13045, “Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and
Safety Risks.”
APHIS’ finding of no significant impact for these three treatment areas is based upon the
expected limited environmental consequences, as analyzed in the EA. An environmental
impact statement (EIS) must be prepared if implementation of the proposed action may
significantly affect the quality of the human environment. I have determined that there
