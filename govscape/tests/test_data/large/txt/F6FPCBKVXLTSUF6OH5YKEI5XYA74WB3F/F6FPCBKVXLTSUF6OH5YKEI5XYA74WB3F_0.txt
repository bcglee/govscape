Finding of No Significant Impact
Eradication of Isolated Populations of Light Brown Apple Moth in California
Revised Environmental Assessment
November, 2007
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), has prepared a revised environmental assessment (EA) that analyzes potential
environmental consequences of eradicating isolated populations of light brown apple moth
(Epiphyas postvittana) (LBAM) in California. The EA, incorporated by reference in this
document, is available from:
U.S. Department of Agriculture
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
Plant Protection and Quarantine
Emergency and Domestic Programs
Emergency Management
4700 River Road, Unit 134
Riverdale, MD 20737â€“1236
The revised EA analyzed alternatives consisting of (1) maintaining the Federal quarantine
order without further action by APHIS (no action alternative), and (2) continuation of the
Federal quarantine order along with eradication of isolated populations of LBAM in
California with the use of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) and/or LBAM-specific
pheromone (treatment alternative). The revised EA evaluated the potential impacts from
eradication treatments of small, isolated populations and determined that any potential
impacts would be limited. Since the circumstances surrounding each isolated population
are unique, each site will be considered in a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) prior
to treatment. This FONSI addresses the treatment for LBAM of multiple sites within a
defined eradication area in Vallejo, Solano County (see attachment 1).
Treatment in the Vallejo Eradication Area
In August 2007, three 200 meter radius sites were treated using pheromone dispensers that
are attached to trees, shrubs, and other fixtures at a rate of 250 dispensers per acre. Since
the initial treatment of these areas four additional male moths were found in the near
vicinity. While not anticipated, it is possible that additional moths may be found in the
vicinity. An eradication boundary has been defined (see attachment 1) and can be found
on the CDFA website (www.cdfa.ca.gov) The eradication area consists mostly of
commercial and residential areas. The area has several high schools, middle schools,
elementary schools, pre-schools and private schools. There are numerous recreational
parks and areas in the eradication area. A marina is located on the Napa River just off the
North Bay where there is a ferry service to and from San Francisco throughout the day.
The treatment regime to be employed within the eradication area is similar to the previous
treatments in the area, i.e., pheromone twist ties will be used, but Btk will not be used.
