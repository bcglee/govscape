measuring the ratio of the signal intensities at m/e 322 and 328
(internal standard) and reading the concentration of TCDD from the
calibration plot. The detection limit in the actual samples was
obtained by multiplying the noise level by 2.5 which was considered
the maximum amount of TCDD which could be present in the sample.
The percent recovery was measured using the absolute signal
intensity for the internal standard and mass spectrometer response
factors measured by analyzing standard solutions of internal
standard .
Validation
Samples which showed detectable concentrations of TCDD or
which were questionable were reanalyzed by removing a second
aliquot and reinjecting onto the GC/HRMS. For this validation,
the high mass channel is centered at 321.8936 and the low mass
channel at 319.8965, the second most abundant molecular ion of
TCDD. All other conditions were as reported above. The theo-
retical ratio of intensities is 0.78 (m/z 319.8965: m/z 321.8936).
The analysis permits us to calculate a concentration of TCDD
based on the absolute signal intensity observed at m/Â£ 321.8936
using response factors determined for the mass spectrometer from
analysis of standard solutions of TCDD. Based on the percent
recovery measured above, the quantitation is adjusted to 100%
discovery.
Validation of TCDD is considered acceptable if the observed
ratio of signals is 0.78 + 0.10.
