limits for each sample region are as follows:
State Average Detection Limit Range
Washington 0.9 ppt 0.2-2.0 ppt
Oregon 1.9 ppt 0.5-3.0 ppt
Northern
California 2.7 ppt 0.4-6.0 ppt
Controls 1.8 ppt 0.1-3.0 ppt
Clearly, no human exposure, documentable by milk analyses, is
evident at the detection limits shown above.
In the course of this study, an important observation was
made with reference to the analytical science of parts-per-
trillion detections. Nine samples appeared to be positive at
levels of 0.7 to 11 parts-per-trillion during the first round of
analyses in our laboratory. These samples were then reextracted
using the second milk portion and submitted to us and to Mr.
Robert Harless at the EPA Research Triangle Park laboratory.
The sample identity was not known to us. In all cases, the
reanalyais gave a "not detected" result in both laboratories at
detection limits lower than for the first analyses.
This approach of checks and replicate analyses, carefully
designed by EPA scientists, permitted the analytical workers to
avoid reporting out "false positives". Moreover, it is evidence
of the nonprejudicial manner in which government science has
sometimes been undertaken. We can speculate that the first round
of apparent positives was due to handling errors either in the
