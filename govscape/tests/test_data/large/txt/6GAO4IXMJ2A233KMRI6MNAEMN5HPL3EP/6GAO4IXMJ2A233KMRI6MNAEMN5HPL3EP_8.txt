Although the methods vary somewhat with sample type, there
are some steps which are common to all. A tissue sample is first
dissolved in an alkaline solution which serves to solubilize in
water all the fat and protein material. Nonpolar materials, such
as TCDD, are then extracted into hexane, and most of the original
sample material is left behind in the water layer. (When analy-
zing a soil sample the first step is the extraction of nonpolar
components into hexane.) Once the sample is in hexane, the
hexane layer is cleaned up by washing with concentrated sulfuric
acid and performing one or more liquid chromatography steps.
These procedures remove low concentrations of potential inter-
fering compounds so that TCDD can be freed and analyzed at the
parts-per-trillion level without interference from other materials.
The extract is then stored until analysis. Details of these
procedures are contained in Appendix 1.
We employ packed column gas chromatography/high resolution
mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the analysis of the extract. The
mass spectrometer (a Kratos MS-50) possesses the highest resolving
power available in a commercial instrument. We have demonstrated
an ultimate resolution of 180,000 (10% valley) which means we
could distinguish mass 180.000 from 180.001. This resolving
power is not employed for the analysis of TCDD because the
sensitivity would be very poor; rather the resolution is chosen
to be 10,000 which is adequate to separate TCDD from other
interferences, notably polychlorinated biphenyls and DDE (a
metabolite of DDT), which could lead to false positives. A
