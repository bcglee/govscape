Sodium carbonate columns were prepared by adding anhydrous
Na2CC>3 to a height of 8 cm in 25 ml burettes. The burettes were
plugged with a generous amount of glass wool to prevent Na2C03
leakage (Na2C03 was not packed tightly). The column was wetted
with hexane before transferring the hexane layer from the separatory
funnel, followed by a rinse of 25 ml of hexane. All eluate was
collected in 4 ounce jars, then concentrated under a stream of
dry nitrogen to approximately 1 ml.
Alumina was washed by saturating with methylene chloride,
removing excess solvent, then activating at 225°C for at least 24
hours. The column was cooled to room temperature in a dessicator
before use. A 5 cm column was prepared using a disposable pipet
plugged with a small amount of glass wool. The alumina was capped
with 1/4 cm anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove water.
Hexane was used to wet the column before transferring the
sample, dissolved in 1 ml hexane, to the column. A second 1 ml of
hexane was used to rinse the jar and was subsequently added to the
column. The alumina was eluted with two 3 ml portions of CC14,
then with 4 ml of CH2C12- These solvents were used to rinse the
jars before being transferred to the column. The methylene
chloride fraction was collected in a 12 ml conical centrifuge
tube and again concentrated under nitrogen while replacing the
volatile CH Cl2 with isooctane. All other fractions can be
2
discarded. The isooctane was concentrated to a volume of less
than 100 ul, capped with a teflon-lined screw cap, and stored in a
freezer at about -20"C until analysis.
