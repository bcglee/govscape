The final step was florisil chromatography. The florisil
was saturated with methylene chloride and activated in a oven at
165"C for 24 hours. The packing was allowed to cool in a vacuum
dessicator. A five cm column was prepared in a disposable pipet
plugged with glass wool. The column was packed with 10 ml of
hexane under light nitrogen pressure, in an attempt to remove all
air pockets.
The sample, dissolved in one ml of hexane, was added to the
florisil column. The container was rinsed with one ml of 8% (by
volume) methylene chloride in hexane. The column was eluted with
nine ml of 8% CH2C12 in hexane (which removed 80-85% of the PCB's)
and then with eight ml of CH2Cl2Â« The dichloromethane fraction,
which contained the TCDD, was collected in a centrifuge tube, and
the solvent was evaporated to a small volume under a stream of
dry nitrogen. The sides of the centrifuge tube were rinsed down
with one ml of hexane and again the volume was reduced. The tube
was rinsed a final time with one ml of hexane and the solvent
evaporated until the volume was less than lOOul. The centrifuge
tube was capped with a teflon-lined screw cap and stored in a
freezer at about -208C until analysis.
