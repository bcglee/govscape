scientists (Ref. 6), permits us to conclude that, if a detection
is made, it may be 2,3,7,8-TCDD or one of eight of the remaining
21 isomers. Thus, our methodology has some, but not total,
specificity for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. However, we often collaborate
with the EPA laboratory of Mr. Robert Harless, who employs even
higher resolving power gas chromatography that can distinguish
all of the isomers, to verify positive detections.

III. Validation Studies
It is well appreciated among analytical chemistry scientists
that analysis at parts-per-trillion levels is extremely difficult.
This is primarily because of the low levels involved. To gain an
appreciation for this, consider that if one were measuring time
instead of chemical concentrations, one part-per-trillion corre-
sponds to about one second in just over 30,000 years. Compounding
the problem is the fact that most samples contain a multitude of
interferences which can complicate analyses at these levels.
Because of these difficulties, it is important to validate
the analytical procedures used at these low levels. Therefore, it
has become customary for the EPA and its collaborating scientists
to periodically engage in validation studies, principally when a
new method or sample medium is used. Our laboratory has partici-
pated in two validation studies which were designed to test the
analytical capabilities of the method we employ. Both studies
were conducted blindly; that is, extracts containing unknown
amounts of TCDD were prepared by other scientists (Dr. Aubry
Dupuy and his co-workers at the EPA Toxicant Analysis Center in
