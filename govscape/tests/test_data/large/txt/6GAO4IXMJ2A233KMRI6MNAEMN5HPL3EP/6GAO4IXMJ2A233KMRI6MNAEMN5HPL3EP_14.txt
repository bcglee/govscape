are shown graphically in Figures 3 and 4. The correlation of
our results is less good, principally because the samples contain
lower concentrations of TCDD (1-20 parts-per-trillion). Neverthe-
less, the results show that TCDD can be reliably extracted,
detected, and quantitated (albeit less accurately than at higher
levels) in human milk. Furthermore, no "false positives" and
only one "false negative" was found in the validation study and
*/
in the quality control samples which were submitted along
with the extracts of the actual human milk samples.
To minimize the possibility of false positives and to add
certainty to analyses in which detectable levels of TCDD were
observed, a method validation approach was instituted in the
monitoring program as a standard procedure in 1979. According to
this procedure, a sample showing detectable levels of TCDD in one
laboratory is reextracted and reanalyzed in another laboratory
for confirmation. Most of our collaborative work has been
conducted with the EPA extractions laboratory (Dr. Aubry Dupuy)
at the Toxicant Analysis Center, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and
the EPA analysis laboratory (Mr. Robert Harless) at Research
** /
Triangle Park, North Carolina.
^7Quality control samples are extracts containing known
amounts of TCDD which are analyzed along with the true unknowns.
*_*/ The analysis procedure of Mr. Harless is complementary to our
own. He employs capillary column gas chromatography, high
resolution mass spectrometry, which, as previously mentioned, is
capable of distinguishing the TCDD isomers. However, unlike our
laboratory, he does not record signal profiles and works at
somewhat lower mass resolutions.
