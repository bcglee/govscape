The quality control samples done in our laboratory at the time of
our analyses of these sediment extracts tended to be low, and,
therefore, we think that our results are low. Accordingly, we
postulate that TCDD does exist in these samples at a level between
10 and 20 parts-per-trillion. Although the quantitative results
show some variability, we suggest that the important observation
is that all analyses of this sediment showed detectable levels of
TCDD in the parts-per-trillion range.
C. Gulfport Study
Also during 1979, we collaborated with Major A.L. Young of
the United States Air Force to monitor biological samples for
TCDD in the area of Gulfport, Mississippi (Ex. 226). Specifically,
the samples were taken near the Naval Construction Battalion
Center (NCBC), the site where over 15,000 drums (more than 80,000
gallons) of Herbicide Orange had been stored from mid 1968 until
v
mid-1977 (Ref. 1). This area was unfortunately contaminated
with Herbicide Orange, including its TCDD component, because of
leaks in the drum containers.
The concentration of TCDD in the sail is highly variable at
this 1-2 acre site depending on whether or not spills had occurred.
The mean concentration of TCDD at spill sites in July, 1977 was
