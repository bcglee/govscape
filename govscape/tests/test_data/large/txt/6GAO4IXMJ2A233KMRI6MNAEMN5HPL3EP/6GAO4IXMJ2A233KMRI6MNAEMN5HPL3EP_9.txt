/description of the GC/MS analysis and a typical output showing
the resolution of potential interferences are presented in
Appendix 2.
Some considerations of our analytical procedure should be now
pointed out. First of all/ the method allows us to monitor each
sample at the exact mass of TCDD: 321:8936 + 0.0015. This is
accomplished through the use of an internal standard (TCDD with
all chlorine atoms as Cl-37) which serves as a mass standard.
As a result, the analysis is highly specific for any substance
which has the formula C H 0 35C1 37C1. All of the tetrachloro-
12 4 2 3
dibenzo-p-dioxins have this formula. "~
V There are also other compounds which have this combination of
elements. The examples below are illustrative of substances
having the same mass as TCDD. However, having the same mass
does not automatically mean that a compound will behave as TCDD
in our analytical procedure. None of these subatances has been
identified in our analyses, and we postulate that they would be
removed in the sample clean-up or by the gas chromatography.
