Our criteria for assigning a positive detection of TCDD are
as follows:
1. The gas chromatography retention time must be the same
as authentic TCDD.
2. The suspected samples must give a signal at 321.8936
+ 0.0015 as determined by real-time peak matching using
the internal standard TCDD-^Cl s the reference mass.
a
3. The signal intensity ratio of m/z 320:322 must be
1.00:0.78 ( + 0.10).
4. The exact mass of m/z 320 must be 319.8965 + 0.0015
using m/z 321.8936 as a mass standard.
5. The detected signal at m/z 321.8936 must be at least
2.5 times the noise level (refered to hereafter as a
2.5 S/N criterion).
Concluding this section, we note that TCDD can be reliably
analyzed in fat and milk at levels extending down to one part-per-
trillion in milk. These observations are important for they
lend credence to all trace analyses of TCDD done in this laboratory.
Furthermore, as a result of application of the stringent require-
ments cited above and employment of a "method validation approach",
we postulate that TCDD can be reliably detected at levels down to
1 part-per-trillion in similar types of samples.
IV. Analyses of Environmental Samples
Our laboratory has participated in several studies which
have involved the analysis of environmental samples for TCDD.
