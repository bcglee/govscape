Mass Spectrometer Conditions
The electron impact source was used at 70 eV ionizing energy
and an accelerating voltage of 8 KV. The source was set at 260Â°C.
The instrument was tuned to a resolving power of 10,000 (10%
valley definition).
Data were acquired using the standard ion switching feature
pr./ided with the MS-50 (dual ion monitoring). The first analysis
was made monitoring one channel m/z 321.8936 (the most abundant
molecular ion of TCDD having natural isotopic elemental abundances)
and m/z 327.8848 (3 C1 -TCDD, the internal standard) on the second
4
channel. The complete peak profiles were acquired at a bandwidth
of 3000 Hz by scanning of a frequency of about 2 Hz, corresponding
in each case to a mass range of 300 ppm (0.096 amu). The output
of the mass spectrometer was accumulated over about 75 sweeps per
channel using a Nicolet Model 1170 signal averager. The resulting
signals were submitted to a three-point smoothing routine prior
to print-out on an X-Y recorder.
Calculation of Results
Quantitation was achieved by employing the internal standard
"ratio method." Throughout the analysis period, standard samples
containing TCDD and internal standard were analyzed. From these
results, a calibration curve can be prepared by plotting ratio of
the weights of TCDD and internal standard versus the ratio of
signal intensities (intensity at m/z 321.8936; intensity at m/z
327.8848). Residues of TCDD in actual samples were obtained by
