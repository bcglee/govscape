The second study was a collaborative effort with Dr. Brenda
Kimble of the Laboratory for Energy Related Health Research of
the University of California-Davis, and was directed at evaluating
TCDD production in a coal-fired power house. This work has been
published (Ref. 3).
The third project was with the U.S. Veterans Administration.
Its purpose was to examine whether Vietnam veteran exposure to
Herbicide Orange, a 1:1 mixture of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D which
V
contained high concentrations of TCDD, could be documented by
assaying adipose tissue taken ten years after the alleged contact
with Herbicide Orange.
In the remainder of this document, I will: discuss the
analytical methodology used in our laboratory, and the results
of some of the above projects which are based on our analytical
studies.
II. Analytical Methods
The complete analysis of a sample for TCDD consists of two
operations: sample extraction and clean-up, followed by the
actual analysis. The sample extraction method for tissue employed
in our laboratory is called the acid/base procedure and was
originally introduced by Baughman and Meselson (Ref. 4) and then
perfected by scientists at Dow Chemical Company (Ref. 5). It is
essentially the same method as that employed by Dr. Aubry Dupuy
and his co-workers at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.
V To date, there is no firm evidence indicating that 2,4-D
contains TCDD. Therefore, it is assumed that the TCDD in
Herbicide Orange comes from the 2,4,5-T.
