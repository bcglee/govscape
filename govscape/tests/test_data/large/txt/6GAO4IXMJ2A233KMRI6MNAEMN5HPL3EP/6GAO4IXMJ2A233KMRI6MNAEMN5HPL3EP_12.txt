â€¢ Bay St. Louis, Mississippi) and then sent to us in such a way
that we could not know the amounts involved. After analysis,
the results were then compared with the true values.
In the 1977 validation study, standard solutions and extracts
from "spiked" beef fat were studied. See Figures 1 and 2 for a
graphical picture or our results. The original data reported by
us to EPA are given in Table IV of Exhibit 224.
As can be seen from our results plotted in Figures 1 and 2,
the agreement between the reported value and the true value is
quite good. Furthermore, no "false positives" or "false nega-
v
tives" were obtained. Successful detections of TCDD in these
5 gram samples were in the range of 9-81 parts-per-trillion.
Samples containing 1 and 4 parts-per-trillion TCDD were not
identified because they were lower than our detection limit
**/
(ca. 5 ppt). This study shows that TCDD can be reliably
extracted, detected, and quantitated at the low parts-per-
trillion level.
Before beginning the human milk monitoring project in 1979,
it was necessary to validate the extraction and analysis of TCDD
in this medium. This was done in early 1979 in the same manner
as the 1977 validation of standard solutions and beef fat. The
results (submitted to EPA in letter reports see Exhibit 225)
V"False positives" are analyses in which TCDD appears to be
detected even though none is present in the sample. "False
negatives" refer to analyses in which TCDD is present but is
not detected.
**/ Detection limit is the minimum concentration of sample
that can be detected in any given analysis.
