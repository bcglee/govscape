â€¢ found on site and at 3000', 7000', 9000', and 12,000' from the
storage area. The complete data and a map of the area are shown
in Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 5.
These observations appear to be at odds with the commonly
held view that TCDD in soil is immobile (Ref. 7,8). We must
point out, however, that for the usual environmental situation,
movement studies of this nature would not be feasible because the
site of origin of the TCDD (a spray site, for example) would be
contaminated at levels lower than the at parts-per-billion levels
found at NCFBC in Gulfport. Clearly Major Young and his coworkers
have shown farsightedness in taking advantage of an inadvertant
contamination incident to generate useful environmental data.
Young and coworkers (Ref. 9) have also coordinated studies
on other biologicals at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, a one
square mile site that was heavily sprayed with 2,4,5-T (161,000
pounds between 1962 and 1970). The area contained rather high
levels of TCDD in 1973 (10-710 parts-per-trillion). In 1978,
TCDD was still present, but no comparison can be made because of
sampling differences. Based on results from many biological
analyses, it was shown that TCDD accumulates in animal tissues
(detectable levels were observed in nine species of animals).
For example, the liver of beach mice was shown to have up to 1500
parts-per-trillion TCDD, several times the amount in its surround-
;
ing habitat. This work is ongoing, and we are collaborating by
providing analytical support.
