be a systematic error in the quantitation of these quality control
samples. Specifically, our results are a factor of about 3-3.5
times lower than the "true" values. Because our determined values
are always low, we surmise that the error must be systematic and
occurred either in the spiking and extraction laboratory or in the
analysis laboratory. Studies are underway to determine the source
of the error. We believe these errors do not significantly
reflect on the validity of the study. In our view, the key point
is whether TCDD can be detected in these samples; the exact levels
at the low parts-per-trillion range are of secondary concern.
Knowing that nine of the eighteen deer samples were spiked
as quality control samples, we concluded that the remaining nine
samples of deer tissue contain TCDD at an apparent level of
1-10 parts-per-trillion. However, if these determinations are
also systematically low because of an error made in our analysis,
then the levels would have to be raised by about a factor of three,
i.e., the real levels would range from 3 to 30 parts-per-trillion.
We do not have knowledge of the sample code at this
I/
writing. For example, we are unsure whether positive detections
were found only in exposed deer or only in control animals (not
exposed), or both. Therefore, we cannot comment on any trends
in the data and we cannot conclude that spraying of 2,4,5-T
leads to accumulation of TCDD in deer tissue. However, the final
results from this study should permit us to refute or substantiate
VBecause analysis of some samples is still in progress, the
Department of Agriculture has not released the code which identi-
fies particular samples as coming from exposed or from control
deer.
