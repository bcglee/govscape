Sample Extraction Procedure for Soil
A 5-10g sample was accurately weighed in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer
flask and spiked with a known amount of ^CI- TCDD (2.0 - 2.5 ng).
The spike was allowed to dry on the soil before proceeding. Four
ml of 0.2 M ammonium chloride solution (10.7 g/liter) were added to
saturate the soil. The soil was allowed to stand for several
minutes.
Fifty ml of 1:1 (by volume) hexane/acetone solution was then
added; the solution was stirred for 15 minutes using a magnetic
stirrer. The solvent was carefully decanted into a 250 ml
separatory funnel, filtering suspended particles through glass
wool. Another 40 ml of hexane/acetone was added and the soil was
allowed to stir for another 30 minutes. Again, solvent was
decanted and filtered.
The hexane/acetone solution was extracted twice with 25 ml
of IN KOH, followed by one extraction with 25 ml of distilled
water. (Any emulsions formed were broken up by addition of a few
drops of concentrated H2S04-) Several washings with concentrated
H2S04 were done, approximately 10-15 ml each, until hexane and
acid layers were clear. Four or five extractions were generally
necessary.
The hexane layer was washed with 100 ml of distilled water
and excess acid was neutralized by addition of amounts of solid
Na2CO3 to the water/hexane mixture until the neutralization
reaction subsided. The water layer was then removed.
