APPENDIX 1
Sample Extraction Procedure for Tissue
A 1-10 g sample was accurately weighed and spiked with a known
amount (2.0 - 2.5 ng) of ^CI-TCDD. It was then saponified in
I/
15 ml of ethanol and 30 ml of 40% aqueous KOH in a reflux
apparatus for 60 minutes with stirring. The sample should be
completely hydrolyzed before terminating the saponification.
The solution was transferred to a 250 ml separatory funnel
and diluted with 20 ml of ethanol and 40 ml of water and extracted
four times with nanograde hexane. The first extraction was done
with 25 ml of hexane, shaking vigorously for one minute. The
lower aqueous layer was removed to a clean beaker, and the upper
hexane layer was decanted to a 125 ml separatory funnel. The
aqueous layer was then extracted three times more with 15 ml
portions of hexane, each time adding the hexane to the 125 ml
separatory funnel. The combined hexane extracts were washed with
10 ml water to remove excess base.
The combined hexane extracts were washed 4 times with 10 ml
concentrated 112804, or until both layers were clear. As many as
8 extractions may be necessary, depending upon the sample. Again
the hexane was washed with 10 ml water. The hexane layer was
decanted to a 2 ounce jar and concentrated under a stream of dry
nitrogen to approximately one ml.
V A ll solvents are of the highest grade and suitable for residue
analysis.
