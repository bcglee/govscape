the hypothesis that TCDD accumulation does occur in animal tissue
as a result of normal usage of 2,4,5-T. This is particularly
true if these results are consistent (as they appear to be) with
the results from an ongoing EPA study on TCDD residues in deer
' I/
and elk from 2,4,5-T treated forests. Clearly, this present
study will be important for understanding the fate of TCDD which
enters the environment by a "normal" spray application route,
and further details should be sought.
V. Analysis of Human Samples
Our laboratory has provided the analytical support for three
studies designated to determine whether or not TCDD accumulates
in human tissue. These studies involve (a) human liver and
adipose from autopsy cases in the United States rice growing
area, (b) human milk from women in the western forest areas of
the United States, and (c) human adipose from veterans of the
Vietnam conflict. They will be discussed in turn.
A. Human Adipose and Liver Study
During 1977, 44 samples of human adipose and liver were
extracted and analyzed for TCDD in our laboratory.. The samples
originated from autopsy cases in four southern hospitals in the
U.S.: Greenwood Leflore Hospital, Greenwood, Mississippi; Veterans
Administration Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; University Medical
Center, Memphis, Tennessee; and Veterans Administration Hospital,
Little Rock, Arkansas. These hospitals were chosen because they
handle patients residing in or about the principal rice-growing
jV Preliminary results from the EPA study indicate that
measurable amounts of TCDD can be found in animals that have
gazed in 2,4,5-T treated forests (Ref. 12). Other witnesses
in this hearing will testify on this study.
