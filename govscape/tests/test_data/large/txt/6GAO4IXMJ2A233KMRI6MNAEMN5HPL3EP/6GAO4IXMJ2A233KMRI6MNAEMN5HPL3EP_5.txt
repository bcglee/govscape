I. BACKGROUND
Since 1977, our laboratory has provided analytical support
for several different projects involving the determination of
TCDD levels in human and environmental samples. These projects
have been sponsored by various private and governmental agencies,
such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Air Force,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Science
Foundation. A brief overview of these several projects is
presented below.
;Wo/rk in our laboratory with tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD; began in 1977 and was supported by a contract with the
Environmental Protection Agency. The focus of this research was
the analysis of TCDD in a variety of environmental and biological
samples including soil, blood, adipose, liver and fish tissue.
Also during 1977, the analytical methodology currently employed
by the EPA and collaborating laboratories was validated over a
range of 2,3,7,8-TCDD concentrations from 9-81 parts-per-trillion.
During 1978, our work in this area continued with support
from the U.S. Air Force (Major A.L. Young was the project officer)
During that year we analyzed 100 biological and soil samples
taken from sites contaminated with TCDD. The purpose of the work
was to evaluate the environmental fate of TCDD and TCDD uptake
into animal populations. This work was continued in 1979 under a
V TCDD can exist""as 22 different isomers or as various mixtures
of these isomers. Throughout this document, the term "TCDD" is
used to indicate a mixture of TCDD isomers. When the term "2,3,
7,8-TCDD" is used, it refers to that specific isomer of TCDD.
