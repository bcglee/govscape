DIRECT TESTIMONY OF DR. MICHAEL L. GROSS
My name is Michael Lawrence bross. I am professor of
Chemistry and Director of the Midwest Center of Mass Spectrometry
at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. The mass
spectrometry center is one of six regional instrumentation
facilities that were formed in 1978 by the National Science
Foundation. I received my Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry with minor
in Physical Analytical Chemistry in 1966 at the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After one year of postdoctoral
research at the University of Pennsylvania and one year at Purdue
University, I was appointed assistant professor of chemistry at
the University of Nebraska in 1968. In 1972, I was promoted to
associate professor (with tenure), and in 1978, to professor. A
curriculum vitae is attached.
My research interests are divided among three areas, all related
to gas-phase ion chemistry and mass spectrometry: (1) fundamental
properties of organic gas-phase ions, (2) environmental chemistry,
and (3) instrumental developments in mass spectrometry. In the
environmental area, our laboratory has performed numerous analyses
