extraction or the analysis laboratories. Furthermore, the positive
detections, later corrected, illustrate the need for caution in
the interpretation of analytical results at these low levels.
C. Vietnam Veterans Study
The third study on potential human exposure to TCDD in which
we participated was conducted by the Veteran Administration, and
involved the analysis of human adipose taken from veterans of the
Vietnam war and a control group. Fat samples were taken from 33
men, including a control group of 10 who had not served in Vietnam.
As of December, 1979, 22 of the 33 samples had been analyzed, and
dioxin was found in 10 of them (Ref. 11). The Veterams Admini-
stration is currently reviewing the results of the analyses,
v
and their possible implications.
VI. Conclusion
There now exist reliable methods for the extraction, detection,
and quantitation of TCDD at low parts-per-trillion levels in
soils, sediment, and tissue. The validity of the methods is
insured by the validation studies, the stringent criteria employed
V O ur laboratory reported the results of its analyses to the
Veterans Administration on February 13, 1980. In addition, the
results from some of these samples have been qualitatively
confirmed by Mr. Harless at the EPA analysis laboratory. Because
of the possible public reaction to the results and implications
of this study, the Veterans Administration has asked that the
data from our laboratory not be presented in an open forum before
the entire study has been reviewed by independent scientists.
However, the Veterans Administration is amenable to their use in
an iri camejra session, and negotiations are currently underway to
provide protective arrangements for the use of our data in this
hearing. Once these protective arrangements are in place, or the
review is complete, I agree to be recalled in this hearing in
order to present data from this study.
