Three chromatography steps were done, the first being a
silica gel column. No activation of silica was necessary. A 5 cm
column was prepared using a disposable pipet plugged with glass
wool. The silica was capped with 1/4 cm anhydrous sodium sulfate
to remove water, and then wetted with hexane. The sample,
dissolved in 1 ml of hexane, was transferred to the column. A
second ml of hexane was used to rinse the jar and was subsequently
added to the column. Dioxin was eluted with 3 ml of 20% (V/V)
benzene in hexane. All the eluate was collected in another 2
ounce jar and concentrated to a volume of 1 ml.
Alumina was washed by saturating with methylene chloride,
removing excess solvent, then activating at 225°C for 24 hours.
A column was prepared in the same manner as the silica column
above. The column was cooled to room temperature in a dessicator
before use.
Hexane was used to wet the column before transferring the
sample. The jar was again rinsed with one ml of hexane which was
transferred to the column. The alumina was eluted with two 3 ml
portions of pesticide grade CCI^, then with 4 ml of CH2Cl2« These
solvents were used to rinse the jar before being transferred to
the column. The methylene chloride fraction was collected in a
clean 2 ounce jar and concentrated under nitrogen while replacing
the volatile CH2CL2 with hexane. All other fractions can be
discarded.
