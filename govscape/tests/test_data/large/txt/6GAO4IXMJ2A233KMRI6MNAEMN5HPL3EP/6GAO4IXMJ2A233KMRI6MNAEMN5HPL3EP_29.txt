areas of this country. Herbicides, including 2,4,5-T and silvex,
are used annually for this application. No TCDD was found in
any of the samples at a detection limit of 5 parts-per-trillion
on the average (the range of the detection limit for 41 samples
was 1 to 12 parts-per-trillion). Three samples had somewhat
higher detection limits: 17, 19, and 160 parts-per-trillion
because of small sample sizes for the first two and a poor
percent recovery for the third (ca. 1%).
B. Human Milk Study
In 1979, we analyzed 103 human milk samples under the
auspices of a Cooperative Agreement with the EPA. The 72 study
cases were mothers residing in northern California, Oregon, and
Washington state. Control samples were taken from mothers in
Los Angeles and in Alaska, two areas where 2,4,5-T or Silvex
exposure is not likely. The mothers were all volunteers.
Each sample was divided into two equal volumes, and one
volume was extracted and cleaned-up by Dr. Aubry Dupuy and his
coworkers. (The second volume was reserved in the event that
reextration and reanalysis became necessary in order to resolve
questionable results from the first extraction.) The extracts
along with controls were then submitted to us for analysis by
GC/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry. As was discussed pre-
viously, the sample extraction, clean-up, and analysis was first
validated using control samples (see Ex. 225).
No TCDD was detected in any of the samples at detection
limits averaging about 1 part-per-trillion. The average detection
