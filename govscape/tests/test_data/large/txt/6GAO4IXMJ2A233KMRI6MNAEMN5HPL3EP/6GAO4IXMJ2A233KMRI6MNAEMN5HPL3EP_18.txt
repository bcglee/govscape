B. Sediment and Water Study
In 1979, various samples of sediment and water taken from
the Alsea, Oregon area were extracted by EPA and analyzed in our
laboratory (Ex. 225). The water samples were surface water taken
from fourteen sites in the Alsea area. The samples were sub-
divided, extracted, and portions were analyzed by both Mr. Robert
Harless and by us. No TCDD was detected by either laboratory;
i.e., the detection limit varied between 0.008 and 0.020 parts-
per-trillion in Mr. Harless1 laboratory, and 0.004 and 0.080
parts-per-trillion in our laboratory. The average detection
limit using the lower value reported for each sample was 0.011
parts-per-trillion (11 parts-per quadrillion) with a range of
0.004 to 0.020 parts-per-trillion. We can conclude with high
certainty that no TCDD exists in these particular surface water
supplies at levels of 0.100 parts-per-trillion or higher.
Sediment samples were taken below the water at ten of the
fourteen sites investigated above. The samples were extracted by
Dr. Dupuy and coworkers using both a neutral extraction and an
acid/base procedure. In the neutral procedure, any TCDD in the
sediment was removed by extraction into hexane/acetone followed
by the usual clean-up. In the acid/base procedure, the sample
was heated with an alkaline solution (as if it were a tissue
sample) and the resulting mixture was extracted to remove any
TCDD. The samples were analyzed by Mr. Robert Harless and by us.
No TCDD was detected at seven of the ten sites investigated
at a detection limit of less than one part-per-trillion. We
