believe we can say with high certainty that no more than one
part-per-trillion of TCDD exists at these seven sites.
However, at two sites, the results were more ambiguous. For
example, at site #1, one analysis of the five conducted gave a
positive result at 2 parts-per-trillion; all the other analyses
showed no TCDD detected at detection limits ranging from 0.6 to
4 parts-per-trillion. At site #4, two analyses were positive at
1.0 and 1.5 parts-per-trillion, but the results could not be
duplicated by additional extractions and analyses. We can
therefore conclude with certainty that no TCDD exists at these
two sites at levels exceeding 3 parts-per-trillion; however,
lower concentrations may be present.
Finally, the sediment from one of the sites (#9) was shown
to contain significant amounts of TCDD. The results for the
several analyses of this particular sample are as follows:
