second contract directed by Major Young. A new issue was
addressed in 1979: the movement of TCDD in biological samples
in the vicinity of the Herbicide Orange storage area at Gulfport,
Mississippi. The results of the second study have been published
(Ref. 1).
In addition to the Air Force sponsored research, we did the
lead analytical work under a Cooperative Agreement with the EPA
directed at the analysis of TCDD in human milk from mothers in the
western forest areas of the United States. Prior to beginning
this work, we participated in a validation study of the human
milk methodology at TCDD levels of 0-20 parts-per-trillion.
Sediment and water from Oregon were also analyzed during 1979.
This cooperative research program has been extended into 1980.
Another study conducted during 1979 was aimed at evaluating
the possible accumulation of TCDD in deer tissue in the Blodgett
National Forest in California. This work was supported by a
grant from the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
A number of other TCDD monitoring studies were conducted in
1979 principally under the auspices of the National Science
Foundation Regional Instrumentation Facility Grant. Three of
these studies deserve mention here. In the first study, we
assisted scientists from the New York State Department of Health
with a preliminary survey of fish from the .iagara River and
from Lake Ontario. The results of this investigation were
announced publicly by Dr. David Axelrod, state health commissioner,
on April 24, 1979 (Ref. 2).
