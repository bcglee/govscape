Second, the possibility of assigning a positive detection for
TCDD to the side of a peak from a very intense interference signal
is minimal because entire peak profiles are gathered for each
analysis. Consequently, only a complete peak corresponding to
TCDD is designated as TCDD. Therefore, the method is reasonably
unsusceptible to "false positives." Third, if a detection is

made, the analysis is repeated and both C^2H4°2 ^3 ^~
(m/z = 321.8936) and C H 0 35C1 (m/z = 319.8967)" are monitored.

These are both expected signals from the TCDD molecule and should
be in the ratio of 1.00:0.78 (we expect to reproduce this ratio
to within + 10-15%). This procedure adds additional assurance
to a detection. Fourth, the measurement of the amount of TCDD,
if detected, is made by considering the intensity of the signal
relative to the internal standard. This method (called the
internal standard method) is recognized as the best way to obtain
accurate quantitative results.
As is well-known, TCDD can exist as 22 different isomers.
Probably the most toxic isomer, that produced in the manufacture
of 2,4, 5-trichlorophenol, 2,4,5-T and silvex, is 2., 3,7,8-TCDD.
The mass spectrometer, as we operate it, is not capable of dis-
tinguishing among isomers; only gas chromatography can do this.
Therefore, a gas chromatograph is used in series with a mass
spectrometer in our and most laboratories doing TCDD analyses.

designated as m/e.
