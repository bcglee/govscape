less than 0.2 parts-per-billion TCDD, whereas "old" spill (light
stain, mild odor) and "new" spill (heavy stain, strong odor) sites
were contaminated at levels of about 40 parts-per-billion and 200
parts-per-billion, respectively.
Clearly, the area contains TCDD at levels much higher than
soil exposed tc normal spray application of 2,4,5-T. However,
the high levels allowed Major Young to develop an analytical
program to address the question of movement of TCDD in the
environment. Our role in the program was to analyze biological
samples.
As has been reported by Young, Thalken, and Cairney (Ex. 226),
we found detectable levels of TCDD in a variety of biological
I/
samples (crayfish, mosquitofish, frog, etc). The concentration
of TCDD decreased smoothly from levels of 100 to 7200 parts-per-
trillion on site to levels of 45 parts-per-trillion at a distance
of 7000 feet from the site and 20 parts-per-trillion at 9000 feet.
The same trend was observed for samples collected later, in
June, 1979. For example, for composite crayfish/mosquitofish
samples, levels of 175, 88, 31, 20, and 6 parts-per-trillion were
V We have also participated in monitoring of TCDD from a
more normal environment. One study was conducted on fish in
the Niagara River and in Lake Ontario in collaboration with
scientists at the New York Department of Health. TCDD was
detected at levels of 4.6 parts-per-trillion in a small mouth
bass and 6.5 parts-per-trillion in a brown trout, both from
Lake Ontario (Ref. 2). The results are consistent with the
observations from Gulfport, but the origin of the TCDD and the
extent of the contamination is not clear from this preliminary
study. It is our understanding that more extensive investi-
gations are underway in the New York Department of Health.
