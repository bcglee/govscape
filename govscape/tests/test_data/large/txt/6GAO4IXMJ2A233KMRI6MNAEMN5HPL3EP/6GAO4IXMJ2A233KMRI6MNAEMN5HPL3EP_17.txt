'Environmental media which have been analyzed in these studies
include soil, water, sediment, fish and other aquatic biological,
and fat tissue from deer. Four of these studies are discussed
below.
A. EPA Soil Study
During 1977, 16 soil samples from the forest area of Grays
Harbor County in the State of Washington were extracted and
analyzed in our laboratory. These soil samples were collected
three hours after a normal spray of 2,4,5-T and then 15 days, 37
days, and 72 days after spraying. They were composites of the
first 1" or the first 2" of topsoil. No analyses were conducted
on the 15-day samples.
Twelve samples were found to contain detectable amounts of
TCDD varying from 8 to 40 parts-per-trillion (Ex. 224), with an
average detection limit of 6 parts-per-trillion and a range of
2 to 9 parts-per-trillion. No trend could be distinguished in
terms of sampling time. That is, 1 of 2 samples taken on the day
of spraying contained 20 parts-per-trillion TCDD; 5 of 6 samples
taken after 37 days showed TCDD at levels ranging from 8-31 parts-
per-trillion, and 6 of 8 samples after 72 days contained TCDD at
levels of '12 to 40 parts-per-trillion.
In addition, ten animal tissue specimens were extracted and
analyzed, but no TCDD was detected at an average detection limit
of 4 parts-per-trillion (range of 1 to 7 parts-per-trillion).
