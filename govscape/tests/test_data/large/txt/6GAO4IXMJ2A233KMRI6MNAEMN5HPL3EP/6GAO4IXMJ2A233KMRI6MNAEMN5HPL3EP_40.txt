APPENDIX 2
Gas Chromatography/High Resolution
Mass Spectrometry (GC/HRMS) Analysis
At the time of analysis, the side of the centrifuge tubes
was washed thoroughly with aproximately 100 ul of hexane or
isooctane using a graduated syringe. During the washing, the
solvent was allowed to evaporate until a volume of-^50 ul remained
This remaining volume was accurately measured; usually three-
fourths was replaced in the centrifuge tube, and the fourth
remaining in the syringe was used for the gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry analysis.
Mass Spectrometer
A Kratos MS-5076 ultra high resolution mass spectrometer was
used for this analysis (ultimate resolution = 180,000). The mass
spectrometer was interfaced via a direct coupling to a Perkin
Elmer Sigma II gas liquid chromatograph. Data acquisition was
accomplished with a Nicolet Model 1170 signal averaging computer.
Gas Chromatography
The column was a 61 x 1/4" O.D. glass containing a Dow mixed
phase packing. Typical operating conditions were: Helium flow
rate of 15 cc/min; injector 270°: column temperature program 1.5
min at 250° and then ramped at 10° c/min to 3008C and held there
until the dioxin had eluted. The GC/MS interface was a simple
glass lined stainless steel capillary and was held at an average
temperature of 2508C. Typical retention time was 3.4 minutes
(peak width at 10% height approximately 40 seconds).
