D< Blodgett Forest Study
Finally, a carefully designed study on the impact of 2,4,5-T
on Blodgett Forest located in central California has been under-
taken by the.U.S. Forest Service, and is nearing completion. We
participated in a part of this study testing whether TCDD would
accumulate in deer tissue. Deer were penned in an 11 acre area
in the Blodgett Forest. The herbicide 2,4,5-T was sprayed at an
application dose of three pounds per acre. Prior to the spraying,
fat biopsies were taken from all deer to be used as controls.
After the spraying, three deer each were sacrificed at intervals
of 2, 14, and 28 days. Again samples of tissue (fat, liver,
muscle, and bone marrow) were taken. Two additional deer were
collected from areas not known to have been sprayed with 2,4,5-T,
and tissues from these deer were used as controls (Ref. 10).
The tissue samples were extracted and cleaned up by Dr.
Aubry Dupuy at the Toxicant Analysis Center in Bay St. Louis,.
Mississippi using the "acid/base" procedure. The extracts were
submitted to us (along with a suitable number of control samples)
for analysis using our standard method of gas chromatography-high
resolution mass spectrometry. The results of our analysis as
originally reported to the Forest Service are presented in Table 3.
TCDD was detected in 18 of the samples of deer tissue that
were submitted to us for analysis (Ex. 227). We have recently learned
that nine of these samples were quality control samples that had
been spiked with known amounts of TCDD (Ex. 228). There appears to
