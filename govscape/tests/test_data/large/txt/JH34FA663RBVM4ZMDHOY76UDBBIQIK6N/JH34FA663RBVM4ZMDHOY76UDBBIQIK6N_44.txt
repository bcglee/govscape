Dobrenz et al. (1969) concluded that stomatal densities in blue panicgrass were
different across all populations with the lower canopy leaf having higher stomatal density.
It was also stated that the abaxial leaf surface had significantly more stomates than the
adaxial surface. This difference in stomatal numbers between the two leaf surfaces was
also observed with P.I. 237110 and Ganada. Sundberg (1985) concluded that higher
densities of smaller stomates on the leaf surfaces of non-succulent, xerophytic plants is an
adaptation that allows for higher daytime transpiration rates resulting in lower tissue
temperatures. Although no leaf temperature data were obtained, P.I. 237110 has a
significantly lower stomate density than Ganada which may suggest that the leaf tissue in
P.I. 237110 can better withstand higher daytime temperatures.
Stomate densities on the sheaths of both plant populations were determined to be
significantly different. Ganada showed 111 stomates mm-2 and P.I. 237110 had 92
stomates mm-2 (Fig. 6). These differences were not surprising due to Ganada having
significantly higher stomate densities on the leaves. The higher stomate densities on the
sheaths of the Ganada population may also contribute to a lower tolerance to drought. No
studies dealing with stomate densities on the sheaths of grass species could be located.
P.I. 237110 has an SLW of 2.66 mg cm-2 compared to an SLW for Ganada of 2.92
mg cm-2 (Fig. 7). Plants with a higher SLW have been shown to exhibit higher
photosynthetic rates (Nelson and Schweitzer 1988).
Leaf Area
Total leaf area for P.I. 237110 was much greater at 40.5 cm2 than for Ganada
which was measured to be 25.3 cm2 (Fig. 8). In studies with winter wheat (Triticum
