different species when grown under the same conditions and may vary within the same
species under different environments (McGinnies and Arnold 1939). Water use
efficiency (WUE) is defined as the amount of water required by a plant to produce one
unit of dry matter. Stanhill (1986) stated that although it is the plant's biological
processes that determine the ratio of transpiration to dry matter production, these are
strongly and differentially affected by the physical environment, in particular, by the
vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere during daylight hours. This relationship is such
that the transpiration ratio increases markedly with atmospheric demand, making plant
water loss less productive in those situations when transpiration is highest.
Water Use in Rangeland Plants
Water that is available for plant growth is one of the most limiting factors on
rangelands throughout the world. Plants that are efficient in terms of water use may have
a competitive advantage over less efficient plants especially during periods of moisture
stress. In general, C plants require about half as much water as do C plants to produce
4 3
one unit of dry matter (Black 1971). The water use efficiency values of 28 species of
Arizona range plants and five crop plants were determined under varying climatic
conditions from 1931 through 1936 at the Desert Grassland Station on the Santa Rita
Experimental Range (approximately 48 km south of Tucson.). Such a comprehensive
evaluation of water use in Arizona range plants of this scale has not been conducted since
that time. The native species included six groups of plants; (1) perennial grasses of the
desert grassland, (2) perennial grasses of the plains grassland, (3) southern tall grasses, (4)
winter annuals, (5) summer annuals, and (6) xerophytic trees and shrubs.
In this study it was determined that as a group perennial grasses were fairly
uniform in WUE throughout the year. There was less difference between species of
different geographical groups than there was of species within the same geographical
groups. Summer annuals had lower total WUE values than the winter annuals. However,
winter annuals were at least as efficient in the use of water as the perennial grasses. As a
group the summer annuals had lower WUE values than the perennial grasses.
The perennial grasses showed wide variation in WUE values under different
climatic conditions. There was also wide diversity within each species as well as
considerable variation between species (Table 1). In the fall-winter-spring period the
most water use efficient grasses were tanglehead, smooth three-awn, and hairy grama.
The least efficient were feather grass, and side-oats grama.
Miller and Hunt (1966) reviewed research conducted to measure the WUE of
most crop plants with emphasis placed on grasses. They found no significant correlation
between WUE and drought tolerance of rangeland grasses. Keller (1953) discovered
significant differences in WUE among genotypes of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata
L.). He determined that the variability expressed in WUE may provide a mechanism for
developing more water-efficient strains. Hunt (1962) studied variation in the WUE
among two genotypes of Elymus junceus Fisch. and Agropyron intermedium (Host)
Beauv. He found significant differences in WUE between species as well as among
genotypes within species. He concluded that this trait was highly heritable and that
selection should result in more efficient water use.
