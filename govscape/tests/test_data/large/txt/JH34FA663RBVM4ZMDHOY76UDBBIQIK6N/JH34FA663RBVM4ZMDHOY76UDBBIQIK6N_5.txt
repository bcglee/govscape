west of the Rio Grande; southern Colorado; Sonora and Chihuahua (Benson & Darrow
1981).
This species grows on thin, rocky soils of both igneous and sedimentary origin. It thrives
in the juniper-pinyon zone, particularly in calcareous soils and on immature limestone
rocklands. Cowania mexicana is also found at the edge of the salt desert and on southern
exposures in the mountain shrub and ponderosa pine types. It is strongly drought
resistant after fully established; less so in the seedling stages. It thrives fully in sunlight
but exhibits fair shade tolerance, especially in the seedling stage. Some variation in frost
sensitivity of seedlings is to be expected from the southern and low altitude strains, also
in vigor when introduced from habitats differing much from the planting site. It is
generally killed by wildfire; old one-stemmed specimens readily killed by chaining,
dozing, or severing of the main trunk. Quite tolerant of winter browsing; removal of 65%
of current twig growth stimulates flowering and reproduction but browsing more than
80% causes plants to deteriorate. It is competitive beyond the seedling stage and suitable
for inclusion in seeding mixtures for exposed rocky slopes within its climatic tolerances1.
The leaf margins roll in slightly which is a characteristic associated with a plant's
increased ability to survive dry conditions.
Where abundant, cliffrose is an important and valuable browse for deer, cattle and sheep,
the chief utilization period being in winter. It is little used by deer, cattle, or sheep during
spring and summer if other succulent forage is plentiful. The branches of this shrub are
brittle and under abusive grazing are liable to be broken and severly damaged. Proper
browsing stimulates lateral bud growth which results in the production of a greater
number of leafy shoots and more forage than where the plant is protected (USDA 1937).
Many species of woody perennials that are native to the shrub-dominated vegetation of
the western U.S. fix nitrogen when infected with the appropriate actinomycete
microsymbiont (Klemmedson 1979). Cowania is an important actinorhizal genus
(Righetti and Munns 1980) and interest in this system has increased as its value in the
revegetation of deteriorated wildlife habitats and rehabilitation of nitrogen-deficient
disturbed areas has become apparent. Cliffrose can pioneer on semi-arid plains, foothills
and mountain slopes, and has been successfully utilized in revegetation efforts (McArthur
et al. 1974; Righetti et al. 1986).
Young and Young (1992) provide the most current information in regard to
pregermination treatment. They state that without pregermination treatment, seeds of
cliffrose have exhibited limited germination. When germination was tested at 55 constant
or alternating temperatures ranging from 0 through 40 Â°C, the mean germination of
optima (defined as not significantly lower than the maximum observed germination and
its confidence level at the 0.01 level of probability) was 13% (Young and Evans 1981).
Soaking seeds of cliffrose in a 3% solution of thiourea increased mean optimal
