Leaf samples of P.I. 237110 were collected and preserved in formalin acetic acid
and alcohol. The tissue was dehydrated with alcohol and imbedded in paraffin (Berlyn
and Mischke 1977). Sections were then cut 15 Âµm thick and stained with saffranin.
The leaf cross section and stomate photographs were obtained using a microscope-
mounted Polaroid camera at 450 X. Visual observations without measurements were
made of the cross sections. Photographs of Ganada could not be created for comparison
due to a lack of plant materials from which to obtain samples.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Stomate Densities
Average stomate densities for the two populations were significantly different.
P.I. 237110 averaged 107 and Ganada averaged 136 stomates mm-2 (Fig. 4.). These
measurements represent an average over all plants that were examined in each population.
Stomate densities for both populations were significantly higher in the lower and middle
sections of the plant canopy than in the upper sections of the canopy. Both populations
also showed significantly higher stomate densities on the abaxial leaf surface (183
stomates mm-2) in comparison with the adaxial side of the leaves (60 stomates mm-2)
(Fig. 5.).
Studies by Dobrenz et al. (1969) of six clones of blue panicgrass revealed an
average of 114 stomates mm-2 on the adaxial leaf surfaces and 122 stomates mm-2 on the
abaxial leaf surfaces. When the data obtained from the six clones were averaged, the
abaxial surface of the leaves had a significantly higher stomate density than the adaxial
surface. These authors also concluded that seedling drought tolerant clones had a lower
stomate density than drought susceptible clones.
Research by Cox et al. (1990) revealed that the stomate density among alkali
sacaton populations ranged from 70 stomates mm-2 for plants collected near Casa Grande,
Arizona to 319 stomates mm-2 for TX-III which was collected near Alpine, Texas. This
study also concluded that alkali sacaton plants with a higher stomate density had a lower
resistance to gas and water vapor movement in and out of the leaf.
