elongation was exhibited by no cotyledon emergence. Radicle length was approximately
75% shorter in this group than fully developed radicles (Jackson et al. 1990).
Honey Mesquite - Screwbean Mesquite Comparisons:
Mean germination percentages for all honey and screwbean mesquite genotypes over all
treatment levels reveal significantly higher mean germination percentages for the honey
mesquite genotypes over the screwbean mesquite genotypes. Observing each treatment
level individually revealed the honey mesquite genotypes to exhibit significantly higher
mean germination percentages than the screwbean mesquite genotypes up to the 20
mmhos cm-1 treatment level. At the 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, one screwbean
mesquite genotype exhibited a significantly lower mean germination percentage (SB 894-
1, 0.2%) than all other genotypes in comparison.
Rooting Experiments - Cottonwood Genotypes:
Mean dry weights (mg) of leaf and root material for all cottonwood genotypes were
collected up to the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level. The 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment
levels did not yield any measurable amounts. Mean dry weight amounts of leaf and root
biomass were calculated for each treatment level. Leaf dry weights generally greatly
exceeded root dry weights. At the control level, there were no significant differences
between genotypes in terms of mean leaf biomass production or mean root biomass
production.
At the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, three genotypes exhibited significantly lower mean
leaf dry weights versus all other genotypes: C-2 40 mg; C-26 65 mg; C-30 44.3 mg. The
largest mean leaf biomass production was exhibited by genotype C-4 at 704 mg. The
highest mean root dry weight was exhibited by genotype C-4 at 46.8 mg.
At the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, there were no significant differences between any
of the genotypes in terms of leaf or root biomass production. The two genotypes
exhibiting the highest mean leaf biomass production were C-3 (161 mg) and C-4 (153.3
mg). The same two genotypes also exhibited the highest mean root biomass production
with 10 mg for genotype C-4 and 8.3 mg for genotype C-3.
In summary, mean leaf biomass production greatly exceeded mean root biomass
production at all treatment levels. Predictably, as the salt concentrations increased,
biomass production decreased. Mean leaf and root biomass production over all genotypes
was significantly greatest at the control level (Leaves: 502.4 mg, Roots: 30.6 mg).
Production at the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level was significantly greater (Leaves: 272.7
mg, Roots: 19.8 mg) than all other treatment levels except at the control treatment level.
The 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level yielded a mean of 71.7 mg for leaves and 3.9 mg for
roots. The 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels yielded no measurable amounts of
biomass.
