is decreased in plants adapted to arid environments while Devlin and Witham (1983) and
Noggle and Fritz (1983) argued that densities are increased in xerophytic plants.
Quarrie and Jones (1977) stated that stomatal density tends to increase with
irradiance during growth. A similar increase is often, but not always, apparent with water
stress. The variable response arises because of two conflicting effects: a general decrease
in cell size with water stress and a decreased stomatal index (stomata as a proportion of
total epidermal cells). Although water stress does not often affect the ratio of adaxial to
abaxial stomatal density (Grace and Russell 1977; Quarrie and Jones 1977), there are
several reports of this ratio increasing with irradiance during growth (Gay and Hurd 1975;
Ticha 1982).
Willmer (1983) stated that in addition to large differences in stomatal density, size
and distribution over the leaf surfaces, there are major genetic differences in both
stomatal density and size between species by at least an order of magnitude. Some
species are hypostomatous with stomata only on the lower (abaxial) leaf surface. Others
are amphistomatous (similar numbers on each leaf surface), and others are intermediate
between these extremes (Baker et al. 1985).
Strobel and Sundberg (1984) suggested that xerophytic plants evolved different
stomatal strategies to deal with water stress. They associated high stomatal densities with
non-succulent xerophytes and stated that average stomatal densities for non-succulent
plants were 165 mm-2. According to Sundberg (1985), in contrast to succulents, the
stomatal densities of non-succulent xerophytes fall mostly within the typical range of
more mesophytic plants and actually include some of the highest stomatal densities
recorded. He also stated that many non-succulent xerophytes have high rates of
transpiration that often increase with increasing levels of evaporative demand. The
apparent evolutionary advantage here is the ability to reduce tissue temperature by
evaporative cooling and avoid a buildup of heat in the tissues. Levitt (1980) has shown
that evaporative cooling due to high rates of transpiration can actually reduce internal
tissue temperatures to below that of the surrounding air.
Sundberg (1985) also explained that studies by Ting and Szarek (1975) showed
that maximum gas exchange occurs in leaves with many small stomates as opposed to a
few, relatively large stomates. Although an individual small stomate will be less efficient
at allowing gas exchange per unit pore area than an individual large stomate, more small
stomates may be packed into a unit leaf area which allows for higher total transpiration
and hence a greater evaporative cooling capacity.
Studies by Dobrenz et al. (1969)10 on alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides Torr.)
demonstrated that plants with higher stomate densities exhibited a lower resistance to gas
and water vapor movement into and out of the leaf. For example, ecotype AC-13 had an
abaxial stomate density of approximately 136 stomates mm-2 and a diffusive resistance of
3.26 s cm-1, while ecotype CO-40, with an abaxial stomate density of approximately 157
stomates mm-2 had a diffusive resistance of 5.37 s cm-1.
Another study by Dobrenz et al. (1969), was undertaken to determine the stomate
density of a wide range of blue panic grass (Panicum antidotale Retz.) genotypes, and the
association between stomate density, drought tolerance and water use efficiency. In this
