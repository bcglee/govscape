germination to 66%. However the use of this very toxic chemical is not recommended
because it is suspected to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Prechilling cliffrose seeds
for 2 weeks at 5 째C produced mean optimal germination of 55%. The incubation
temperatures that most frequently supported optimum germination were 10/20, 10/25,
10/30, and 15/25 째C.
When propagating Cowania plants from seed, a one-month moist and cool period (35 째F-
41 째F) enhances seed germination. Stem propagation can easily be accomplished by
basally treating 3-4 inch, semi-hardwood terminal stems with 0.8% indolebutyric acid
(Borland 1988).
Tucson PMC personnel have propagated numerous plants from seed in the TPMC
greenhouses without the one-month moist and cool period and germination has resulted in
approximately 80%. This propagation process was begun in early March while
temperatures were still relatively cool and a mist system was used to keep the soil moist.
Germination response time was 10 days.
Young and Young (1992) also state that cliffrose has been successfully direct seeded on
rangelands in Utah. Seeds were drilled or broadcast in the fall on sites that had the
competing vegetation reduced and some seedbed preparation had been performed. The
seed was planted at a rate of approximately 5.5 kg ha-1. Container-grown and bare
rootstock of cliffrose have been successfully transplanted into rangeland sites. Alexander
et al. (1974) suggested transplanting relatively young seedlings. Young and Young
(1992) report to have had excellent results with 12- to 18-month old, container-grown
stock that was fully hardened off when transplanted.
Conclusions:
This project has been discontinued. Because cliffrose is a cross-pollinated species and the
genetic component for this population has been derived from three individual collections,
TPMC personnel have determined the genetic base for this population to be too narrow.
This narrow genetic base could very likely lead to establishment, production and
performance problems in the future. It should also be noted that from an economic
standpoint, commercial seed producers can harvest seed from natural stands more
efficiently than producing seed in a cultivated seed orchard.
