Anderson and Ohmart (1985) made the prediction that enhancement of avian and rodent
populations is most likely to be achieved if cottonwood and willow trees are present.
These tree species attract, or are correlated with vegetational factors that attract, the
greatest density and diversity of insectivorous birds. If frugiverous birds are included,
then mistletoe needs to be present. Since mistletoe grows best on honey mesquite, this
tree needs to be included in the riparian vegetation as well. Doves were also associated
with honey mesquite. Gambel’s quail and small grainiverous birds, as well as certain
rodents, were associated with shrubs, and detailed studies showed that quailbush was an
excellent shrub.
Water Conservation:
Removal of riparian vegetation and channeling was practiced into the 1960’s to conserve
water. Based on calculations done at the time, this seemed a reasonable procedure, since
riparian vegetation transpired water and impeded transport of flood water (Brock 1984).
What was not realized during this period was that through a complex series of events,
riparian vegetation can sometimes raise the water table and increase available water. This
can occur because woody species provide local channel stability and resistance to channel
erosion, this allows other species (sedges, rushes, grasses, and forbs) to become
established. As vegetation becomes established, channels typically begin to aggrade (i.e.,
channel elevation will increase as sediment is deposited within and along the banks of the
channel). As this continues, water tables rise (Elmore and Beschta 1987).
Water Quality:
Our increasing awareness of the risks of chemical contamination magnifies another
benefit of riparian vegetation. Riparian vegetation serves as an active sink for nutrients,
organic matter and contaminants. Streamside vegetation traps both sediments and
chemicals generated on agricultural lands in the watershed before they can be transported
to nearby stream channels. This can be particularly important in managing downstream
nitrate contamination. Riparian forest and wetland ecosystems in the watersheds of Lake
Tahoe were found capable of removing 99% of the incoming nitrate nitrogen (DeBano
and Schmidt 1989).
A study by Lowrance et al. (1984) showed that waterborne inputs exceeded streamflow
outputs for all elements. In this study, located in an agricultural area in Georgia, the
percent of nutrient retention in the riparian system varied from 6% for potassium to 68%
for nitrogen. It was also shown that denitrification was one of the important methods of
nitrogen removal in riparian systems. Soils of riparian areas present ideal conditions for
denitrification: high organic matter, seasonal waterlogging, and large inputs of nitrate in
subsurface flow. The conclusion of this study was that removal of the riparian forest
would tend to contribute higher nutrient loads in streams and lower water quality through
loss of nutrient uptake and storage by woody vegetation. It was further concluded that
maintenance of riparian ecosystems is essential to avoid degradation of water quality due
to increased nutrient loss from agricultural watersheds.
