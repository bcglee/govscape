capable of lowering the concentration to only about 50 ppm, and they produce CO in the

light by a process known as photorespiration (Cutter 1971).
Stomate Density
In higher plants, stomates are the regulators of gas exchange, principally carbon
dioxide (CO ), and water vapor. The stomatal pore is formed between two guard cells
2
which are specialized cells of the epidermis. The two basic forms of guard cells are the
elliptical (kidney-shaped) type and the graminaceous (dumbbell-shaped) type . The guard
cells alter in turgor and volume during stomatal movements. This alteration in shape is a
result of differential wall thickening and elasticity. Stomatal aperature is influenced by
changes in guard cell solute levels that are regulated by the metabolism of organic
compounds within the guard cells resulting in the import and export of osmotically active
(mainly inorganic) substances from neighboring cells (Weyers and Meidner 1990).
Carbon dioxide enters the plant primarily through the stomates. As the stomates
open to receive CO , water vapor is released at the same time. When a plant is growing
2
under favorable conditions with an adequate supply of water, the exchange of water vapor
for CO is not detrimental to the plant. The loss of water through the stomates creates the
2
pressure gradient that allows more water and dissolved solutes to be drawn up from the
roots through the plant (Raven et al. 1981). However when water is not readily available
in the soil, water vapor lost through transpiration cannot be as easily replaced and water
deficits within the plant can quickly develop (Sundberg 1985). This problem may be
particularly severe in arid environments and xerophytic plants have consequently evolved
a variety of physiological and morphological features to minimize water loss. The cells
of many desert plants are simply able to withstand reduced water content without injury
(Levitt 1980). Other desert plants have long taproots that allow them to reach available
moisture located deep within the soil while others have extensively-branched shallow
root systems which are efficient at making use of whatever minimal precipitation may
occur. A large number of xerophytic plants lose their leaves, or even whole shoots as
conditions become drier (Levitt 1980).
Over many years it has been recognized that certain modifications of stomates are
characteristic of plants adapted to arid environments. The stomates of many xerophytes
occur at the surface of the leaf or stem or they may be sunken beneath the epidermal
surface. Likewise, the density and size of stomates have been implied as being
xeromorphic adaptations. However, the literature dealing with this issue is full of
contradictions (Sundberg 1985). Sundberg (1985) explained that Haberlandt (1884)
claimed that stomatal densities are relatively low in desert plants. With fewer stomates
per unit surface area there would be potentially less transpiration. In the same year,
Volkens (1884) stated that there is no correlation between the density of stomates and the
xeric environment. In later studies Volkens (1887) and Maximov (1929) claimed that
desert plants may actually have higher stomatal densities which would allow for increased
rates of transpiration that in turn would produce evaporative cooling of leaf surfaces.
Both sides of the issue have continued to be discussed in recent plant physiology
textbooks. Hall (1976), Bidwell (1979), and Ting (1982) expressed that stomatal density
