where this herbicide was used on salt cedar, water levels were deeper than six meters
below the surface when the herbicide testing began. Two years later, after controlling the
stands and leaving dead trees, the water table returned to the surface for the first time in
20 years (Duncan 1992).
Some researchers have found that willow seed can inhibit salt cedar germination, but
there are not enough willow seedlings versus salt cedar seedlings under natural
conditions. These same researchers also found that willow can invade salt cedar stands
given the proper release conditions from the dams. However, current release procedures
have produced increased selection against species with low adaptive abilities to vary the
proportion of root to shoot growth depending on environmental conditions (Stevens
1989).
According to Briggs and Munda (1992), salt cedar suppression appears possible with
close and uniform cottonwood pole plantings that allows the cottonwood to shade out the
salt cedar. They further observed that canopy closure could be expected in two years
following the initial pole plantings.
Accompanying the invasion of salt cedar in the low elevation riparian areas of the
southwestern U.S. is an apparent increase in the frequency of fire in these areas. Between
1981 and 1990, 166 individual fire incidents burned more than 11,800 ha (27%) of woody
riparian vegetation in the Lower Colorado River floodplain. This may be due to the
accumulation of highly resinous duff (partially decayed organic matter) under the salt
cedar plants. In a comparison of willow and salt cedar, the duff accumulation was greater
under salt cedar where a depth of up to 150 cm of material was found. The depth of
willow duff rarely accumulated to the point of exceeding one centimeter. Also, the soils
under salt cedar plants were found to be virtually hydrophobic (Stevens 1989).
Soil analyses indicated that concentrations of most nutrients increased following a fire,
but that alluvium salinity also increased. These changes may favor salt cedar at the
expense of native vegetation, and fires appear to have been infrequent in riparian
ecosystems prior to salt cedar invasion. Also, fire is currently uncommon in riparian
systems where salt cedar has not invaded. Salt cedar has been shown to resprout
profusely following fire, and this is one reason why it has been able to rapidly colonize
riparian areas. Efficient post-fire resprouting mechanisms appear to be lacking in willows
and cottonwoods (Busch and Smith 1993).
It may be possible for cottonwoods and willows, which can resprout from roots, to have
an advantage in terms of fire tolerance. Root sprouting is sometimes observed in
cottonwood and often in willows having a basal diameter greater than 20 cm (Briggs and
Munda 1992). Willows tend to survive fires better than cottonwoods according to these
authors and root sprouting may be the mechanism that allows them to do so. Stromberg
(1990) states that most riparian species recover from fire by resprouting, but he does not
specify whether from stumps or roots.
