Reimbursable Project
1995 - FINAL REPORT

Abstract:
Germination experiments were conducted on five genotypes of honey mesquite
(Prosopis juliflora), four genotypes of screwbean mesquite (Prosopis pubescens) and
27 genotypes of quailbush (Atriplex lentiformis). Rooting experiments were
conducted on ten cottonwood genotypes (Populus fremontii) and four willow
genotypes (Salix gooddingii). Five treatment levels were developed for the
germination and rooting experiments and consisted of the following salt
concentrations (NaCl): 0 mmhos cm-1 (control), 5 mmhos cm-1, 10 mmhos cm-1, 20
mmhos cm-1 and 40 mmhos cm-1. The objective of this project was to evaluate
various genotypes of these native shrub and tree species which are indigenous to the
Lower Colorado River and asses their performance at the five salt concentrations.
The focus of these experiments was to determine whether any of the genotypes in
each species group exhibited any tolerance to the saline conditions that might be
encountered along the Lower Colorado River.
KEY WORDS: honey mesquite, screwbean mesquite, quailbush, cottonwood,
willow, salt concentration, germination, biomass production, salt tolerance.
Introduction
Arizona has lost nearly 90% of its lowland riparian areas in the last 100 years according
to Pinkney (1992), regional riparian ecosystems along the Colorado River have been
reduced to less than 10% of their original area. This has spurred numerous studies and
revegetation attempts. Southwestern riparian ecosystems are particularly sensitive to
overuse because they are subjected to a wide variation in annual precipitation. They also
have a relatively simple species composition in comparison to more mesic riparian areas,
giving each species in the southwestern riparian areas a proportionately larger impact on
the whole ecosystem. Restoration of deteriorated riparian areas is often complex and
difficult (DeBano and Schmidt 1989; Brock 1984).
This report discusses the background of benefits and uses of riparian areas, factors
affecting these areas, current knowledge and methods that have been used for
revegetation, and factors influencing revegetation attempts. The purpose of this project
was to determine whether any genotypes of the species being evaluated exhibited any
tolerance to various saline conditions which may be encountered along the Lower
