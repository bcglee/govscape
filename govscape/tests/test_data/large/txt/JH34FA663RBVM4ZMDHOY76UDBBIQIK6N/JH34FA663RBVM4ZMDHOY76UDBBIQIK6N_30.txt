carboxylases and their associated enzymes in the same leaf of a C plant appears to result
4
in a higher attraction for more rapid uptake of CO . The close proximity of starch
2
formation to the vascular bundles should also make photosynthate translocation more
efficient (Waller and Lewis 1979).
Black (1971) explained that C plants exhibit continued increases in CO uptake
4 2
as light intensity increases to nearly full sunlight (approximately 1.5 to 1.8 langleys),
while C plants are saturated at 0.2 to 0.4 langleys. Maximum CO assimilation on a leaf
3 2
area basis at normal atmospheric concentrations of CO ranges from 50 to 80 mg CO
2 2
dm-2 hr-1 for C plants, but only 15 to 35 mg CO dm-2 hr-1 for C plants. Optimum
4 2 3
temperatures for CO uptake by C plants were reported to be between 30 and 40 ºC with
2 4
uptake decreasing rapidly below 15 to 20 ºC. In comparison with C plants, the optimum
3
temperatures ranged from 10 to 25 ºC with usually a sharp decrease in CO uptake at
2
temperatures above 25 ºC.
Björkman (1976) summarized that the function of the C photosynthetic pathway
4
is to concentrate CO in the bundle sheath cells, permitting the Calvin cycle to operate at
2
more favorable concentrations of this rate-limiting substrate. This provides a more
efficient mechanism for CO fixation at low CO concentrations in the intercellular
2 2
spaces than does the C photosynthetic pathway. Therefore, the advantage of the C4
3
photosynthetic pathway is maximized when photosynthesis is operating at high light
intensities and temperatures, and especially when stomatal conductance to gas exchange
is low. The C pathway is an important adaptive mechanism in hot and dry environments,
4
but it does not necessarily provide a significant adaptive advantage in cool, moist
environments (Björkman et al. 1974).
Gifford (1974) compared the carbon dioxide exchange rates (CER) between C
3
and C4 plants and reported that values for maximum CER in C grasses ranged from 53
4
to 64 µmol m-2 s-1. Similarly, Evans and Wardlaw (1976) reported rates for C cereals of
4
55 to 64 µmol m-2 s-1. Apparently the highest rate reported for any plant was
67 µmol m-2 s-1 in big galleta [Hilaria rigida (Thurb.) Benth.] which is a perennial C
4
species native to the deserts of the southwestern U.S.(Nobel 1980).
Water Use Efficiency
Two essential but opposing requirements are needed for plant growth. First the
plant requires rapid gas exchange with the atmosphere for the assimilation of CO and the
2
production of dry matter. However, maintenance of a high level of humidity within the
leaf requires minimal gas exchange with the atmosphere. By the same token, the
requirement for maximum absorption of solar radiation to operate the assimilation
process conflicts with the requirement not to increase the energy available for latent heat
exchange -- the heat source for plant water loss to the atmosphere (Stanhill 1986).
The quantity of water a plant requires for the production of a unit weight of dry
matter (exclusive of the roots) was termed its "water requirement" by Briggs and Shantz
(1914). The ratio between transpired water and the dry weight produced varies between
