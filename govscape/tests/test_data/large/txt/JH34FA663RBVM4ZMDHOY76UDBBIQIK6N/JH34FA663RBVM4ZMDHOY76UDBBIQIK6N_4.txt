phenology. These two collections were originally gathered from two sites which are
located very close to one another near Winona, Arizona.
Description:
Cowania mexicana is a many-branched, leafy, spreading, evergreen, native shrub. It
usually grows to a height of 1 to 3.5 meters. Under favorable conditions it can grow up to
7.5 meters in height. Benson and Darrow (1981) describe this species as having twigs
with some straight, spreading hairs, not wooly or wooly only around the leaf axils, with
stalked glands; bark reddish-brown; leaves all pinnately 3-5 parted into linear lobes, the
margins and upper surfaces with conspicuous, sticky, glandular dots; pecicels, floral
tubes, and calyces with stalked glands; petals 6-9 mm long, 4-6 mm broad; fruits with
tails (persistent styles) 3-5 cm long. Chromosome numbers are listed as 2n= 18 (Baker et
al. 1984).
The fruit is described as an achene with a persistant feathery style, borne in clusters of 4-
10 on a flat disk. The first and usually best crop of fruits (under natural conditions)
ripens from the middle of July through August. Fruits maturing from later flowers may
be dispersed from August through October. These late fruits are usually of poor quality
and are not worth harvesting (Young & Young 1992).
All three accessions which were selected from the 1983 Cowania IEP were collected from
areas in northern Arizona:
9018061: Collected by Dave Matthews on 06/01/80; southeast of Snowflake; Sec.28,
T12N, R23E.
9026143: Collected by Barry Wallace on 10/01/80; 0.75 mi. west of Winona on I-40; SW
of the NW 1/4 of Sec.14, T21N, R9E.
9016144: Collected by Barry Wallace on 10/01/80; Winona exit on I-40; NW of the SE
1/4 of Sec.14, T21N, R9E.
Discussion:
Cowania mexicana occurs naturally in the upper Mojavean and Arizona deserts, the
Desert Grassland, and the Southwestern Woodlands at 1,067 to 2,438 meters (3,500-
8,000 ft) in elevation. California in the Death Valley region and in the Clark and
Providence mountains in the Mojave desert; southern Nevada; southern and eastern Utah
from the Arches National Park southward; Arizona throughout the Colorado Plateau and
from the Hualapai Mountains, Mohave County, southeastward below the Mogollon Rim
to Santa Cruz and Cochise counties; New Mexico on the San Juan River drainage and
