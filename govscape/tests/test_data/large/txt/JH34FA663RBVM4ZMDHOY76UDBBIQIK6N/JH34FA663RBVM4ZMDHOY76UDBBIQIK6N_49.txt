Fig. 12: Water use efficiency (g g-1) of Ganada and P.I. 237110 yellow bluestem. Means
with different letters are significantly different at the 0.05 level.
The average amount of transpired water for each population over the 24-day
evaluation period was 3,179 g of water for P.I. 237110 and 1,794 g for Ganada. The
transpiration rates over a 72 hour period for each populationwere 42.8 mg cm-2 of leaf
area for P.I. 237110 and 29.9 mg cm-2 for Ganada (Fig. 13). Average daily water use was
also significantly different between these two varieties with P.I. 237110 showing a
