Discussion
Eriogonum wrightii can be found growing naturally at elevations from 760 to 2,195 m
(2,500-7,000 ft) on dry hills, valleys, and alluvial fans in the Arizona Desert, the Desert
Grassland, the Great Plains Grassland, and the Southwestern Woodland and Chaparral.
In southern Utah on the San Juan and Colorado river drainages; almost throughout
Arizona, except in the lower desert elevations; western and central New Mexico on the
San Juan, Gila, and Rio Grande drainages; TransPecos Texas and the Great Plains
Grassland; Baja California and Sonora to San Luis Potosi (Benson & Darrow 1981).
This species is highly important as both a browse plant for deer and livestock as well as a
bee plant for honey production (Benson & Darrow 1981)
To date the most efficient harvesting methods are either hand-harvesting or utilization of
the Shop-Vac vacuum cleaner. The best seed processing procedure has been to first work
the seed through the Westrup Brush Machine followed by using the Office Clipper (dual-
screen air separator).
Although no germination tests have been performed on the seed, germination rates during
the plant propagation process for the seed increase planting have been 75-90+%
germination within the first 24 hours from planting.
Conclusions:
This project has been discontinued. Because shrubby buckwheat is a cross-pollinated
species and the genetic base for this population has been derived from a single accession
which originally consisted of less than three individuals, TPMC personnel have
determined the genetic base for this population to be too narrow. This narrow genetic
base could very likely lead to establishment, production and performance problems in the
future. It should also be noted that from an economic standpoint, commercial seed
producers can harvest seed from natural stands more efficiently than producing seed in a
cultivated seed orchard.
