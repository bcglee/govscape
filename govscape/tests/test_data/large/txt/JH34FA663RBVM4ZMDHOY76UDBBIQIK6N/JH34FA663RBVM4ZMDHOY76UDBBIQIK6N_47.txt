Studies conducted with 13 cultivars of alkali sacaton that differed in stomate
density Cox et al. (1990) revealed transpiration rates ranging from 7 µg cm-2 s-1 up to 15
µg cm-2 s-1. However their data did not support reports by Dobrenz et al. (1969) and
Miskin et al. (1972) that grasses with fewer stomates had lower transpiration rates. This
was due to the fact that Cox et al. were limited in their ability to accurately measure
stomate densities because of the severely corrugated adaxial leaf surfaces, therefore only
abaxial stomate densities were presented. This prevented an accurate comparison with
the studies by Dobrenz et al. (1969) and Miskin et al. (1972) where stomate densities
were determined for both leaf surfaces.
Castonguay and Markhart (1992) stated that the coordination of gas exchange and
chloroplast activity are important for plant performance in water-limited environments.
Together they allow growth to proceed while minimizing dehydration. Stomatal closure
is a primary effect of moderate water stress and the observed decrease in photosynthetic
rates under moisture-limited conditions is often mainly due to a reduction in CO partial
2
pressure inside the leaf (Chaves 1991; Vassey et al. 1991).
Although no significant differences in photosynthetic rate were observed between
the two yellow bluestem populations, it appears that based on plant performance in terms
of total dry matter production alone, P.I. 237110 may better coordinate gas exchange and
