moisture requirement versus the vernal orientation of the streamside group. This
coincides with increased stream flow generated by upper elevation snowmelt, which
recharges water regimes along streams and rivers and acts in seed dispersal. The effect of
controlled stream flow on regeneration of seed can be viewed as detrimental.
Controlled stream flow through damming has been shown to affect riparian soil quality
by coarsening soil texture, leaching nutrients, hydraulic and eolian erosion, desiccation,
and the non-renewal of sediment deposits. It also increases pH levels (Stevens 1989).
Clonal species colonize sand beaches more rapidly than species that reproduced primarily
by seed. The reduction of seasonal flooding resulting from dam construction and
controlled stream flow has reduced clonal species colonization. This decreases the
overall genetic diversity of a clonal community, since clones are genetically identical to
the parent plant, while seedlings are not. Seedling density was significantly greater in
relatively rare deposits of silt as compared to sand or other substrates (Stevens 1989).
According to Brock (1984), riparian forests are considered by many to be relics of pluvial
periods in the Southwest when glaciation was active in the northern latitudes. He
describes four stages of gallery forest formation: 1) seedling nursery-bar stands, 2)
adolescent nursery-bar stands, 3) sub-mature stands, and 4) mature stands. Seedling
establishment in raw recent deposits (usually silt) either in the main channel or in the
overflow side channels. As seedlings develop towards adolescence, debris and sediments
allow building of stands during light or moderate floods. This process successively
builds the soil and raises the soil surface which increases the resistance of the tree stands
to flood damage. This process results in the true riparian community occurring on
slightly raised terraces. The nursery area may emerge over time and appear to be a single
stand of mature trees.
Reichenbacher (1984) presents a slightly different point of view. He states that channel
migration and sediment deposition from the stream are what allows the growth to reach
maturity. From this point of view, the concave banks that have established vegetation are
gradually undercut by the stream, and sediment is deposited on convex banks. Since the
sediment is usually silt, which is the preferred germination medium for Salix and
Populus, and if there is no blockage of light by the overstory, the conditions for
germination of the seed are good. Also, Salix is not as highly tolerant of flooding as are
many swamp trees, indicating that growth to maturity is only possible when lateral
migration of the stream leaves the trees well above the level of prolonged submergence.
Elevation may be a significant factor in analysis for all community types if riparian
vegetation. For example, according to Szaro (1990), Goodding willows form almost pure
stands on lower elevation sites (546 ± 76m) along the lower Colorado and Gila rivers,
codominates with Fremont cottonwood at the mid-elevation sites (1,036 ± 171m) and is
only a minor component at higher elevation cottonwood sites (1,264 ± 162m) in the
Southwest. Stream gradient and direction are also important, but at a more limited and
local level. Brock (1984) slightly contradicts this observation by stating that the
