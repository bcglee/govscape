Soil samples were collected from each of the harvest sites for the mesquite genotypes.
These samples were then evaluated for texture, pH and salinity. This information was
used to determine whether genotypes collected from highly saline sites would exhibit
significantly higher germination percentages at higher salt concentrations than genotypes
collected from non- or low-saline sites.
Germination experiments were conducted on five genotypes of honey mesquite, four
genotypes of screwbean mesquite and 27 genotypes of quailbush. Rooting experiments
were conducted on ten cottonwood genotypes and four willow genotypes. The five
treatment levels developed for the germination and rooting experiments consisted of the
following salt concentrations (NaCl): 0 mmhos cm-1 (control), 5 mmhos cm-1, 10 mmhos
cm-1, 20 mmhos cm-1 and 40 mmhos cm-1.
Mean germination percentage for all quailbush genotypes in the control treatment was
75%. Mean germination percentages for quailbush in the other four treatments were:
70% at 5 mmhos cm-1, 54% at 10 mmhos cm-1, 19% at 20 mmhos cm-1 and 1% at 40
mmhos cm-1. As expected, mean germination percentages declined with increasing salt
concentrations. None of the quailbush genotypes exhibited a consistently higher mean
germination percentage than any of the other genotypes over all of the salt concentration
levels.
Mean germination percentage for all honey mesquite genotypes in the control treatment
was 83%. Mean germination percentage in the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment was slightly
higher, 84.6%, but not significantly so. Mean germination percentages for the honey
mesquite genotypes in the other three treatments were: 78% at 10 mmhos cm-1, 57% at 20
mmhos cm-1 and 6% at 40 mmhos cm-1. Again, as salt concentrations increased, mean
germination percentages decreased. This decrease was significantly greater in the 20 and
40 mmhos cm-1 treatments than at the control, 5 and 10 mmhos cm-1 treatments. None of
the honey mesquite genotypes exhibited a consistently higher mean germination
percentage than any of the other genotypes across all salt concentration levels.
Germination experiments conducted on screwbean mesquite genotypes revealed that
mean germination percentages decreased as salt concentrations increased. This decrease
was significantly greater in the 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1 treatments in comparison with the
control, 5 and 10 mmhos cm-1 treatments. Mean germination percentage for all screwbean
mesquite genotypes in the control treatment was 29%. Mean germination percentages for
all screwbean mesquite genotypes in the other four treatments were: 27% at 5 mmhos
cm-1, 24% at 10 mmhos cm-1, 16% at 20 mmhos cm-1 and 4% at 40 mmhos cm-1. None of
the screwbean mesquite genotypes exhibited a consistently higher mean germination
percentage than any other genotypes across all salt concentration levels.
Soil salinity data from samples taken at each collection site was not correlated to the
observed germination percentages in either the honey or screwbean mesquite
experiments.
