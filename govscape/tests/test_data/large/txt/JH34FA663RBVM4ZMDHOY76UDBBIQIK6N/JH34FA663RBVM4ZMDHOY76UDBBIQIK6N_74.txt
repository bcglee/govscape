10 minutes (1 part bleach:9 parts distilled water) followed by a thorough rinsing with
distilled water. The seed was then dried in an oven for 60 minutes at 64 °C.
In preparation, clear, plastic petri dishes, 100 X 15 mm, were clearly labeled (genotype,
salt concentration treatment, date) and lined with Whatman No. 1 filter paper (bottom
only). Each petri dish represented a given genotype and treatment level. Five hundred
seeds from each genotype were separated into five packets, resulting in 100 seeds per
packet. Each packet was emptied into its respective dish (treatment level). Each dish
was then wetted with either the control solution or one of the four salt concentration
solutions. A sufficient amount of solution was applied to each petri dish as to thoroughly
wet the seed. Excess solution was drained from each dish.
Each group of five petri dishes per genotype were then placed into Ziploc plastic bags
along with a moist sponge to maintain humidity. The collective bags were then placed
into the germinator. The temperature settings for the mesquite experiment in the
germinator were set at 12 hours at 30 °C/12 hours at 25 °C. The light bank was not
turned on in order to minimize fungal growth. Germination data was collected each
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings. A seed was considered to have germinated
and was removed from the dish when the radicle was ≥2mm in length. Seeds that
developed fungal growth were removed and considered nonviable.
Rooting experiments were conducted with ten cottonwood genotypes and four willow
genotypes (Table 3). Again, five salt concentration levels were used for these
experiments: 0 mmhos cm-1 (Control), 5 mmhos cm-1, 10 mmhos cm-1, 20 mmhos cm-1 and
40 mmhos cm-1 NaCl. The genotypes for the rooting experiments were initially harvested
as pole cuttings from various locations along the Lower Colorado River. The pole
cuttings were harvested during April and May of 1993. The poles were transported to the
Tucson PMC and planted into Field 6 where they were flood irrigated on a regular basis
to ensure optimum growth.
The rooting experiments were initiated on February 17, 1995. Five Rubbermaid, 68.2
liter containers were set up for this experiment, one container per treatment. At the onset
of each replication, pole cuttings were harvested from the trees in Field 6 and brought
into the Tucson PMC laboratory. Four containers were filled with 37.85 liters of salt
concentration solution and one container received 37.85 liters of distilled water (Control).
Three cuttings from each genotype were clearly labeled and banded loosely together. The
lids for the Rubbermaid containers had 4.45 cm diameter holes cut into them for each
group of three cuttings. After all groups of poles had been placed into each container
with the lids firmly attached, the openings were then sealed with cotton to prevent light
from entering the containers as well as to reduce evaporation. An aerator was also placed
into each container to prevent stagnation and to keep oxygen levels within the solutions at
optimum levels.
