significantly higher water use than Ganada (Fig. 14). This may be due to P.I. 237110's
increased leaf area and higher total dry matter production. McGinnies and Arnold (1939)
stated that for any given species, the WUE will vary more or less with changes in external
factors, and that a plant should have the lowest WUE under optimum growing conditions.
If this is true, it should follow that a comparatively low WUE for a given species should
indicate an approach toward optimum growth conditions, while a relatively high WUE
would indicate less favorable conditions. A single determination of the WUE of a species
considered by itself is no indication of the adaptability of that species to the environment.
Furthermore, while a single WUE determination may not indicate the adaptability of a
species to various environments, a series of
