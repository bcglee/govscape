1995 - FINAL REPORT
by
Mark Pater
'STEVAN' PLAINS BRISTLEGRASS [Setaria leucopila (Scribn. & Merrill) K. Schum.]
(Reg. no. CV-173, P.I. 552568) was released by the USDA-SCS, USDA-ARS, and the
University of Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station April 1, 1994. The cultivar will
be used as an erosion control plant in southeastern Arizona, southwestern and
southeastern New Mexico, and western Texas.
Stevan plains bristlegrass is an apomictic, C, native, perennial, warm-season bunchgrass
4
(Emery 1957).
Stevan is the product of a testing program to develop a superior population of plains
bristlegrass that was conducted at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (TPMC). Stevan
plains bristlegrass is a population of 13 accessions that were selected from an initial
evaluation study conducted at the TPMC from 1975 through 1979. Open-pollinated seed
produced in 1979 from these accessions was bulked to form Stevan. Stevan was included
in plantings on the Santa Rita Experimental Range from 1982 through 1986 (Briggs 1982,
Munda and Pater 1989). The Stevan population exhibited good germination and
establishment in years having normal amounts of precipitation (200-300 mm yr-1). In
1993 Stevan was included in a planting in Avra Valley, Arizona. The purpose of this
planting was to evaluate seedling emergence and establishment from planting depths of
1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 cm. Stevan exhibited a higher seedling emergence percentage and
average number of seedlings per 0.3 m at the 3.75 cm planting depth. However, this was
not significantly higher (P<0.05) than emergence and establishment from the 1.25 and 2.5
cm planting depths. Stevan exhibited significantly higher emergence percentage (P<0.05)
over a commercially available population of plains bristlegrass.
Stevan was selected primarily for use in revegetation of eroded rangelands, retired
croplands, critical areas (i.e. highway construction sites), and to provide a degree of
forage for wildlife and livestock use. In arid climates soil surface moisture is a limiting
factor in germination and seedling establishment. Stevan plains bristlegrass is an
excellent candidate for revegetation use because of its ability to emerge and establish
from greater seeding depths than many other grass species. It is recommended that
Stevan be utilized as part of a seeding mixture comprising roughly 20-30% of the total
mix. However, the percent composition can vary depending on the seeding objective.
Seed propagation of Stevan is restricted to two generations of increase from breeder seed,
and one each of foundation and certified. Breeder and foundation seed will be maintained
by the USDA-SCS, Tucson Plant Materials Center, 3241 N. Romero Rd., Tucson, AZ
85705. Limited quantities of foundation seed will be available for commercial
production in 1994.
