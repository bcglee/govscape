1990 COWANIA MEXICANA ADVANCED EVALUATION
(Project Number: 04A9002H)
1995 - FINAL REPORT

Abstract:
In 1983, the Cowania mexicana initial evaluation planting (IEP) was installed
at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (TPMC) to evaluate the potential of
this species for use as a component in seed mixes for various revegetation
projects as well as its potential use as a low water use landscape plant. Three
accessions were selected in 1989 out of this IEP for further evaluations.
However, due to a limited genetic base for this developed cliffrose
population, the project has been removed from the TPMC evaluation
process.
KEY WORDS: Cowania mexicana, cliffrose, drought resistant, actinorhizal,
germination.
Introduction:
The cliffrose (Cowania mexicana D. Don var. stansburiana [Torr.] Jeps.) advanced
evaluation project originally began with the 1983 Cowania mexicana IEP. This IEP was
initiated to evaluate this species' potential use as a component in seeding mixes for use in
reseeding depleted range sites, critical areas, mine reclamation sites as well as provide
improved wildlife habitat and winter forage for areas located in Major Land Resource
Areas (MLRA) 29, 35, 39, 40 and 41. The shrubs in the IEP were evaluated for
emergence, survival, vigor, height and width, and flowering periods. Each accession was
evaluated individually in the process of trying to determine which ones were the superior
performers.
Three accessions of Cowania mexicana were selected in 1989 for advanced evaluation.
These accessions were: 9018061, 9026143 and 9026144. Accessions 9026143 and
9026144 were selected for their very good vigor, a nicely rounded growth form (desirable
landscape characteristic), longer flowering period and superior seed production.
Collection 9018061 demonstrated long leader growth and more desirable ground cover
characteristics: lower branches spread laterally over the ground. This collection also
flowers 4-6 weeks earlier than the other accessions and the flower set is very dense and
uniform over the whole plant.
In 1991, accessions 9026143 and 9026144 were combined into a single lot and assigned
accession number 9058832. Both accessions are very similar in appearance and
