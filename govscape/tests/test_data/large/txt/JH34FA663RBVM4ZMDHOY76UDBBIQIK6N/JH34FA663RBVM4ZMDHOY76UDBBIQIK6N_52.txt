can pick up the CO because it is high in concentration, and RuBP carboxylase can work

efficiently.
The difference in stomate densities between the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces
of P.I. 237110 can also be seen. Stomates are found on virtually all green parts of a plant,
especially the leaves and culms. On the leaves, they are typically more abundant on the
abaxial surface. Grasses typically have dumbbell-shaped guard cells. This results from
the fact that the elongated guard cells are thin walled on the ends and have thick walls
along the middle. As the cells absorb water the ends swell but the middle remains
narrow. The middle regions of the two guard cells are pushed apart by the enlarged ends,
opening the stomatal pore. When the guard cells lose water, the ends shrink and the mid
regions move together, and the pore is then closed. The dumbbell shape is present only
when the guard cells are turgid (Mauseth 1988).
