1992 Evaluations
In 1992 all of the collection sites for the accessions assembled for this evaluation were to
be plotted on a map in order to determine the range of collection within the species’
natural range of adaptation. This map was to aid in the development of a genetically
broad-based population.
For the CDI selection method to be employed, live plants from the original IEP planting
were to be used for the initial composite planting (CO). Three plants from each of the 80
accessions in the IEP were to be placed in square planting configuration using a
completely randomized block design. Prior to transplanting, the IEP block was to be
mowed to a 6-8” height and irrigated. The individual plants in the CO block were to be
planted on a 3x3 foot spacing. The CO planting was to be flood irrigated and managed to
ensure optimal seed production.
At harvest, equal amounts of seed were to be harvested from all plants and bulked. Plants
from this seed were to be propagated at the Tucson PMC and groups of 160 plants were
to be planted out in 10x16 square-configured grids at off-center locations within the
species’ natural range of adaptation. A minimum combined total of 100 live plants
selected from each off-center location were to be returned to the Tucson PMC where a
new composite planting would be formed for the next cycle of the selection process. If
Tucson PMC personnel were to decide that the selections to date were sufficient, the new
composite planting would serve as a breeder’s block.
If a modified mass selection technique was to be utilized, live plants from the IEP
planting would be used to form the initial mass selection composite planting (MA).
Three plants from each of the 80 original accessions in the IEP planting were to be
planted into a square planting configuration using a completely randomized block design.
This would have resulted in a total of 240 plants being installed into the MA planting.
Prior to transplanting, the IEP block was to be mowed to a 6-8” height and irrigated. The
individual plants in the MA planting were to be planted on a 3x3 foot spacing. The MA
planting was to be flood irrigated and managed to ensure optimum seed production. At
harvest, seed from the MA planting was to be bulked and equal amounts would be
planted at various off-center sites located within the species’ natural range of adaptation.
Off-center evaluations would primarily focus on emergence and seedling establishment.
Following adequate off-center evaluations the MA block could be designated as a
breeder’s block.
None of these procedures were completed and the project has been discontinued. Tucson
PMC personnel feel that Sporobolus flexuosus is an excellent candidate to be included in
the PMC evaluation program. This species has excellent potential for future use as a soil
stabilizing plant in southeastern Arizona.
