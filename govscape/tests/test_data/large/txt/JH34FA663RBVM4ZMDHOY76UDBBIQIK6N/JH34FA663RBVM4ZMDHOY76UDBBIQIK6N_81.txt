Results of the DRI experiments on willow are summarized as follows: Shoot and root
biiomass responses indicate that Salix is intolerant of salinity in concentrations greater
than 2.34 mmhos cm-1. However, after 60 days shoot length responses in the control and
9.38 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels were similar, but the 9.38 mmhos cm-1 had 80%
mortality during this time (Jackson et al.. 1990).
Cottonwood - Willow Comparisons:
In comparison, mean leaf biomass production for all cottonwood and willow genotypes at
the control treatment level revealed no significant differences. However, mean root
biomass production for all genotypes at the control level revealed two willow genotypes
as producing significantly greater mean amounts of root biomass. Genotype W-5
produced a mean of 190 mg and genotype W-10 produced a mean of 170 mg.
At the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level one cottonwood genotype produced a significantly
greater mean leaf biomass (C-4 704 mg) than the majority of all other genotypes.
However, mean root biomass production at the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level revealed
one willow genotype to have produced a significantly higher mean amount of root
material (W-1 130 mg) over the majority of all other genotypes in comparison.
No significant differences were revealed between any of the genotypes in terms of mean
leaf biomass production at the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level. Mean root biomass
production at this treatment level decreased to a large degree. Genotype W-1 produced a
mean root biomass amount of 29.3 mg but this was not significantly different in
comparison with the majority of all other genotypes.
Mean leaf biomass production at the 20 mmhos cm-1 treatment level revealed genotype
W-4 (69.3 mg) to be significantly higher than the majority of all other genotypes in
comparison. Mean root biomass production for all cottonwood and willow genotypes at
this treatment level revealed genotypes W-1 (5 mg) and W-5 (3.3 mg) to have produced
higher mean amounts of root biomass than all other genotypes in comparison. However,
these are not significantly different from all other genotypes in comparison which
produced no measurable amounts of root biomass.
Summary
The objective of this project was to evaluate various genotypes of five native shrub and
tree species collected from along the Lower Colorado River and asses their performance
at five salt concentrations. The primary goal of these experiments was to determine
whether any of the genotypes in each species group exhibit any tolerance to the saline
conditions that might be encountered along the Lower Colorado River. Species examined
in this project included quailbush (Atriplex lentiformis), honey mesquite (Prosopis
juliflora), screwbean mesquite (Prosopis pubescens), cottonwood (Populus fremontii)
and willow (Salix gooddingii).
