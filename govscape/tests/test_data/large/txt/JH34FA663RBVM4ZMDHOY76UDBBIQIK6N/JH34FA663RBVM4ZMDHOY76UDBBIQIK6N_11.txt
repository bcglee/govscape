For statistical purposes, the assembly utilized a randomized complete block design with
four replications per accession. Each accession was replicated four times with five plants
per accession per replication. The IEP plot encompassed all of Borders 13 and 14 (0.56
acres). Guard rows of Bouteloua curtipendula and Bouteloua gracilis were planted along
the outside rows to reduce edge effects. All plants were irrigated to ensure establishment.
Evaluation data was to be collected quarterly and summarized in the yearly TPMC
Technical Report.
In 1992 TPMC personnel decided to improve the selection process for this assembly by
reestablishing this IEP using a Convergent-Divergent Improvement (CDI) process. A
procedure for cross-pollinated plants as outlined by Lonnquist et al. (1979) was to be
followed. This procedure is based on a system involving the collection of separate units
of germplasm (accessions) from a broad area within the species’ natural range of
adaptation. This is then followed by bulking of seed and then dispersal (divergence) to a
set of evaluation sites located within the species’ natural range of adaptation. Following
equal intensity mass selection at each evaluation site, samples of the harvested seed will
be returned (convergence) to the Tucson PMC for intermating prior to divergence to the
set planting sites for continued selection.
If it is determined that Sporobolus flexuosus is a self-pollinated species, a mass selection
procedure will be used to develop a population with a broad genetic base. Following
mass selection and bulking of seed at the Tucson PMC, equal amounts of the bulked
material will be planted at various off-center evaluation sites located within the species’
natural range of adaptation. As with the convergent-divergent system, equal intensity
mass selection will be conducted at each evaluation site and the harvested seed will be
returned to the Tucson PMC to form a breeder’s block.
Results and Discussion:
1990 Evaluations
Evaluation data for 1990 was summarized in the 1991 TPMC Technical Report2. Five
accessions appeared to be superior based on above average vigor and production. These
were: 9027977, 9029731, 9023304, 9029731 and 9055828
1991 Evaluations
Evaluation data for 1991 was marginal. Seven accessions were shown to be superior in
vigor however nine other accessions were shown to be superior in terms of % survival
((cid:1)90%).
