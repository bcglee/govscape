1989 SPOROBOLUS FLEXUOSUS
(Project Number: 04I021l)
1995 - FINAL REPORT

Mark Pater
Abstract:
In 1989, 80 accessions of Sporobolus flexuosus (mesa dropseed) were installed
at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (TPMC) to evaluate the potential of
this species for use as a component in revegetation projects in southeastern
Arizona. This project failed in the initial evaluation planting (IEP) phase of
the evaluation process. Tucson PMC personnel still feel that this species
merits continued evaluations.
KEY WORDS: Sporobolus flexuosus, mesa dropseed, native.
Introduction:
This IEP consisted of 80 accessions. Sporobolus flexuosus is a native, perennial, warm-
season bunchgrass. It is found on dry or moist, open, sandy or gravelly soils, mostly at
2,500 - 5,500 feet in elevation. Sporobolus flexuosus was being evaluated for its potential
use in rangeland erosion control, providing vegetative cover on abandoned cropland and
other large areas where the vegetation has been disturbed or removed, as well as to
provide vegetative diversity in these problem areas. Its natural adaptive range includes
MLRA's 30, 35, 39, 40 and 41. Each accession was evaluated for emergence, survival,
vigor, foliage and seed production.
Objectives:
The objective of this IEP was to assemble, evaluate, develop and cooperatively release a
superior ecotype of Sporobolus flexuosus for use in range improvement and critical area
stabilization.
Procedure:
The assembly for the 1989 Sporobolus flexuosus IEP was completed in November 1988.
In February 1989, seed from each accession was planted into 1.5" x 8" conetainers with a
1:1:1 mixture of peat moss, vermiculite, perlite and sand. After sufficient seedling growth
(90-120 days) the plants were placed in the lathhouse for a hardening off period prior to
transplanting into the field.
The plants for this IEP were planted by hand into Field 4, Borders 13 and 14 at the
Tucson PMC. The soils are Comoro fine sandy loam. Prior to planting, the border was
rotovated, harrowed, cultipacked and pre-irrigated.
