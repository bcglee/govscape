Following a 28-day observation period, all root and green leaf and stem tissue from each
pole was stripped from the cuttings. The individual root samples from each genotype was
placed in labeled envelopes. These samples were then dried in a laboratory oven for 24
hours at 60 Â°C and weighed. The dry weight for each observation was recorded and
statistical comparisons made on the amount of biomass produced between genotype and
treatments.
Results and Discussion
Experiments evaluating salt tolerance levels pertaining to the species in our experiments
have also been performed by the Desert Research Institute (DRI) at the University of
Nevada (Jackson et al. 1990). Researchers at DRI set up their experiments using the
following salt concentration levels: 0 mg l-1 (Control), 1,500 mg l-1 (2.34 mmhos cm-1),
6,000 mg l-1 (9.38 mmhos cm-1 ), 18,000 mg l-1 (28.13 mmhos cm-1 ), 36,000 mg l-1 (56.25
mmhos cm-1 ) and 60,000 mg l-1 (93.75 mmhos cm-1 ). Summaries of their results follow
the results of each species in the Tucson PMC experiments.
Germination Experiments - Quailbush Genotypes:
Mean germination at the control level was significantly higher than at the other four
treatment levels. The mean germination percentage for all quailbush genotypes at the
control level was 75% versus 70.1% at 5 mmhos cm-1, 54.1% at 10 mmhos cm-1, 19% at
20 mmhos cm-1, and 0.9% at 40 mmhos cm-1.
Twenty-four genotypes exhibited mean germination percentages greater than 50% at the
control level. Twenty-three genotypes exhibited mean germination percentages greater
than 50% at the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level. At the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, 16
genotypes exhibited mean germination percentages greater than 50%. Mean germination
percentages at the 20 mmhos cm-1 treatment level showed a marked decrease with only 2
genotypes having greater than 40% germination. At the 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment level,
only one genotype exhibited a significantly higher mean germination percentage than the
other 26. However, the mean germination percentage for this genotype was only 10.2%.
In summary, the results of this experiment showed that the 27 quailbush genotypes
germinated best (>50%) at salt concentrations up to 10 mmhos cm-1. Mean germination
percentages dropped off drastically at the 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels (19%
and 0.9% respectively).
Results of the DRI experiments on quailbush are summarized as follows: Quailbush can
grow under a range of salt concentration levels but growth responses were noticeably
decreased at the 56.25 and 93.75 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels. Germination results
revealed germination only to occur in the three lowest salt concentration treatment levels,
and less than 25% germination at each level (Jackson et al. 1990).
