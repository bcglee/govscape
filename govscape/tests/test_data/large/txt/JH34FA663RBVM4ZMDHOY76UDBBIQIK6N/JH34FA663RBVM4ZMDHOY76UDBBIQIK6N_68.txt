tolerance is amenable to breeding (Abel 1969; Newman and Antcliff 1984). Allen et al.
(1994) report that no significant progress in the identification of major genes controlling
salt tolerance has been made for forest tree species, however the authors concluded that
the most probable and immediate improvement in salt tolerance in trees can be
accomplished through intensive screening and selection, specifically in cases where large
numbers of individuals have been exposed to saline conditions.
Allocational Plasticity:
Seedlings of species exhibiting strong allocational plasticity (e.g. Tamarix, Salix exigua,
Baccharis sarthroides, B. salicifolia, Tessaria and Phragmites australis) were
significantly more common than species that were less capable of altering allocation
between roots and above-ground growth (e.g. Populus fremontii, Salix gooddingii,
Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Prosopis glandulosa). Relative allocation to roots in all
species decreased as limiting nutrient availability increased, but the degree of this varied.
Selection against species with low phenotypic plasticity has increased whereas clonal and
phenotypically plastic species have a selective advantage (Stevens 1989).
The preferential allocation of resources to shoots or roots appears to be an adaptive
response to soil condition changes. Since the soils of the pre-dam era were generally
much higher in fertility than the post-dam soils, allocational plasticity was not as crucial
before the river was dammed (Stevens 1989).
An example of change in soils tested by Stevens (1989) along the Colorado river in the
Grand Canyon, showed the pre-dam amounts of K+, Mg2+ and Ca 2+ as 213.7, 229.6 and
1,695.0 µg/g respectively, while post-dam amounts were 19.3, 75.7 and 666.7 µg/g
respectively. In addition, the pre-dam soil had a total base cation level of 18.5 and 3.7
µg/g for NO and PO respectively, while the post-dam amounts were 7.2 and 2.7 µg/g
3- 4-
respectively. Another significant change was noted in the percentages of sand and silt.
Pre-dam sand content was 89% and silt+clay was 11%. Post-dam sand content was 97%
and silt+clay was noted as being three percent. This change in texture influences
infiltration rates and nutrient levels as well as water holding capacities.
Stevens (1989) stated that seedling density is significantly greater in the relatively rare silt
deposits, compared to sand or other substrates. He also noted that seedling germination,
growth and survival were limited by moisture and nutrient availability, and moisture
interactions with substrate particle size.
