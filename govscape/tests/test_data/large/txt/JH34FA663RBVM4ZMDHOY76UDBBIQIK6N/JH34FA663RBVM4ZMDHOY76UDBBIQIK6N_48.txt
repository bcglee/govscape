photosynthesis resulting in increased plant growth over Ganada. Although no leaf
temperature data were collected, Ganada may transpire more in order to maintain cooler
leaf temperatures. P.I. 237110 may also have the ability to direct more resources into
tissue growth and production if it is able to withstand higher leaf temperatures.
Dark Respiration
Dark respiration rate measurements in the lab showed no significant differences
between the two varieties (P.I. 237110, 1.9 µmol m-2 s-1 and Ganada, 1.4 µmol m-2 s-1 )
(Fig. 11). Baker et al. (1985) stated that estimates of the proportion of the dark
respiration that is inhibited by light suggest that large fluctuations in the ability of light to
inhibit respiratory activity occur during leaf development. The high cytosolic ATP/ADP
ratio that is generated by photosynthetic activity of the thylakoids when a leaf is exposed
to light is thought to inhibit mitochondrial respiratory activity.
Water Use Efficiency
The calculated WUE rates for each population were 89 g of water required to
produce 1 gram of dry matter for P.I. 237110 and 52 g for Ganada (Fig. 12). In the study
conducted by Wright and Dobrenz (1973), the calculated WUE rates for the six lines of
Lehmann's lovegrass ranged from 135 to 178 units of water required to produce one unit
of dry matter. The lower WUE rates in the experiments with the yellow bluestem
populations may be due to the use of smaller pots; 0.8-L pots for the yellow bluestem
versus 4.2-L pots for the Lehmann's lovegrass experiments. The smaller pots may have
restricted root growth in the yellow bluestem plants as well as reduce the amount of water
for transpiration. This reduction in the amount of available water may have lowered the
rate of transpiration in the yellow bluestem plants which in turn may have reduced the
WUE values.
