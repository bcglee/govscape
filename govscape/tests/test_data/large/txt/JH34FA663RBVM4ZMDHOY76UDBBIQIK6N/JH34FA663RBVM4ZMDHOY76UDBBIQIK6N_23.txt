pasture grasses (Dewald et al. 1988). Since the introduction of yellow bluestem, several
varieties have been extensively tested, developed and made commercially available for
pasture and conservation uses.
U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) personnel at the Tucson Plant
Materials Center (TPMC) began evaluating yellow bluestem in the mid-1970's for its
potential use in reseeding degraded rangelands, retired farmlands, critical areas, and as a
warm-season, irrigated pasture species (Pater 1992). In light of the growing concern for
the use of native species for reseeding rangeland, the focus for yellow bluestem shifted
primarily towards its use as a low water use, irrigated pasture grass, as well as for
reseeding retired farmland, highway construction sites, critical areas and mine spoils.
Currently, one of the best adapted, commercially available cultivars of yellow bluestem
for use in Arizona is 'Ganada'. This cultivar was originally collected in Turkestan in
1934, and released for commercial production from the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center,
New Mexico in 1979 (Anonymous 1979).
An evaluation of 13 Old World yellow bluestem accessions was initiated at the
TPMC in September of 1983. Evaluation criteria included vigor, size, yield, and
tolerance to drought and cold in mature, single plants. One accession, P.I. 237110,
quickly proved to be the superior performer in vigor, biomass production, spring green-
up, and tolerance to drought-like conditions.
P.I. 237110 was originally collected from the Al Khars region in Saudi Arabia in
the spring of 1952. It was first selected as the superior performer in the 1975 Critical
Area and Range Improvement Grass Initial Evaluation Planting at the TPMC in 1979.
P.I. 237110 was also evaluated in revegetation trials on abandoned cropland southwest of
Tucson from 1987-1989. In comparison with a variety of native and introduced grass
species, P.I. 237110 was one of the few perennial bunchgrass species to become
effectively established (Munda and Pater. 1989).
The superior performance of P.I. 237110 over the commercially available Ganada,
suggested that P.I. 237110 was better adapted to the southwestern desert climate. The
objective of this experiment was to determine what physiological or morphological
differences might explain the large differences in performance between Ganada and P.I.
237110. The objectives of this study were achieved by comparing the variation in
stomate densities on both surfaces of leaf blades as well as the leaf sheath, and evaluating
specific leaf weights, apparent photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate, and water use
efficiency (WUE) of Ganada and P.I. 237110.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Leaf Anatomy
Gould and Shaw (1983) describe the leaf of a grass plant as consisting of a basal
sheath, which tightly enfolds the culm, and a flattened blade or lamina. A membranous
or hairy ligule is commonly present on the adaxial surface at the apex of the sheath.
Projections of tissue called auricles may be developed laterally at the apex of the sheath
or at the base of the blade. Both the sheath and the blade conduct the normal leaf
