P.I. 330683 arrived at the Tucson PMC, from Israel through the National Plant Materials
Center (Beltsville, MD) on January 29, 1977. Literature searches at the National
Agricultural Library and the University of Arizona Science Library did not reveal much
information on Karoograss. This species is found growing primarily in South Africa at
intermediate elevations within annual precipitation zones of 381 to 635 mm (15-25
inches). P.I. 330683 had shown itself to be drought resistant in the 1977 Warm- and
Cool-Season Grass IEP. It was also noted to have maintained excellent to fair vigor from
1977-1981 and had produced a good amount of forage. This accession was very
comparable to P.I. 354922, also from Israel. However, P.I. 330683 produced more forage
in both spring and summer clipping evaluations.4 Complete 1981 data for all Tetrachne
dregei accessions is shown in Table 1.
Status:
From 1982 until 1993, this species was not evaluated extensively. In June, 1993 a seed
increase block was installed in Field 4, Border 15. This accession was noted to exhibit a
slightly stoloniferous growth habit. It was also noted that this accession did not go fully
dormant during the winter months and that it began to green up in the late winter period.
These observations led TPMC personnel to believe that this species may tend to
outcompete and dominate off-center planting sites by making use of available soil
moisture and nutrients before the indigenous species began their growing cycle. These
observations along with a lack of demand by customers for non-native grass species
helped TPMC personnel to decide to drop this species from the TPMC testing program.
It should be noted that this accession may show promise for use as an irrigated pasture
grass.
