aestivum L.) Martin and Kiyomoto (1992) stated that biomass (Aase 1978) and canopy
production (Puckridge 1971) are highly correlated with leaf area. Genotypic differences
in flag leaf area and duration have also been correlated with differences in yield in winter
wheat (Fischer et al. 1981; Rawson et al. 1983).
Apparent Photosynthesis
When apparent photosynthesis was measured in the field at the TPMC, no
significant differences were observed between Ganada (12µmol m-2 s-1) and P.I. 237110
(10 µmol m-2 s-1) (Fig. 9). When measuring apparent photosynthetic rates in the lab, there
was also no significant difference between these two populations, Ganada exhibited a rate
of 3.3 µmol m-2 s-1 and P.I. 237110 showed a rate of 3.1 µmol m-2 s-1 (Fig. 10).
Lower photosynthetic rates were measured in the lab than in the field because in
the field a single leaf was measured under full sunlight. In the lab we measured apparent
photosynthetic rates of a whole plant under a light bank that produced 2000 µEin m-2 s-1
at the top of the plant canopy and 500 µEin m-2 s-1 at the base of the plant due to shading
from the plant canopy.
The lower rates in the lab may also have been the result of lower overall light intensity
due to fluorescent lighting and lower air temperature as compared to the full sunlight
intensity and outside air temperature when the photosynthetic rate samples were taken at
the TPMC. No data were taken on light intensity and air temperature in the lab.
