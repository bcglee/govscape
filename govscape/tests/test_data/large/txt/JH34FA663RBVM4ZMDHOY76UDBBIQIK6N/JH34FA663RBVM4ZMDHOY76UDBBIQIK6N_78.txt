significantly different from either the genotype with the highest or lowest mean percent
germination.
The mean germination percentage for all genotypes at the control level was 29.4%.
Similar differences were also exhibited by the same genotypes at the 5 mmhos cm-1
treatment level. The mean germination percentage for all genotypes at this treatment
level was 27.1%. Genotype SB 994-1 again exhibited the highest mean percent
germination, 37.4%, which was only significantly different from genotype SB 894-1 with
17% germination.
At the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, the mean germination percentage for all genotypes
was 24.2%. Genotypes SB 894-2 and SB 994-1 exhibited significantly higher mean
germination percentages, 32.8% for both, versus genotypes SB 894-3 at 16.6% and
SB 894-1 at 14.4%. At the 20 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, genotype SB 894-2 exhibited
a significantly higher mean germination percentage at 28.4% versus 10.6% for genotype
SB 894-1 and 3.2% for genotype SB 894-3. This was not a significantly higher mean
germination percentage than what was exhibited by genotype SB 994-1 at 21.6%.
The mean germination percentages for all genotypes at the 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment level
dropped to 4%. Genotype SB 894-2 again exhibited a significantly higher mean
germination percentage at 9.4% versus 1% for SB 894-3 and 0.2% for SB 894-1. It was
not significantly different from genotype SB 994-1 which exhibited 5.2% germination.
In summary, the results of the screwbean mesquite experiment show lower mean
germination percentages in comparison with the honey mesquite genotypes. Mean
germination percentages at each treatment level are 29.4% (control), 27.1% (5 mmhos
cm-1), 24.2% (10 mmhos cm-1), 16% (20 mmhos cm-1) and 4% (40 mmhos cm-1). None of
the genotypes exhibited a significantly greater germination percentage over another at the
control and 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels. However, at the 10, 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1
treatment levels, genotype SB 894-2 did exhibit a significantly greater germination
percentage over genotypes SB 894-1 and SB 894-3.
Soil salinity concentrations derived from soil samples taken at the collection sites did not
appear to have a direct correlation to the germination percentages observed in these
experiments. The collection site for genotype SB 894-3 was determined to have the
highest soil salinity readings versus the other three collection sites (Table 2). However,
this genotype did not exhibit significantly greater germination percentages in the
laboratory experiments. In contrast, the collection site for SB 894-2 revealed nonsaline
soil conditions and this genotype consistently exhibited higher mean germination
percentages over SB 894-3 at all treatment levels. The low mean germination
percentages for all genotypes may be attributed to hard seed or experimental error.
Results of the DRI experiments on screwbean mesquite are summarized as follows:
Germination results revealed nearly 100% germination at the control, 2.34 and 9.38
mmhos cm-1 treatment levels. At the 28.13 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, partial radicle
