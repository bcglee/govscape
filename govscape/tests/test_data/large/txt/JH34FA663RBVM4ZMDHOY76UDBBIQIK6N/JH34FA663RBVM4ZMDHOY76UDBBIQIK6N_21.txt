mm broad and 4-20 cm long, the uppermost greatly reduced, usually sparsely hispid
with long papilla-based hairs, at least in vicinity of ligule; inflorescence well exerted
above uppermost leaf, mostly 4-10 cm long and with 2-(1-)8 primary branches 3-9 cm
long, these infrequently rebranched; branches slender, terete below the spikelets;
internodes of branch rachis and pedicels ciliate on margins, at least the terminal
internodes and pedicels with a narrow medial groove. Sessile spikelets 3-4.5 mm long,
narrowly ovate; first glume never with a glandular pit or depression, usually scabrous on
margins and hispid on back below middle, the apex acute; lemma awn geniculate and
twisted, mostly 1-1.5 mm long; pediceled spikelet staminate, awnless, about as long as
sessile one but usually narrower; first glume glabrous or hairy below middle.9
Bothriochloa ischaemum, P.I. 237110, was evaluated for its use in providing vegetative
cover on abandoned cropland and critically disturbed areas. Another potential use
considered this species as a warm-season, irrigated pasture grass. P.I. 237110 performs
well at elevations below 1,200 m (3,900 ft) within rainfall zones of 200-355 mm (8-14
inches). Potential soils to which this cultivar is adapted to includes loamy sand, loamy
fine sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam and silt loam.
History:
In August 1989, a large-scale seed production block was established in Field, Borders 18
& 19 at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (Tucson PMC). Seed harvests were conducted
in the late spring and late fall using the Flail-Vac seed harvester.
Tucson PMC personnel also comparatively evaluated Bothriochloa ischaemum, P.I.
237110 and 'Ganada'. Evaluation factors included: germination rates under various
osmotic potentials, seedling vigor at various osmotic potentials, tolerance to drought-like
conditions, water use efficiency, stomate densities, leaf surface areas, specific leaf
weights, apparent photosynthetic rates, and dark respiration rates.
Results and Discussion:
This accession will not be released for commercial production due to a lack of interest by
customers for introduced species. Yellow bluestem has been and is currently being
studied extensively for use as a pasture grass in the southern Great Plains region of the
U.S. The following report summarizes the final evaluations conducted with this
accession.
