Salinity:
The Colorado River has been increasing in salinity in the years since the river was
dammed, and is projected to continue to increase , but at lower rates (U.S. Dept. of the
Interior 1989). This does not bode well for the salt-sensitive native plants in riparian
zones.
Salt tolerance is known to differ with ontogeny, so the tolerance of a particular species
may differ at each of its physiological stages of development, such as germination,
seedling growth, vegetative growth, flowering and fruiting. Barley, sugar beet and cotton,
for instance, are among the most salt tolerant agricultural crops, but each is relatively
sensitive during either germination or early seedling growth. The level of tolerance at one
growth stage cannot be assumed to be the same level of tolerance at any other (Shannon
1984; Maas 1986).
Allen et al. (1994) discuss the potential for developing salt tolerance in forest tree species.
They discuss three major points: 1) evidence exists that demonstrates considerable
intraspecific variation in salt tolerance in many species; 2) evidence associated with
differences in the ability to exclude Na+ and Cl- from leaves are important factors
underlying intraspecific differences in tolerance; 3) progress towards improving salt
tolerance of forest trees.
A number of studies cited by Allen et al. (1994) have been conducted to measure salt
tolerance in woody perennial plant species. Compared with annual crop and horticultural
species, there is very little literature relating to intraspecific variation in salt tolerance of
forest trees. Van der Moezel et al. (1989) found that the highest intraspecific variability
in salt tolerance occurred in the species that were least tolerant overall. This may suggest
that progress in the development of salt tolerant genotypes may be possible in species
traditionally thought to have a low salt tolerance (Allen et al. 1994).
Allen et al. (1994) state that the mechanisms of salt tolerance may be divided into two
broad categories: 1) avoidance and 2) tissue tolerance. Greenway and Munns (1980)
explain that avoidance refers to the ability to keep salt ions away from parts of the plant
where they may cause damage. This may be achieved by passive exclusion of ions
because of selective membrane permeability, active extrusion or dilution through the
development of succulent tissue. Tissue tolerance refers to situations where salt ions
accumulate in tissues, and their presence is accommodated by some means, usually by
compartmentation in vacuoles and corresponding osmoregulation in the cytoplasm.
According to Allen et al. (1994), a large amount of evidence has been collected that
demonstrates the elaborate, multigenic control of response to salinity (Dvorack et al.
1992). The complex pattern of inheritance to salt tolerance in trees is supported by
studies done on Citrus (Cooper and Gorton 1952; Furr and Ream 1969; Sykes 1992). It
was also stated that genes with major effects on salt tolerance can be found and that salt
