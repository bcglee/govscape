1977 TETRACHNE DREGEI ADVANCED EVALUATION
(Project Number: 04A810G)
1995 - FINAL REPORT
by
Mark Pater
Abstract:
In 1977, Tetrachne dregei (Karoograss) was included as part of the Warm-
and Cool-Season Grass initial evaluation planting (IEP) which was installed
at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (TPMC). This IEP was initiated to
identify potentially superior grass species which could be utilized for either
range improvement plantings, site stabilization projects or mine reclamation
work in MLRA’s 30, 35 and 40. One Karoograss accession was selected in
1981 out of this IEP for further evaluations. Tucson PMC personnel
observed potentially undesirable growth characteristics by this species and it
was decided to remove Karoograss from the testing program.
KEY WORDS: Tetrachne dregei, Karoograss, introduced.
Introduction:
Karoograss (P.I. 330683) was selected in 1981 out of the 1977 Warm- and Cool-Season
Grass IEP which was installed at the TPMC. This IEP was initiated in order to evaluate
various grass species for their potential use in rangeland improvement, critical area
stabilization, mine reclamation and pasture and hayland plantings.
History:
The 1977 Warm- and Cool-Season Grass IEP was initiated to evaluate various grasses to
be used in range improvement, critical area stabilization, and mine reclamation in
MLRA’s 30, 35 and 40. MLRA 30 contains some of the harshest sites in Arizona in
terms of annual rainfall (76-178 mm) and temperatures (>49 °C during summer months).
The grasses in this trial were evaluated for vigor, forage production, size, and ability to
spread. Each accession was evaluated individually to be able to select the superior
accessions, which in turn will be increased and evaluated further. This initial evaluation
project lasted from 1977-1981.3
Karoograss is an introduced, warm-season species originating from South Africa.
