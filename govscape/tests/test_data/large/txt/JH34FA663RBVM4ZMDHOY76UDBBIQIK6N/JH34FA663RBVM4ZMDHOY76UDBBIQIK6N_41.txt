Measuring Leaf Surface Areas
Leaf areas were determined following the gas exchange experiments using a light-
sensitive automatic area meter. Leaf samples were obtained by
removing all of the leaf and sheath material from the plants that were used in the gas
exchange experiments. Leaf samples were placed on the Licor Leaf
Area Meter where after passing through a beam of light the machine displays the surface
area in cm2. Leaf sample measurements were averaged on a plant by plant basis for each
cultivar to obtain the mean leaf surface area. Leaf and sheath samples were then dried for
24 hours at 60 ºC and weighed. Specific leaf weights (SLW) were calculated by dividing
the leaf surface area measurements into the dry weight measurements and expressed as
mg cm-2.
Measuring Water Use Efficiency
Ten plants of each population were grown in pots in the greenhouse at the Tucson
PMC. These plants are separate from those used in the previous experiments. Each plant
was grown in a 0.8-L plastic pot containing 750 grams of commercial potting mix. The
plants were initially propagated from seedlings grown in conetainers and after 6 months
of growth were transplanted into 0.8-L plastic pots and maintained in the Tucson PMC
greenhouse. Daytime temperatures in the greenhouse were maintained between 32 and 35
ºC and nighttime temperatures were maintained between 24 and 27 ºC. The plants were
watered twice a day (morning and afternoon) with an automatic overhead mist system.
No artificial lighting was used, however, the greenhouse was covered with shade cloth
which reduced the natural sunlight entering the greenhouse by approximately 50%.
At the beginning of this experiment each plant was initially trimmed back to a 5
cm height above the lip of the pot. The potting soil was covered with styrofoam to reduce
evaporative water loss from the soil surface (Dobrenz et al. 1968). The drain holes at the
base of each plastic pot were plugged with a rubber stopper to prevent water loss via soil
drainage. Each pot was then watered while placed on a scale and brought to a weight of
2,000 g. This was determined to be the "base" weight for each plant. The soil moisture
content at the 2,000 g "base weight" was at a point just above field capacity. Every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning for 4 weeks each plant was weighed to
determine water loss and re-watered until it reached the "base" weight of 2,000 g. The
amount of water required to bring each pot back up to its "base" weight was recorded. At
the end of the experiment each plant was clipped back to its original height. The clipped
material for each plant was separated into leaves and culms and placed into marked
°
sample bags. This clipped material was taken to the lab and dried for 24 hr at 80 C and
weighed. The weight of the dried material for each plant within each population was then
divided by the SLW (mg cm-2) for each respective plant. This permitted approximation
of the total leaf area for each plant. This area was then divided by the amount of water
used at the last reading for each plant, to obtain the amount of water transpired per cm2
for a 72 hour period. WUE was determined for each plant by dividing total amount of dry
matter produced into the total amount of water used.
