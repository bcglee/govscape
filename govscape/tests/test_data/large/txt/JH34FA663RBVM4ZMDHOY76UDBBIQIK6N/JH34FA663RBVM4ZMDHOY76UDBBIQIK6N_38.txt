chamber was attached to a second chamber with two small hoses made of surgical tubing
(Fig. 1). This second chamber was called the "leaf chamber." To measure apparent
photosynthetic rates, a single leaf was carefully inserted through the length of the leaf
chamber. Both ends of the leaf chamber were then sealed shut using a pliable clay
material that allowed for an air-tight seal.
The circulation chamber was fitted with two rubber septa (plugs) through which a
needle and syringe, with their plungers depressed, is placed. At the onset of the process
(at 0-time), after the fan circulated the gases
within the system for 1 minute, a 6 ml sample was taken by pulling back the plunger of
the first syringe. This first sample was then removed from the circulation chamber and
