The primary objective for the target species in this project is to determine which
genotypes, if any, are more tolerant to saline conditions. Soil samples taken from various
collection sites revealed soil salinity levels ranging from nonsaline (<2 ds/m) to strongly
saline (>16 ds/m). Experiments for this project tried to determine whether genotypes
collected from sites classified as moderately or strongly saline would exhibit higher
tolerances to salt concentrations than genotypes collected from sites classified as
nonsaline or very slightly saline. Individual genotypes that exhibit a higher level of
tolerance to saline conditions may prove themselves useful for revegetation projects on
moderate to strongly saline sites along the Lower Colorado River. The collection sites for
these genotypes can easily be identified at the time of seed collection and recorded using
standard legal descriptions (Township, Range, Section) for future reference.
Target Species for this Project:
Atriplex lentiformis (Torr.) Wats. - Quailbush
An erect, rapid-growing shrub forming a rounded or globular outline, reaching a height of
approximately 3.05 m where the water table is high. It is found at elevations up to 1,219
m in moist or dry saline soil types from along the Colorado River in southwestern
Arizona, southeastern California, northern Sonora, Mexico, north to southern Utah and
Nevada (Kearny and Peebles 1960).
Prosopis juliflora (Swartz) DC - Honey mesquite
A large shrub or small tree reaching a height of 9 m or more with crooked branches and a
rounded crown. Trunk dividing into branches a short distance above the ground. Root
system radially spreading and deep (Vines 1976). Found growing at elevations of 1,524
m and lower, mainly along water streams where the water table is relatively high, from
southern Kansas to southeastern California and Mexico (Kearny and Peebles 1960).
Prosopis pubescens Benth. - Screwbean mesquite
A small, thorny tree with short leaves and unique fruits. It looks like honey mesquite, but
with both leaves and fruits only 2.54-5.08 cm long. Not so generally abundant as honey
mesquite. Found growing at elevations of 1,219 m and lower (Kearny and Peebles 1960).
Distribution, southwestern North America, Baja California, and northern Mexico
(Simpson 1977).
Populus fremontii Wats. - Fremont cottonwood
Dioecious, deciduous tree attaining a height of 15-30 m, the trunk diameter may reach 1.2
m (Kearny and Peebles 1960). The stout, spreading or pendulous branches form a broad,
open crown. Conspicuous along streams throughout the state except in higher mountains.
Found at elevations from sea level to 2,134 m, southwestern New Mexico, Colorado,
Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and California; in Mexico in Lower California and Sonora (Vines
1976).
Salix gooddingii Ball - Gooding willow
