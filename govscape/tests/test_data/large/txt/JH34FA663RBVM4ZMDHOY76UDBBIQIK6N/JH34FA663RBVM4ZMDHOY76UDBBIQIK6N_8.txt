1990 ERIOGONUM WRIGHTII ADVANCED EVALUATION
(Project Number: 04A9001L)
1995 - FINAL REPORT
by
Mark Pater
Abstract:
In 1983, the Eriogonum species initial evaluation planting (IEP) was installed
at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (TPMC) to evaluate and identify
potentially superior ecotypes for uses in various revegetation projects. One
accession, shrubby buckwheat, was selected in 1990 out of this IEP for
further evaluations. However, due to a limited genetic base for this shrubby
buckwheat population, the project has been removed from the TPMC
evaluation process.
KEY WORDS: Eriogonum wrightii, shrubby buckwheat,
Introduction:
Eriogonum wrightii, 9034580, was selected in 1990 out of the 1983 Eriogonum spp. IEP
(Initial Evaluation Planting) for its good overall performance and superior ability to
produce viable seed. The 1983 Eriogonum spp. IEP (Project Number: 04I383H) was
initiated to try and identify a superior ecotype(s) for potential uses in various revegetation
projects. Improved cultivars of drought tolerant shrubs are desired for use in Major Land
Resource Areas (MLRA's) 35,40, and 41. The Eriogonum species in the IEP were
evaluated for emergence, survival, vigor, height and width, and seed production
capabilities.
Description
Eriogonum wrightii (shrubby buckwheat) is a native, white-tomentose, leafy perennial
growing up to 60 cm in height, remaining woody near the base. It flowers June-
September, peduncles seminaked, solitary or irregularly 2-3-forked, slender, ascending,
tomentose; involucres loosely spicate, sessile, 2-3 mm (1/12-1/8 in) long, teeth rigid and
acute; petals absent; sepaloid segments of the perianth 6 2-3 mm (1/12-1/8 in) long,
glabrous, white or pink; stamens 9; styles 3, stigmas capitate, ovary 1-celled. The fruit is
a solitary achene, erect, scabrous, base acute, 3-angled. The leaves are mostly on the
lower half of the plant, scattered, alternate or clustered, oval to oblong or linear to
lanceolate, apex acute, base tapering, margin entire, less than 2.5 cm (1 in) long, both
surfaces densely white-tomentose above and beneath. The stems are erect and slender,
woody toward the base, tomentose above, bark reddish brown, thin-scaly (Vines 1976).
