Rooting experiments conducted on the cottonwood genotypes revealed that as salt
concentration levels increased, mean leaf and root biomass production decreased
significantly. None of the cottonwood genotypes exhibited consistently higher mean
biomass production than any of the other genotypes across all treatment levels. Mean leaf
biomass production for all genotypes in the control treatment was 502 mg per genotype.
Mean leaf biomass production for all cottonwood genotypes at the other four treatment
levels were: 273 mg at 5 mmhos cm-1, 72 mg at 10 mmhos cm-1 and 0 mg at the 20 and 40
mmhos cm-1 treatment levels. Mean root biomass production for all cottonwood
genotypes in the control treatment was 31 mg per genotype. Mean root biomass
production at the other four treatment levels were: 20 mg at 5 mmhos cm-1, 4 mg at 10
mmhos cm-1 and 0 mg at 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1.
Rooting experiments conducted on the willow genotypes also revealed that as salt
concentration levels increased, mean leaf and root biomass production decreased
significantly. None of the willow genotypes exhibited consistently significantly higher
mean biomass production than any of the other willow genotypes across all treatment
levels. Mean leaf biomass production for all willow genotypes in the control treatment
was 576 mg per genotype. Mean leaf biomass production for all willow genotypes at the
other four treatment levels were 311 mg at 5 mmhos cm-1, 100 mg at 10 mmhos cm-1, 26
mg at 20 mmhos cm-1 and 0 mg at 40 mmhos cm-1. Mean root biomass production for all
willow genotypes in the control treatment was 142 mg per genotype. Mean root biomass
production for all willow genotypes at the other four treatment levels were 69 mg at 5
mmhos cm-1, 10 mg at 10 mmhos cm-1, 2 mg at 20 mmhos cm-1 and 0 mg at 40 mmhos
cm-1.
None of the genotypes in any of the germination experiments proved to be more salt
tolerant over any of the other genotypes in each respective species group. As expected, as
salinity levels increased, germination percentages decreased. None of the observed
germination percentages in the mesquite experiments appeared to be correlated to the soil
salinity data from each collection site.
All experiments for this project were conducted under controlled, laboratory conditions at
the Tucson PMC. These results may not relate directly to field conditions where
environmental factors fluctuate widely. Soil salinity concentration levels along the Lower
Colorado River may vary throughout the year depending on streamflow and climatic
conditions such as annual precipitation. Therefore, soil data collected for this project
most likely does not reflect accurate soil conditions.
Better results pertaining to the quailbush, honey mesquite and screwbean mesquite
genotypes may be obtained by replicating these experiments using seed harvested over a
three to five year period. This may provide adequate baseline data that can be used to set
up field experiments. The cottonwood and willow genotype experiments should also be
replicated over time in order to better observe the performance of each genotype within
each treatment level.
