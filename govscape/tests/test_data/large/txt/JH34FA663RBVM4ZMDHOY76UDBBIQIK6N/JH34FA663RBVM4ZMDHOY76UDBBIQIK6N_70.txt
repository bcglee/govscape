Dioecious, deciduous tree attaining a height of 13.5 m and a trunk diameter of 75 cm. In
Arizona it is found growing with cottonwood along the lower courses of the Colorado and
Gila rivers. Found growing at elevations up to 2,134 m but usually much lower. The
typical form, with pubescent ovaries and young capsules, is restricted mainly to the
Colorado River Valley, the trees in other parts of Arizona belonging mostly to var.
varibilis Ball (Kearny and Peebles 1960).
Germination experiments were conducted on the quailbush, honey mesquite and
screwbean mesquite genotypes. Five salt concentrations were utilized for these
experiments: 0 mmhos cm-1 (Control), 5 mmhos cm-1, 10 mmhos cm-1, 20 mmhos cm-1 and
40 mmhos cm-1 NaCl.
Twenty-seven quailbush genotypes were evaluated in this experiment (Table 1). Seed for
this experiment. Seed was harvested from various locations along the Lower Colorado
River during the months of November and December in 1993. The harvested material
was cleaned at the Tucson PMC and stored in a VWR Scientific general purpose
laboratory refrigerator. The experiment with these genotypes was initiated on January 30,
1995. Seed packets with 100 seeds per packet per genotype were organized and separated
for each treatment level. Salt concentrations were prepared using distilled water using a
Gyrotherm agitator to ensure thorough dissolution. Approximately four ml of solution
was administered to each petri dish. Each petri dish was lined with Whatman No. 1 filter
paper (bottom only) and the dishes were then placed into plastic Ziploc bags along with
wet sponges to maintain humidity within the plastic bags. The temperature settings for
this experiment were set at 8 hours at 25 °C/12 hours at 12 °C. The light bank in the
germinator was turned off. Germination data was collected every Monday, Wednesday
and Friday mornings. A seed was considered to have germinated and was removed from
the dish when the radicle was ≥2mm in length. Seeds that developed fungal growth were
removed and considered nonviable.
Five honey mesquite and four screwbean mesquite genotypes were evaluated in this
experiment (Table 2). Seed for these experiments was harvested from various locations
along the Lower Colorado River during the months of August and September, 1994. The
harvested material was cleaned at the Tucson PMC and stored in a VWR Scientific
general purpose laboratory refrigerator. Seeds were scarified during the cleaning process
while using the Westrup brush machine. The experiments for both species was initiated
on January 30, 1995. Seed packets with 100 seeds per packet per genotype were
organized and separated according to each treatment level.
Due to fungal growth on the mesquite seeds during preliminary germination tests, the
seed surfaces of the honey and screwbean mesquite genotypes were sterilized. A
technique described by Dodds and Roberts (1986) was followed. This method required
soaking the mesquite seeds in an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for
