Colorado River. The results may provide some information that is needed to effectively
restore and manage riparian ecosystems adjacent to the Colorado River. The results of
this study may also provide information pertaining to source locations of adapted native
plant material for use in riparian restoration and reclamation activities along the Lower
Colorado River.
Literature Review
The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) General Manual (1991)
defines riparian areas as ecosystems that occur along water courses or water bodies. They
are distinctly different from the surrounding lands because of unique soil and vegetation
characteristics that are strongly influenced by free water in the soil. Riparian ecosystems
occupy the transitional area between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Typical examples
would include floodplains, streambanks, and lakeshores.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) (1990) defines a riparian area as land directly
influenced by permanent water either on the surface or as free subsurface water within the
rooting zone of dependent vegetation. A riparian area has vegetation or physical
characteristics that reflect permanent water influence. Lake shores and stream banks are
typical riparian areas. Excluded are such sites as ephemeral streams or washes that do not
exhibit the presence of vegetation dependent upon free water in the soil.
Anderson and Ohmart (1985) offer a similar definition: “A riparian association of any
kind is one which occurs in or adjacent to drainageways and/or their floodplains and
which is further characterized by species and/or life-forms different from that of the
immediately surrounding non-riparian climax.”
Riparian Area Benefits:
The previous definitions of riparian areas indicate that one of the key aspects of riparian
areas is the relatively abundant supply of water. As human populations have grown and
agricultural lands expanded in the southwestern United States, the need for and scarcity
of water has caused many of the current water-related problems and the decline of
riparian areas. Some of the benefits of riparian areas are more obvious, such as increased
and diverse wildlife populations, aesthetic and recreational opportunities, and erosion
control. Other less obvious benefits of well-vegetated riparian areas, which are equally or
perhaps more important, may include reduced flood peaks by resistance to flow and
storage of floodwaters; providing key recharge points for renewing groundwater;
providing travel corridors for wildlife; cooling of water temperatures through shading by
riparian vegetation which also reduces evaporation and provides aquatic wildlife with
habitat; increasing length of time of streamflow, in some cases to perennial flow;
livestock use for forage, shade, shelter and water; and providing repositories for sediment
and acting as a nutrient sink for surrounding watersheds (BLM 1991; DeBano and
Schmidt 1989; Anderson and Ohmart 1985; Elmore and Beschta 1987).
