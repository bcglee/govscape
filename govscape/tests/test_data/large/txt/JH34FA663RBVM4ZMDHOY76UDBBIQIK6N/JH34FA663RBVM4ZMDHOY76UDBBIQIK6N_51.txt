DAY
Fig. 14. Average daily water use measurements for Ganada and P.I. 237110 (Day 1=
June 8, 1992).
WUE determinations should help to determine that species' range of distribution.
P.I. 237110 apparently took greater advantage of available moisture in
photosynthetic processes which resulted in greater dry matter production than Ganada.
Ganada appears to utilize the available water for increased transpiration in order to
maintain cooler tissue temperatures.
Leaf Anatomy
In a leaf cross section photograph of P.I. 237110, the bulliform cells appear very
prominently. According to Mauseth (1988), these cells may act as points of flexure: if
they are turgid and swollen, the leaf is open and flat, but if they lose water and become
flaccid the leaf folds, minimizing its exposed surface area. Shields (1951) reported that
such movements may involve other cells as well as the bulliform cells. It may be that the
primary function of bulliform cells is the opening of the leaf as it expands from the sheath
node. The bundle sheath cells in the photograph are characteristically large for a C
4
species and contain chloroplasts. The radially aligned chlorenchyma cells (mesophyll
cells) around the bundles are also characteristic of a C species (Kranz anatomy).

Mauseth (1988) describes how the mesophyll cells in C plants use a different enzyme to
4
take up CO very efficiently, as compared to C plants, and use it to manufacture

oxaloacetic acid. OAA is transported to the bundle sheath cells where it is broken down,
