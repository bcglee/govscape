readily visible and certain features that may be used as an indication of comparative
chromosomal numbers. Booth (1964) also noted that leaves located at different levels on
a plant may exhibit variation, and that plants grown in different habitats may also vary.
The epidermis is usually one cell layer thick (Esau 1976). and the epidermis of
most grasses is made up of cells of two distinct sizes (Booth 1964). The cells with long,
vertical axes (long axis parallel to the length of the leaf) are termed "long cells", and
those that are noticeably shorter in length are termed "short cells" (Booth 1964). The
long cells form the most distinct pattern of the leaf epidermis. The cells located within
the longitudinal line between the stomata are often somewhat different from the other
long cells and are referred to as interstomatal cells in order to separate them from cells
not associated with the stomata (Booth 1964). Short cells occur in rows parallel to the
long axis of the leaf blade either singly or in pairs, depending on the species. They may
be only in the costal zone (epidermal tissue located over leaf veins), only in the intercostal
zone (epidermal tissue located between leaf veins) or present in both zones. In some
species they may be entirely absent. They are easily identified by their shorter length
when compared with other cells of the epidermis (Booth 1964). All unicellular and
multicellular appendages of the epidermis are designated by the term "trichome" (Fahn
1967). The epidermal appendages of the grasses are diverse in form and structure. They
are represented mainly by macro-hairs, micro-hairs, prickles, and papillae (Booth 1964).
Stomata in grass leaves are confined to the intercostal regions where they may
form one or more well-defined longitudinal rows. The number of rows of stomata in the
intercostal zone will vary across species. Variation may also be found among the leaves
on a single plant or even within a single leaf (Booth 1964). Esau (1976) defined stomata
as apertures in the epidermis, each curbed by two guard cells. By changing their shape,
guard cells control the size of the stomatal opening. The guard cells are generally kidney
shaped in surface view. Esau (1976) also stated that an outstanding characteristic of
stomata is the unevenly thickened walls of the guard cells that appears to be related to the
changes in shape and volume which occur in the guard cells due to fluctuations in turgor
pressure.
The ground tissue of the leaf that is enclosed within the epidermis is called the
"mesophyll" (from the Greek words mesos, in the middle, and phyllon, leaf). The
mesophyll is usually specialized as a photosynthetic tissue and consists of living lacunose
parenchyma containing chloroplasts (Esau 1976). It occupies the space not occupied by
schlerenchyma and vascular bundles, and is readily identified by its translucency, or by a
green color, in which case it is designated as chlorenchyma. The cells are of a variety of
shapes, but do not follow the common pattern of being divided into palisade and spongy
parenchyma seen in dicotyledonous plants. The shape of the chlorenchyma cells is highly
variable among different grass species. Some species are noted for their uniformity of
cell shape, while other species exhibit cell shapes that are highly irregular in outline and
frequency (Booth 1964).
The vascular tissues of grass leaves are arranged in vascular bundles, mostly in a
single row in the mesophyll. Vascular bundles are usually associated with mechanical
tissues (xylem and phloem) and produce the characteristic venation of grasses that is
usually apparent from visual examination as well as from sectioned leaves. The term vein
