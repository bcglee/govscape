No significant differences were found among the five honey mesquite genotypes at the
control treatment level. The mean germination percentage for all genotypes at the control
treatment level was 83%.
At the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, one genotype exhibited a significantly lower mean
germination percentage at 75.4%. The mean germination percentage for all genotypes at
this treatment level was 83%, the highest mean percentage was 91% for the HM 894-2
genotype. Two genotypes exhibited significantly higher mean germination percentages at
the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, 86.8% for genotype HM 894-2 and 85.4% for
genotype HM 994-1.
At the 20 mmhos cm-1 treatment level, the highest mean germination percentage was
exhibited by genotype HM 894-1 at 66.6%. This genotype was significantly higher than
the two genotypes which had the lowest mean percent germination at 49% (HM 994-2)
and 45.8% (HM 894-2). Genotypes HM 994-1 and HM 994-3 did not exhibit any
significant difference in comparison with the other three genotypes.
There were no significant differences in the mean germination percentage between any of
the genotypes at the 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment level. The highest mean percentage being
7.8% (HM 894-1) and the lowest mean percentage of 3.4% (HM 994-2).
In summary, the results of the honey mesquite experiment showed that the five honey
mesquite genotypes germinated best (>50%) at all treatment levels except at 40 mmhos
cm-1. Mean germination percentages for the five treatment levels were: 83% (control),
84.6% (5 mmhos cm-1), 78.2% (10 mmhos cm-1), 57.4% (20 mmhos cm-1) and 5.7% (40
mmhos cm-1). Soil salinity concentrations derived from the soil samples taken at the
honey mesquite collection sites do not appear to have a direct correlation to the observed
germination percentages in these experiments. The collection site for genotype HM 994-
1 exhibited the highest soil salinity readings in comparison with the other four collection
sites (Table 2). However, this genotype did not exhibit significantly greater germination
percentages in comparison with the other four genotypes. The soil analysis data from the
other four collection sites revealed readings ranging from nonsaline to very slightly
saline.
Results of the DRI experiments on honey mesquite are summarized as follows:
Germination results revealed 100% germination up to and including the 28.13 mmhos
cm-1 treatment level. There was no germination at the 56.25 and 93.75 mmhos cm-1
treatment levels (Jackson et al. 1990).
Germination Experiments - Screwbean Mesquite Genotypes:
Mean percent germination at the control treatment level showed one genotype having
significantly lower germination with 17.2% (SB 894-1) than the genotype with the
highest mean percent germination, SB 994-1 at 43.2%. The other two genotypes were not
