Results of the DRI experiments on cottonwood are summarized as follows: There was
almost 100% mortality at the 56.25 and 93.75 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels after 30 days
and in the 28.13 mmhos cm-1 treatment level after day 60. The only surviving plants at
day 120 were in the control and 2.34 mmhos cm-1 treatment levels (Jackson et al. 1990).
Rooting Experiments - Willow Genotypes:
Mean dry weights (mg) of leaf and root material for all willow genotypes were collected
up to the 20 mmhos cm-1 treatment level. The 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment level did not
yield any measurable amounts. Mean dry weight amounts of leaf and root biomass were
calculated for each treatment level. Leaf dry weights generally greatly exceeded root dry
weights. At the control level, there were no significant differences between genotypes in
terms of leaf biomass production or mean root biomass production.
Mean leaf and root biomass production at the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level revealed no
clear, significant differences between the four genotypes. Genotype W-1 (540 mg)
produced mean leaf biomass amounts which were only significantly higher than
genotypes W-4 (211.8 mg) and W-5 (206 mg) but not significantly greater than genotype
W-6 (284.3 mg). Genotype W-1 also produced the highest mean amount of root biomass
(130 mg) but this was only significantly greater than genotype W-10 which produced 24
mg.
Results at the 10 mmhos cm-1 treatment level showed no significant differences between
all genotypes in terms of mean leaf biomass production and mean root biomass
production. Genotype W-4 produced the highest mean leaf biomass with 173.3 mg and
genotype W-10 the lowest with 65 mg. The highest mean root biomass was produced by
genotype W-1 with 29.3 mg and the lowest mean root biomass was produced by genotype
W-10 with 0 mg.
There were no significant differences at the 20 mmhos cm-1 treatment level between all
genotypes in terms of mean leaf biomass production and mean root biomass production.
The highest mean leaf biomass amount was produced by genotype W-4 with 69.3 mg.
The highest mean root biomass quantity was produced by genotype W-1 with 5 mg.
In summary, mean leaf biomass production greatly exceeded mean root biomass
production at all treatment levels. Predictably, as salt concentrations increased, biomass
production decreased. Mean leaf and root biomass production over all genotypes was
significantly greatest at the control level (Leaves: 576 mg, Roots: 142 mg). Production at
the 5 mmhos cm-1 treatment level was significantly greater than all other treatment levels
except the control treatment (Leaves: 311 mg, Roots: 69 mg). There were no significant
differences in total mean biomass production at the 10, 20 and 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment
levels. No measurable amounts of leaf or root biomass were produced by any genotypes
at the 40 mmhos cm-1 treatment level.
