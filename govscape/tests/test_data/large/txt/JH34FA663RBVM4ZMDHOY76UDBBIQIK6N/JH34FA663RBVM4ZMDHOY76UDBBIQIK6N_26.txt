is applied to a vascular bundle or a group of closely associated bundles that usually
produce an easily visible configuration (Booth 1964).
Fahn (1967) described two types of bundle sheaths that are distinguished in
grasses. In the subfamily Panicoideae (with the exception of certain species of Panicum)
the sheath consists of a single layer of thin-walled cells that contain chloroplasts. In the
subfamily Pooideae, the sheath consists of two layers of cells. The inner layer, which
apparently develops from the procambium, consists of living, thick-walled, chloroplast-
free cells that are elongated parallel to the veins, while the cells of the outer layer are thin-
walled and mostly contain chloroplasts. On the small veins the inner layer may be
present only on the side of the phloem.
Esau (1976) described the bulliform cells as large, thin-walled, highly vacuolated
cells that occur in almost all monocotyledonous orders. Bulliform cells either cover the
entire upper surface of the leaf blade or are restricted to grooves between the veins.
Bulliform cells may occur on both sides of the leaf and are not restricted to the epidermis
but are sometimes accompanied by similar cells in the subjacent mesophyll. Bulliform
cells contain much water and are completely or nearly devoid of chloroplasts. Their cell
wall consists of cellulose and pectic substances, and the outermost wall contains cutin
and is covered by cuticle (Fahn 1967).
The principal function attributed to the bulliform cells is the rolling or folding of
the leaf. The term "motor cells" is sometimes also used for these cells (Esau 1976). The
position of the bulliform cells, associated with their usually thin walls and large water-
filled vacuoles seems to indicate the possibility of change in turgor playing an important
role in the folding or rolling of the leaves. It has been found that in some grasses the
bulliform cells are rigid as a result of silicon accumulation and hence are unable to
change shape (Booth 1964). Shields (1951) stated that involution of the leaves, which is
especially common in grasses, is a characteristic brought about by the action of the
bulliform cells and/or other epidermal and mesophyll elements which may be
parenchymatous or sclerenchymatous. Booth (1964) further explained that bulliform
cells have proven to be useful for taxonomic purposes, the following being some of the
characters most commonly used: (1) Cell uniformity: bulliform cells regular vs. irregular
(irregular mixing of small and large cells); (2) Number of cells: the cells are counted in
transverse sections of leaves; (3) Size of cells: size is determined as a ratio of bulliform
cell length and width to regular epidermal cell dimensions. Because of the variation in
size of the bulliform cells, it is often necessary to select the largest cells; (4) Position of
strands: position is given in reference to vascular bundles or furrows; (5) Pattern outline:
this is the form or outline of the bulliform strand as it appears in the leaf cross-section;
and (6) Cell shapes, thickness of cell walls, and extension of the bulliform cells into the
mesophyll.
Cutter (1971) stated that all grasses belonging to the Chloridoid-Eragrostoid and
Panicoid divisions of the Gramineae have low CO compensation values. These grasses

all have certain anatomical features in common, namely specialized bundle sheath cells in
the leaves. Some of these grasses, which have the C -dicarboxylic acid (Hatch-Slack)
4
photosynthetic pathway, are capable of lowering the concentration of CO in a closed
2
system to less than 5 ppm, and are therefore said to show low CO compensation values

(Downton and Tregunna 1968). Most plants have higher compensation values, being
