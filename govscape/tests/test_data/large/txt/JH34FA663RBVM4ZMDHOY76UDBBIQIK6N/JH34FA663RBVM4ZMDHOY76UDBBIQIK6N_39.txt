the needle immediately inserted in a rubber stopper to prevent the sample from being
contaminated with outside gases. After the gases circulated within the system for 2
minutes, a second 6 ml sample was taken.
Ten sample measurements were taken from five potted plants of each population
at the TPMC from 11:00-11:45 am under full sunlight. The samples in the syringes were
then taken to the lab for measurement of CO concentration differences between each pair

of samples for each plant. The CO concentration differences in each pair of syringes was

measured using a Beckman model 865 infrared gas analyzer. Five ml of the gas within
each pair of syringes was individually injected into a nitrogen gas carrier flowing at 1 L
per minute through the analyzer (Fig. 2) and the peak output was measured with a micro-
volt meter. The system was calibrated with standard gases of known CO concentration.

The differences in CO concentrations between the first and second syringes taken from
2
each leaf was a measure of CO uptake.

Laboratory Measurements of Apparent Photosynthesis and Dark Respiration
Five potted plants of each population which were used in the previous experiment
were taken to the lab to measure apparent photosynthesis and dark respiration. Prior to
obtaining any measurements, each plant was first placed under a light bank (2000 µΕin m-
2 s-1 ) for 5 minutes. This presumably allowed the plants' photosynthetic mechanisms to
reach a steady optimum
rate. Each plant was then placed in an airtight photosynthetic chamber and illuminated
with 2000 µΕin m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) with approximately
0.035% CO concentration flowing through closed system. It should be noted that with
