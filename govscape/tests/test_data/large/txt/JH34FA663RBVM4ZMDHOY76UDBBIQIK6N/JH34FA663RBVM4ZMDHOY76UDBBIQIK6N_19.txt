(Project Number: 04A9001L)
1995 - FINAL REPORT

Abstract:
Bothriochloa ischaemum (Yellow bluestem), P.I. 237110, was initially selected
for its superior performance in the 1975 Critical Area and Range
Improvement Grass IEP7. In 1983 this accession was included in the 1983
Yellow Bluestem Intercenter Strain Trial (Project Number: 04R006H). In
1989, Bothriochloa ischaemum, P.I. 237110, was selected for advanced
evaluation for its superior forage production, drought tolerance, vigor, early
grownup and robust appearance. Studies on this species were concluded in
1993. This accession was not released for commercial production.
KEY WORDS: Bothriochloa ischaemum, yellow bluestem, introduced,.
Introduction:
Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng is an introduced, warm-season, C, tufted, perennial
4
bunchgrass with slender, strictly erect or decumbent culms, these becoming somewhat
stoloniferous or rhizomatous under close grazing or cutting. Culms mostly 30-50 cm tall
but occasionally over 100 cm long when decumbent or trailing at base; Culm nodes
bearded with short hairs, glabrate in age; sheaths glabrous; ligule a short, truncate
membrane, usually 1 mm or less long; blades linear-attenuate, mostly 2-4 mm broad and
4-20 cm long, the uppermost greatly reduced, usually sparsely hispid with long papilla-
based hairs, at least in vicinity of ligule; inflorescence well exerted above uppermost leaf,
mostly 4-10 cm long and with 2-(1-)8 primary branches 3-9 cm long, these infrequently
rebranched; branches slender, terete below the spikelets; internodes of branch rachis and
pedicels ciliate on margins, at least the terminal internodes and pedicels with a narrow
medial groove. Sessile spikelets 3-4.5 mm long, narrowly ovate; first glume never with a
glandular pit or depression, usually scabrous on margins and hispid on back below
middle, the apex acute; lemma awn geniculate and twisted, mostly 1-1.5 mm long;
pediceled spikelet staminate, awnless, about as long as sessile one but usually narrower;
first glume glabrous or hairy below middle.8
Bothriochloa ischaemum, P.I. 237110, was evaluated for its use in providing vegetative
cover on abandoned cropland and critically disturbed areas. Another potential use
considered this species as a warm-season, irrigated pasture grass. P.I. 237110 performs
well at elevations below 1,200 m (3,900 ft) within rainfall zones of 200-355 mm (8-14
