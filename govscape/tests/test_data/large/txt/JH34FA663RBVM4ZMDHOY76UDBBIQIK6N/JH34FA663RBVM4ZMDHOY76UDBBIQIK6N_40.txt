To measure dark respiration, the light bank was turned off and the airtight plant
chamber was covered with a black cloth. The increase in CO concentration within the
2
atmosphere of the closed system was analyzed and recorded for 1 minute. Apparent
photosynthesis was calculated from the initial slope of decreased CO concentration
2
recorded. Dark respiration was calculated from the steady state slope of CO increase
2
recorded within the closed system. Gas fluxes were expressed as µmol CO m-2 s-1.
