ABSTRACT
Yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng.) cultivars are used in
conservation plantings in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The recommended
cultivar in southern Arizona is Ganada. However, a population from Saudi Arabia,
P.I. 237110, may be better adapted to the Sonoran Desert environment. This study
was conducted to determine why P.I. 237110 may be better adapted to this
environment than Ganada. Morphological and physiological characteristics of P.I.
237110 and Ganada were compared in five experiments. Evaluations revealed
significant differences in combined stomate densities on both leaf surfaces, leaf
surface area, and water use efficiency but not in apparent photosynthesis or dark
respiration. Combined average stomate density was significantly lower for P.I.
237110 than Ganada (107 vs. 136 stomates mm-2). P.I. 237110 had a significantly
higher leaf surface area (40.5 cm2 ) than Ganada (25.3 cm2 ). Apparent
photosynthetic rates were not significantly different between the populations
(Ganada: 12 µµµµmol m-2 s-1 and P.I. 237110: 10 µµµµmol m-2 s-1). Dark respiration rates
for Ganada were not significantly different (1.4 µµµµmol m-2 s-1) from those of P.I.
237110 (1.9 µµµµmol m-2 s-1). P.I. 237110 required 88.9 g of water per 1 g of dry matter
than Ganada which required 52.3 g of water.
INTRODUCTION
Yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum [L.] Keng.), sometimes classified
within the "Old World Bluestems" (OWB), is an apomictic, C , warm-season, perennial
4
bunchgrass that has been introduced into North America (Dalrymple 1990). The culms
are noticeably pale yellow, with dark nodes, leaves are mostly basal, slightly scabrous
above with scattered long hairs more prominent near the base of the blade, and foliage
color is generally light green. The typical inflorescence consists of several unbranched
racemes arranged subdigitally on an axis distinctly shorter than the longest raceme.
Individual plants tend to form large, saucer-shaped clumps with the stems curving up
from the periphery (Gould 1975).
The Old World Bluestems have been commercially available in the U.S.A. since
the 1930's when Caucasian bluestem (Bothriochloa caucasica [Trin.] C.E. Hub.) came
into use. These species (Caucasian and Yellow bluestem) were originally introduced into
Texas and southwestern Oklahoma from Eurasia and North Africa, primarily for use as
