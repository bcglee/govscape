comparative evaluation of six blue panic grass clones, those that were drought tolerant as
seedlings had a lower stomate density than the drought susceptible clones and no
relationship was found between stomate density and water use efficiency. This study also
showed that stomate density varied with leaf position and age. The younger leaves at the
top of the flowering culm had a significantly lower stomate density than leaves from the
middle or the base of the culm. Data averaged over the six clones also showed the
abaxial surface of the leaves to have a significantly higher stomate density than the
adaxial leaf surface.
Photosynthesis and Dark Respiration
Ultimately the most important physiological factor affecting plant productivity is
the photosynthetic process. Calvin and Bassham (1962) described a pathway for CO
2
fixation in which CO was incorporated into a 6-carbon compound and rapidly converted
2
to a 3-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA). This pathway, also known as
the C pathway (or Calvin cycle), was considered to be the major photosynthetic
3
mechanism for carbon (C) fixation. However, Hatch and Slack (1966) later characterized
a form of CO fixation in which CO was first incorporated in 4-carbon compounds
2 2
(aspartic, malic, or oxalocetic acid) prior to transfer to sugars by way of 3-
phosphoglycerate. The proposed mechanism involved the operation of two interrelated
metabolic cycles. Downton (1970) described carbon fixation into C -dicarboxylic acids
4
in mesophyll cells and the subsequent incorporation into the Calvin cycle located in the
bundle sheath cells. These plants possessing the 4-carbon pathway (C plants) were
4
generally found to be of tropical origin and more efficient in fixing CO . They were also
2
found to produce three times more dry matter than C plants, especially in relatively
3
sunny, warm, dry climates (Black 1971).
Black (1971) explained that a variety of characteristics differentiate plants that
have the C photosynthetic pathway from those with the C photosynthetic pathway. In
4 3
C plants compared to C plants: net photosynthetic rate is two to three times greater;
4 3
CO2 compensation points are lower; bundle sheath cells contain chloroplasts and starch;
discrimination against 13C compounds is lower; and CO fixation initially yields 4-C
2
acids as opposed to 3-C acids.
Waller and Lewis (1979) described how leaf anatomy also provides an easily
distinguished difference between C and C plants. Plants with the C photosynthetic
3 4 3
pathway do not have well defined parenchymatic bundle sheaths and starch grains are
found mainly within the mesophyll (Bisalputra et al. 1969) while C plants generally have
4
well developed parenchymatic bundle sheaths containing high concentrations of
chloroplasts and starch. Bundle sheath cells utilize the C photosynthetic process,
3
however, they are surrounded by mesophyll cells containing chloroplasts utilizing the C
4
photosynthetic process which fix and then supply C for the C pathway. Stern (1991)
3
stated that the C pathway provides CO to the Calvin cycle more efficiently than the C
4 2 3
pathway thereby reducing of photorespiration. The presence of two active photosynthetic
