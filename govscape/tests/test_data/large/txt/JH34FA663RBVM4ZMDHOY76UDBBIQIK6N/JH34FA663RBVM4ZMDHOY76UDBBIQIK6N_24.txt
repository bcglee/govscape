functions of photosynthesis and respiration. They also play an important role in
supporting and protecting the developing shoot.
Gould and Shaw (1983) also state that the sheath typically has the general shape
of a hollow cylinder that is split down one side. The margins of the sheath commonly
overlap, both at the point of attachment and for all or most of the length of the sheath. In
Glyceria, Bromus, Festuca, and other genera, the margins of the sheath are completely or
incompletely united (connate) from the base upward (Gould and Shaw 1983). The nerves
of the sheath are usually numerous and relatively uniform in development. However,
frequently, there is a distinct midrib. Such grasses as Andropogon virginicus L.,
Muhlenbergia emersleyi Vasey., Poa compressa L., and many species of Chloris that
have flattened culms, also have sharply keeled and laterally compressed leaf sheaths.
Gould and Shaw (1983) define the ligule as usually a thin, white or brownish
membrane, but in some grasses, especially those of the Chloridoideae, it consists of a
fringe of hairs or is absent. The Mexican grass Muhlenbergia macroura Hitchc.
(Epicampes macroura Benth.) has a broad, firm ligule 2 to 4 cm long. Sorghastrum
nutans (L.) Nash. has a stiff, brownish ligule that is usually divided into a rounded central
lobe and two stiff, pointed lateral projections. The latter have been referred to as sheath
auricles (Hitchcock 1951). In Leptoloma cognatum (Schult.) Chase there is a gradual
transition from sheath to ligule on either side of the blade attachment. The green lateral
nerves of the sheath extend upward into the marginal portions of the ligule. A particular
type of ligule is usually consistent for all species of a genus. However in Panicum there
are both membranous and hairy ligules, and in some species the ligule is absent.
The leaf blade, is typically linear or lanceolate, with parallel nerves and entire,
smooth or scabrous margins. Blade size and shape vary within wide limits (Gould and
Shaw 1983). The blades of MonanthochloÃ« littoralis Engelm. are infrequently over 1 cm
long. At the other extreme, the blades of the bamboo Neurolepis nobilis Mun. reach 4.5
m in length and 30 cm in width (Arber 1934). Grasses of the humid tropics tend to have
large, often ovate or oblong blades. In contrast, grasses of semiarid regions commonly
have narrow, linear blades that are often involute to better withstand drought. Aciculate
blades are extremely narrow and permanently involute to the extent that the internal
structure is altered. Variation in nervation of the leaf blade is somewhat greater than in
the sheath. Broad, flat blades, such as in Sorghastrum halepense (L.) Pers. and Zea mays
L., have a large, strongly developed midnerve. Narrow blades that become involute
usually have uniformly developed nerves and lack a prominent midnerve.
Leaf development and final morphology depend on genotype, ontogenetic
position, and on growth environment. All features of leaf structure and physiology,
including size, shape, cell size, trichome density, stomatal distribution, and
photosynthetic capacities are sensitive to the growth environment and contribute to a
plant's adaptability. Although a given set of characters may be adaptive in the natural
situation, they may be of little or no advantage when introduced into new environments
(Baker et al. 1985).
Generally, grass leaves contain three types of tissue elements: epidermis,
mesophyll, and vascular tissues (Fahn 1967). Booth (1964) states that in seed plants, the
epidermis reaches its highest degree of specialization in the Gramineae with the possible
exception of the Cyperaceae. The epidermis provides a wide variety of characters that are
