SUMMARY
Five experiments were conducted to compare the physiological and morphological
differences between Ganada and P.I. 237110 yellow bluestem. P.I. 237110 yellow
bluestem is currently being evaluated at the Tucson PMC for its potential use as a
conservation plant in the lower deserts of the southwestern United States. Ganada yellow
bluestem is a commercially available cultivar that was released by the Los Lunas, New
Mexico PMC in 1979. Stomate densities for both populations were measured on both
leaf surfaces as well as the leaf sheaths. Photosynthetic rates were measured outside
under full sunlight, as well as in a laboratory setting under simulated sunlight conditions
(2,000 ÂµEin m-2 s-1). Dark respiration was measured in the laboratory under controlled
conditions. WUE values were obtained using containerized plants grown in a greenhouse
at the TPMC.
The average stomate densities for both populations were significantly higher in
Ganada on both leaf surfaces than in P.I. 237110. Both populations revealed significantly
higher stomate densities on the abaxial leaf surface than the adaxial leaf surface. Stomate
densities for both populations were higher on the leaves in the lower and middle portions
of the plant canopy than in the upper plant canopy. Lower stomate densities in the upper
plant canopy may help reduce water loss from transpiration due to higher air temperatures
and light intensities as compared to those in the middle and lower plant canopy. The
observed stomate densities on the sheaths of both plant populations were significantly
different with Ganada having more stomates than P.I. 237110. Specific leaf weight was
also significantly higher for Ganada than P.I. 237110.
Field and laboratory measurements of photosynthesis did not reveal any
significant differences between the two populations. The dark respiration rates obtained
in the laboratory were also not significantly different between the two populations.
The WUE experiment showed significant differences between P.I. 237110 and
Ganada (Ganada required 52 units of water to produce a unit of dry matter while P.I.
237110 required 89 units). These differences were most likely due to P.I. 237110 having
a significantly higher total leaf surface area which in return results in a higher number of
stomates per plant. The difference in WUE values may also be explained by considering
the original collection sites for these two populations. Ganada originated in Turkestan
(presently Turkmenistan) which is characterized as having a cold desert climate
(Trewartha and Horn 1980). P.I. 237110 was originally collected in Saudi Arabia from
the Al Khars region which has a much hotter desert climate during the growing season
(Trewartha and Horn 1980). Ganada also originates from an area of a more northerly
latitude and therefore may be more adapted to shorter daylengths as well as a cooler
climate. From a strictly geographical standpoint P.I. 237110 appears to be better adapted
to Sonoran desert climate than Ganada. Ganada performs better than P.I. 237110 at
elevations above 1,065 m and in areas with cooler summer temperatures such as central
and northern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado (Anonymous 1979).
