Factors Detrimental to Riparian Areas:
Considering the previously mentioned benefits, working to prevent further degradation of
riparian areas would appear to be a highly advantageous proposition. However, the
problems associated with the decline of these areas are complex and require long-term
commitments by many people and agencies in order to begin to address the damage.
Stevens (1989) states that riparian systems are the most biologically productive and the
most poorly managed terrestrial habitats in the American Southwest. A major factor that
is detrimental to riparian areas is groundwater pumping and the subsequent lowering of
the water tables. According to a water-use study of phreatophytic species by Busch and
Smith (1992), the lowering of riparian water tables appears to have diminished the source
of shallow soil moisture supply and may be a causal factor in the increasing
impoverishment of the lower Colorado River floodplain vegetation with respect to its
formerly dominant trees, i.e., cottonwood (Populus fremontii S. Wats.) and willow (Salix
gooddingii Ball). Water diversion and channeling also have detrimental effects. For
example, channel migration and sediment deposition are important to the reproductive
biology of cottonwood. Damming and regulation of water flow has caused various
detrimental effects including increased salinity. Overgrazing may seriously reduce
seedling and sapling regrowth. Competition by the non-native salt cedar (Tamarix
chinensis Lour.) with native species has become more intense as riparian conditions
change. Tamarix is more tolerant to drought, inundation, higher salinity levels, fire, and
it flowers earlier and longer than native shrub and tree species. Non-maintenance of the
watershed is also affecting these areas. Reduction of waterflow due to agricultural and
other uses, excessive flooding, recreational overuse, commercial and residential
development, off-road vehicle use, increase in fire frequency, and water and air pollution
are additional factors presently threatening riparian areas (Stromberg 1990;
Reichenbacher 1984; Elmore and Beschta 1987; Brock 1984; Munda, personal comm.
1993; Busch and Smith 1993; Stevens 1989).
Riparian Area Ecology:
According to Stromberg (1990), in mixed broadleaf riparian forests, the streamside zone
is generally dominated by cottonwoods and willows, and the terrace (or upland) zone
supports mesquite (Prosopis spp.), hackberry (Celtis reticulata Torr.) or walnut (Juglans
major [Torr.] L. Benson). These zones are most distinct at lower elevations, due to
sharper environmental gradients between riparian and upland zones. Stromberg also
states that the seeding characteristics of the streamside plants are the result of small,
wind-dispersed seed (secondarily water dispersed) that have a rapid growth rate. This
adapts the group for a functional role as pioneering species. In contrast, the upland group
has fewer but larger seeds per plant, a slower growth rate, and utilizes animal as well as
abiotic factors for seed dispersal. These features are more characteristic of a stable
environment. All of the streamside group have an Arctotertiary origin, whereas the
upland trees either have a Neotropical origin (e.g. Prosopis spp.) or are primarily
restricted to warm temperate or tropical Arctotertiary refuges. This group also tends to
have germination and other processes stimulated by warmer temperatures and a lower
