(g' ) (Rawson et al. 1983). In the gamagrass studies it was found that the CO pathway
s 2
was partitioned to minimize water loss because g' was greater than g'. It was also shown
r s
that increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) tended to enhance the partitioning of the
stomatal conductance to g' at the expense of g' since stomates are more sensitive to VPD
r s
than are the reactions associated with g'.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Materials
In June of 1990 10 plants of each bluestem population (P.I. 237110 and Ganada)
were propagated from seed in 0.8-L plastic pots in the Tucson PMC greenhouse. Seed of
Ganada was received from the Los Lunas Plant Materials Center and seed of P.I. 237110
was harvested at the Tucson Plant Materials Center. Sixty-five grams of perlite was
placed in the bottom of each pot to allow for good drainage, on top of which was placed
200 g of commercial potting mix. Daytime temperatures in the greenhouse were
maintained between 32 and 35 ºC and nighttime temperatures were maintained between
24 and 27 ºC. The plants were watered twice a day (morning and afternoon) with an
automatic overhead mist system. No artificial lighting was used, however, the
greenhouse was covered with shade cloth that reduced the natural sunlight entering the
greenhouse by approximately 50%. These potted plants were used for all of the following
experiments except the WUE experiments. All experiments were organized in a
completely randomized design and were analyzed by analysis of variance. Probability
values of P≤0.05 were used in statistical analyses for all experiments.
Leaf Peels for Determining Stomate Densities
In November 1990 stomate densities of leaves from both yellow bluestem
populations were determined by taking leaf impressions from five randomly selected
plants of each population on leaves located in the lower, middle, and upper portions of
the plant canopies. Cellulose acetate was applied to the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces
as well as the sheaths. After allowing the cellulose acetate to dry it was removed with a
pair of tweezers and mounted onto microscope slides. The leaf peels were then viewed
under a microscope at 450X where the surface area viewed was 0.15 mm2 per microscope
field. Stomata in three separate fields were counted for each slide and stomate density
averages for each population were calculated.
Measurements of Apparent Photosynthesis Under Full Sunlight
Photosynthetic rates were measured using two specially constructed, air-tight,
plexiglass chambers that allowed atmospheric gases to circulate within a closed system.
This method is similar to one described by Clegg and Sullivan (1978). One of the
chambers was equipped with a battery-powered fan that facilitated the movement of gases
within the closed system. This chamber was called the "circulation chamber". This
