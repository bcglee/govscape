inches). Potential soils to which this cultivar is adapted to includes loamy sand, loamy
fine sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam and silt loam.
History:
In August 1989, a large-scale seed production block was established in Field, Borders 18
& 19 at the Tucson Plant Materials Center (Tucson PMC). Seed harvests were conducted
in the late spring and late fall using the Flail-Vac seed harvester.
Tucson PMC personnel also comparatively evaluated Bothriochloa ischaemum, P.I.
237110 and 'Ganada'. Evaluation factors included: germination rates under various
osmotic potentials, seedling vigor at various osmotic potentials, tolerance to drought-like
conditions, water use efficiency, stomate densities, leaf surface areas, specific leaf
weights, apparent photosynthetic rates, and dark respiration rates.
Results and Discussion:
This accession will not be released for commercial production due to a lack of interest by
customers for introduced species. Yellow bluestem has been and is currently being
studied extensively for use as a pasture grass in the southern Great Plains region of the
U.S. The following report summarizes the final evaluations conducted with this
accession.
