environments. They reported significant differences in WUE among selections within
environments. WUE values were reported as being lower for seedlings than mature
plants, yet the relative ranking of selections did not change over stages of maturity.
Selections with the lowest water use were determined to be the most drought tolerant at
the seedling stage. They also observed a significant negative association between
seedling WUE and seedling drought tolerance. The same association was shown to exist
for seedling drought tolerance and mature-plant WUE.
Wright and Dobrenz (1973) also studied WUE and its associated characteristics in
Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees). They found the two components of
WUE, transpired water and dry matter produced, varied significantly among the Lehmann
lovegrass lines. Their studies revealed that the lines with the highest production of dry
matter transpired the most water. They stated that WUE was not significantly associated
with the amount of transpired water but was significantly associated with the production
of dry matter. Individual measurements of these two components did not provide an
accurate estimate of WUE. However, the WUE values did demonstrate the
interrelationship of transpired water and the amount of dry matter produced. This study
demonstrated that the most water-use efficient plants produced about twice the amount of
total dry matter as the least-efficient plants. The desired performance is a minimum
amount of water used for maximum production which translates into superior efficiency
of water use.
Additional studies conducted by Wright and Dobrenz (1970a) on blue panicgrass
(Panicum antidotale Retz.) focused on determining the WUE of this species and relating
this to previous studies of blue panicgrass conducted by Wright (1962a, 1962b) which
revealed that blue panicgrass showed a relatively high tolerance to soil-moisture stress.
In studies by Wright and Dobrenz (1970), soil moisture levels ranged from 15 to 60 cm in
depth. WUE and root weight decreased when soil moisture stress increased, while the
dry weight of forage was unchanged. Two prominent findings were noted: (1) the most
efficient use of water and the highest level of forage production were achieved when
plants were clipped at a 30 cm height and when a majority of the seedheads had emerged
from the boot ("emergence-maturity stage"); and (2) the emergence-maturity stage gave
the highest forage and protein yield, which along with the 30-cm clipping height was the
superior management for efficient use of water.
Coyne and Bradford (1985) hypothesized that differences in morphology and
geographical origin of two accessions of eastern gamagrass [Tripsacum dactyloides (L.)
L.] might result in differences in photosynthesis and WUE that could be exploited in a
plant improvement program. This study showed that eastern gamagrass has
comparatively high photosynthetic rates and WUE when soil water is not limiting. It was
also stated that the differences in the measured physiological parameters between the two
gamagrass strains suggests that potential exists for germplasm enhancement with respect
to maintaining optimum performance in variable environments.
Coyne and Bradford (1985) also stated that the efficiency with which a plant fixes
C in relation to water loss is a function of the manner in which the CO pathway is
2
partitioned into its component conductances. Species having the C photosynthetic
4
pathway are generally considered to be more water use efficient than C species because
3
the C species have a higher ratio of residual conductance (g') to stomatal conductance
