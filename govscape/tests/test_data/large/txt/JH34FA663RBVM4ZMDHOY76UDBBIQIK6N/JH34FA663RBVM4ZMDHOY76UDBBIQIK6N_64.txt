dominant trees at lower elevations are Fremont cottonwood and Goodding willow. Also,
there are a fairly large proportion of cottonwoods mixed in with willows at elevations as
low as 122 m in areas along the Lower Colorado River (K. Bade, personal comm. 1993).
The focus of this review is on the lower elevation vegetation along the Lower Colorado
River. In this area, the plants of interest in the upland zone are Prosopis juliflora var.
Torreyana L. Benson (honey mesquite), P. Pubescens Benth. (screwbean mesquite) and
Atriplex lentiformis (Torr.) Wats. (Quailbush), rather than the higher elevation hackberry
or walnut. These plants, along with the streamside cottonwoods and willows, were found
to support the largest and most diverse wildlife populations. In comparison, Tamarix
chinensis (salt cedar), an invasive, non-native species, has invaded large areas formerly
occupied by cottonwoods and willows and has been found to have minimal value to
wildlife (Anderson and Ohmart 1985).
The Problem of Tamarix:
It is commonly agreed that salt cedar is very difficult to eradicate and can reseed or
resprout readily. Salt cedar is a non-native plant that is less useful to wildlife and utilizes
more water than native vegetation, and competes aggressively with native vegetation.
One large salt cedar plant can transpire about 757 liters of water per day (Duncan 1992).
Native plant species, such as quailbush, honey mesquite, and blue palo verde (Cercidium
floridum Bentham), all use and transpire less water per unit of occupied space than does
salt cedar (Anderson and Ohmart 1985).
According to Don Alam, district conservationist for the USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) in Artesia, NM, an estimated 1 million acres have been
overrun by this plant in California, Arizona, Texas and parts of Oklahoma, Colorado,
Utah and Nevada. The spread of salt cedar began when it was imported from North
Africa and the Middle East in the early 1800’s. A disturbing drop in groundwater levels
was associated with this plant by the 1940’s. In the Colorado River Basin, salt cedar
consumes more than 700 billion liters of water annually (DeBano and Schmidt 1989;
Duncan 1992). Salt cedar actually dries up natural wetlands according to Alam. It also
produces more than 500,000 seeds per plant per season and has proven itself to be highly
invasive.
Mature salt cedar plants can tolerate heat, high salinity, drought and can even be
submerged for more than 70 days and still survive. Early attempts at control by burning
only stimulated growth, root plowing knocked out less than half of the plants at average
cost of $700 per acre, and plowing increased erosion and destroyed other vegetation in
the area (Duncan 1992).
Herbicides may be the only effective control of salt cedar. One herbicide has recently
proven itself to be particularly useful. ARSENAL, a systemic herbicide produced by
American Cyanamid, works by inhibiting a vital plant enzyme and has been successfully
used by several researchers. There is little effect on non-plant species because it is
specific to plant metabolism, and it is effective at small application rates. On one test site
