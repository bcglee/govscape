resulting from an eradication program can be caused by multiple
treatments of the same area in the same season (that is, three applications
of B.t.k. in this program) and retreatment of the same project area in
following years. Cumulative impacts may be additive resulting in greater
effect than the sum of the individual effects.
The cumulative impacts in the proposed alternative could occur from the
three B.t.k. applications that extend the time of potential exposure and risk
to a greater number of non-target lepidopterans. However, because the
proposed eradication area is relatively small, the opportunity for
recolonization of non-target lepidopterans from the surrounding areas is
high.
Because both B.t.k. application and mass trapping have very little
potential for human and environmental effects, when the techniques are
used together they also have very little cumulative impact. B.t.k.
application used in conjunction with mass trapping poses little or no risk
to non-target organisms. The risk of cumulative impacts to humans, water
quality, microclimate, and soil productivity is minimal.
In the event that the gypsy moth outbreak establishes itself in this small
area, future treatments may be required to eliminate them. Spraying of
B.t.k. over several years may lead to decreased likelihood that non-target
lepidopterans reestablish populations in this area. However, if future
treatments are needed, a subsequent EA will be conducted and these risks
will be evaluated further.
B. Threatened and Endangered Species
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its implementing
regulations require Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened
species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat. APHIS has considered the potential effects of the proposed
program on endangered or threatened species and their habitats and
determined that no listed species is located within the area affected by the
eradication project proposed. Therefore, APHIS has made a no effect
determination for the proposed program for eradication of the gypsy moth
using B.t.k. and mass trapping in Orange County, California.
