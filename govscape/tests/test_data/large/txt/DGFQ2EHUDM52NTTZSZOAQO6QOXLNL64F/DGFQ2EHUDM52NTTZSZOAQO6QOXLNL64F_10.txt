Application of B.t.k. poses negligible risk to human health or the
environment. B.t.k.’s host range is limited to caterpillars of Lepidoptera
(moth and butterflies). The biological pesticide, B.t.k., is now commonly
the material of choice for gypsy moth eradication programs in the
United States. In the past decade, improved formulations and more
concentrated applications of B.t.k. have increased gypsy moth larval
mortality and have provided more consistent foliage protection where it
has been used. Aqueous B.t.k. formulations do not affect aquatic
organisms and can be applied over open water. B.t.k. is relatively
expensive because three applications are usually required to ensure
eradication.
If directly exposed to B.t.k. spray, some individuals (particularly workers

who handle or mix the pesticides) may develop minor irritation of the

skin, eyes, or respiratory tract. These effects are relatively mild and
transient. Pathogenic effects are not likely, even in individuals with
impaired immune systems. Allergic responses to B.t.k. are conceivable,
but have not been documented. Table 9–4 and figure 9–1, found in
appendix F of the 1995 Final EIS for Gypsy Moth Management in the
United States (USDA, 1995) clearly and concisely shows human risks due
to gypsy moth and all treatment alternatives including B.t.k.
In 1998, EPA published Reregistration Eligibility Decision Bacillus
thuringiensis (EPA 1998) in which the agency concluded:
“Based on the reviews of the generic data for the active ingredient,
Bacillus thuringiensis, the Agency has sufficient information on the health
effects of Bacillus thuringiensis and on its potential for causing adverse
effects in fish and wildlife and the environment. The Agency has
determined that Bacillus thuringiensis products, manufactured and used as
specified in this Reregistration Eligibility Decision will not pose
unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment.
Therefore, the Agency concludes that products containing Bacillus
thuringiensis for all uses are eligible for reregistration.”

theoretically, those animals dependent on caterpillars for food may be
affected. However, depressions in caterpillar populations are expected to
be temporary due to recolonization from adjacent areas and the high
reproductive capacity of most insects. B.t.k. is only effective against early
instars of caterpillars. Therefore, Lepidoptera larvae exposed in late
instars and those present at times other than during treatment applications
are not affected.
