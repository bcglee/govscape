adults. The sterile adults mate with fertile adults but viable offspring are
not produced. If successful, the effect is population reduction and
eventual elimination of the infestation.
Of the treatment options listed above, B.t.k. and diflubenzuron have
proven to be the most effective in situations such as the one in Orange
County. This EA analyzes the no action alternative and the proposed
action that will treat the area using B.t.k. in combination with mass
trapping. Other treatments were not considered in detail because the
probability that they would achieve the program goal of eradication was
judged to be too low or could not be determined. Diflubenzuron (Dimilin)
was not selected because the growth regulator has a broader non-target
host range than B.t.k. and can kill many other insects in addition to larvae
of moths and butterflies and is, therefore, not preferable unless B.t.k. is not
available. GypcheckÂ®, mating disruption, and sterile insect release are
still in a somewhat experimental stage of development for eradication
programs and the results have been variable.
A. No Action
Under this alternative, we would not treat the selected area with any
insecticide or mating disruption. This would allow any population of
gypsy moth within the area to become established and spread into the
surrounding areas. Although this does not meet the need to manage the
gypsy moth population, it does provide a baseline for comparison to the
alternatives.
B. Proposed Action
Under this alternative, a pesticide application of B.t.k. will be applied to
an area within a 200-meter radius from the capture site either by treating
the entire 200-meter block aerially or by treating only host material that
occurs within this 200-meter radius. There will be a total of three
applications with approximately a 10-day lapse in between the
applications. These applications are timed to occur during the early larval
stages when gypsy moth caterpillars hatch from their eggs and are most
susceptible to intoxication. The B.t.k. applications will be toxic to the
caterpillars of moths and butterflies that feed on treated vegetation within
the treatment zone, potentially eliminating any immature gypsy moths that
could be in the area.
Mass trapping will be used in conjunction with the B.t.k. treatment. Mass
trapping involves setting gypsy moth pheromone traps at very high
densities. These traps attract adult male gypsy moths. Mass trapping has
been attempted as an eradication tool but results have varied. This
