transition area, where the gypsy moth is spreading from the generally
infested area. The area where the gypsy moth is not established is called
the uninfested area. Isolated infestations resulting from accidental spread
of the gypsy moth by people may occur in the uninfested area. Different
management strategies apply in these areas: the suppression strategy is
employed in the generally infested area, the slow the spread strategy in the
transition area, and eradication of isolated infestations in the uninfested
area. In addition, for all infestations involving the Asian strain,
eradication is the preferred strategy in all locations, including the
generally infested area.
Recently an Asian gypsy moth was detected in Orange County, California.
Therefore, the proposed strategy for this isolated infestation of gypsy moth
is eradication.
III. Alternatives
In isolated infestations and any infestations that involve Asian gypsy moth
characteristics, as the one found in Orange County, California, eradication
is the strategy of choice. There are a number of treatment options, with
various levels of effectiveness, available to implement the strategy:
1) B.t.k. This is a biological insecticide containing the bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki. The insecticide is specifically
effective against caterpillars of many species of moths and butterflies.
2) Diflubenzuron (Dimilin). This is an insect growth regulator that
interferes with the growth of some immature insects.
3) Gypsy moth virus. This is a nucleopolyhedrosis virus which occurs
naturally and is specific to the gypsy moth. GypcheckÂ® is an insecticide
product made from the gypsy moth nucleopolyhedrosis virus.
4) Mass trapping. The treatment consists of large numbers of pheromone
traps used to attract male gypsy moths and prevent them from mating with
females, thereby causing a population reduction. Density of traps is nine
or more traps per acre.
5) Mating disruption. This treatment consists of aerially-applied tiny
plastic flakes or beads containing disparlure, a synthetic gypsy moth sex
pheromone. The pheromone confuses male moths and prevents them from
locating and mating with females.
6) Sterile insect releases. Large numbers of radiation-sterilized gypsy
moth eggs or pupae are released in a treatment area and develop into
