Egg masses and pupae of the gypsy moth can attach to nursery stock,
vehicles, camping equipment, and outdoor household articles that people
bring with them when they come to California. The presence of host
plants allows the gypsy moth to begin to establish new populations in
areas where they were previously unknown.
Gypsy moths originating in eastern North America that are progeny of the
original European introduction are sometimes referred to as North
American gypsy moths. Asian gypsy moths are a strain of the same
species that comes from eastern Russia and Asia. Asian gypsy moths have
also been established in Germany and other European countries where
they are interbreeding with North American gypsy moths.
Asian gypsy moths differ from North American gypsy moths in that the
female Asian gypsy moths can fly long distances. Female North
American gypsy moths, despite having fully developed wings, cannot fly.
In addition, the host species for Asian gypsy moth is approximately
500 species, as compared to 200 host species for the North American
gypsy moth, which contributes to the rationale for an aggressive
eradication response wherever an Asian gypsy moth is found. These
characteristics combine to make the Asian gypsy moth a threat to the
forest resources of North America. Generally, Federal policy has been to
eradicate Asian gypsy moths whenever they are found.
There is precedent for eradication of isolated populations of Asian and
North American gypsy moths if eradication efforts are swiftly employed,
as was demonstrated in North Carolina in 1993. A ship carrying military
cargo from Germany was found to be infested with large numbers of
gypsy moths, including flying female moths typical of the Asian strain.
The ship was sent back out to sea and the cargo was fumigated, but not
before large numbers of moths flew ashore. Hundreds of male moths were
trapped near the port facilities, along the shore and up to 25 miles inland.
Genetic testing indicated that both North American and Asian strain moths
were present, as well as some which were apparently mixed strains (N.C.
Dept. of Agric. 1994). An eradication program was quickly devised and
put into place, and the infestation was successfully eradicated before it
could become established.
Several other eradication attempts involving Asian gypsy moth were also
successful. In 2000, Washington State treated 725 acres successfully with
Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstak (B.t.k). Oregon successfully treated
910 acres with B.t.k. in 2001. More recently, Idaho used B.t.k. treatments
on 640 acres to successfully eradicate the Asian gypsy moth.
