I. Introduction and Need for the Proposal
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in cooperation with the California
Department of Agriculture, proposes to eradicate the Asian gypsy moth
(Lymantria dispar L.) infestation in a small area located in Orange
County, California. The alternatives being considered here have been
analyzed in detail in the 1995 Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
for Gypsy Moth Management in the United States. The findings of that
EIS regarding these alternatives will be summarized and incorporated, by
reference, into this environmental assessment (EA). The need for this
proposed action is based on the potential adverse ecological and economic
impacts of gypsy moth infestations on the infested and surrounding areas.
This EA is tiered to USDA’s 1995 Final EIS for Gypsy Moth Management
in the United States. Eradication is proposed because of the isolated
nature of the infestation in Los Angeles County. This site-specific EA is
designed to examine the environmental consequences of a range of
treatment options under the 1995 Final EIS for Gypsy Moth Management
in the United States that may accomplish the program’s goals.
This EA is prepared consistent with National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) and APHIS’ NEPA implementing procedures (7 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), part 372), for the purpose of evaluating how the
proposed action and alternatives described in the proceedings sections, if
implemented, may affect the quality of the human environment.
A. Biology of Gypsy Moth
The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L., is one of the worst pests of trees
and shrubs in the United States. It was originally imported into
Massachusetts from Europe in 1869 for silk production experiments.
Some moths were accidentally released and became established. This
gypsy moth infestation has spread relentlessly and now covers the entire
northeastern part of the United States from Maine south to North Carolina,
and west to Michigan and Wisconsin. Gypsy moth caterpillars alter
ecosystems and disrupt human lives when in high numbers. Heavy
infestations cause defoliation and tree mortality. Defoliated trees are also
vulnerable to other insects and diseases that may kill them. Heavy
defoliation alters wildlife habitat, changes water quality, reduces property
and esthetic values, and reduces the recreational value of forested areas.
When present in large numbers, gypsy moth caterpillars can be a nuisance,
as well as a hazard, to health and safety (USDA, 1995).
