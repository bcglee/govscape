C. Site Specific Concerns
The treatment site is mainly residential. Only a small area will be
subjected to B.t.k. and, if applied by ground application, only host trees
within the area will be sprayed thus limiting exposure to humans. Citizens
will be on notice regarding the timing of the application of chemicals. It is
advised that individuals stay indoors during the application of these
chemicals to ensure that any negative effects are limited. Sensitive
individuals should be more aware of when the application occurs and to
limit their exposure.
Consistent with Executive Order (EO) 12898, AFederal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income
Populations,@ APHIS considered the potential for disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects on any minority or
low-income populations. The environmental and health effects from the
proposed applications are minimal and are not expected to have
disproportionate adverse effects to any minority or low-income
population.
Consistent with EO 13045, AProtection of Children From Environmental
Health Risks and Safety Risks,@ APHIS considered the potential for
disproportionately high and adverse environmental health and safety risks
to children. The children in the area are not adversely affected
disproportionately over adults from the program actions proposed.
