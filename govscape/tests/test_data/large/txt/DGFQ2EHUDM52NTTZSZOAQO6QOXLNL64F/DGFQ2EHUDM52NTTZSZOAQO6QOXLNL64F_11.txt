There are no known effects from B.t.k. to mammals, amphibians, birds, or
reptiles. Water quality and soil conditions should not be directly affected
by B.t.k. B.t.k. is not likely to affect most aquatic organisms and
naturally occurs in soils worldwide. B.t.k. reduces the amount of
defoliation by leaf-eating caterpillars; therefore, changes in microclimate
due to defoliation are not expected after B.t.k. application.
Mass Trapping
Intensive mass trapping involves the use of large numbers of disparlure-
baited pheromone traps. Disparlure is a chemical sex attractant that
attracts male gypsy moths. Section 5 from appendix G of the 1995 Final
EIS for Gypsy Moth Management in the United States thoroughly
discussed the ecological effects of disparlure, B.t.k., and other treatment
options on the environment.
1. Human Data are not sufficient for a quantitative risk assessment. By analogy to
Environment other insect pheromones, risks of toxic effects, if any, are likely to be
slight for the general public and workers. Disparlure is very persistent on
and in the body. Individuals exposed to disparlure may attract adult male
moths for prolonged periods of time (up to 2 to 3 years). This may be a
considerable nuisance in gypsy moth infested areas such as the eastern
United States. The level of exposure required to cause the attractant effect
cannot be characterized, although the likelihood of this effect is much
greater for workers than for the general public. However, exposure to
disparlure from mass trapping is unlikely and would only occur if
someone were to tamper with the trap themselves.
In acute toxicity tests, disparlure was not toxic to mammals, birds, or fish.
2. Ecological
Pheromone traps do catch small numbers of non-target organisms.
Environment
However, since the pheromone in the trap is specific to gypsy moth, the
number of non-target organisms affected will be very small and will have
a minimal impact to the environment.
V. Other Issues
A. Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts are defined as “the impact on the environment which
results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what
agencies or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can
result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking
place over a period of time” (40 CFR § 1508.7). Cumulative impacts
