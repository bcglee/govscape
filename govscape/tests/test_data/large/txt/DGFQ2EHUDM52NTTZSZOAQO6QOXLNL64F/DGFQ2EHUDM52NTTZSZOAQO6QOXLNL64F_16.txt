Finding of No Significant Impact for
Asian Gypsy Moth Cooperative Eradication Program
Orange County, CA
Environmental Assessment
March 2006
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for its participation in the eradication
of the gypsy moth population in Orange County, CA. The EA, incorporated by reference into
this document, is tiered to the AFinal Environmental Impact Statement for the Gypsy Moth
Management in the United States: A Cooperative Approach.@ This EA is available from:
U.S. Department of Agriculture or U.S. Department of Agriculture
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
Plant Protection and Quarantine 650 Capitol Mall, Suite 6â€“400
Program Support Sacramento, CA 95814
4700 River Road, Unit 134
Riverdale, MD 20737
The EA analyzed the following alternatives: no action and the proposed action which uses a
combination of the pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and mass trapping. The
proposed action was preferred because of its ability to achieve the eradication objective in a
way that minimizes potential environmental consequences and provides the most opportunity
for successful eradication.
APHIS has determined that there would be no significant impact to the human environment
from the implementation of the proposed program. APHIS= Finding of No Significant Impact
for this program was based upon its analysis of the program=s characteristics and its anticipated
environmental consequences, as analyzed in the EA. APHIS has considered the potential
effects on endangered and threatened species and their critical habitats, and has made a no
effect determination.
I find that the proposed program will pose no disproportionate adverse effects to minority and
low-income populations and the actions undertaken for this program are entirely consistent
with the principles of Aenvironmental justice,@ as expressed in Executive Order 12898, and the
protection of children, as expressed in Executive Order 13045. Lastly, because I have not
found evidence of a significant environmental impact associated with the proposed program, I
further find that an environmental impact statement does not need to be prepared and that the
proposed program may be implemented.
