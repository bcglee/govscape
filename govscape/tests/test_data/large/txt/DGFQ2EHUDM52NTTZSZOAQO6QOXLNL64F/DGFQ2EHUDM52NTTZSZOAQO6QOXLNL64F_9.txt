gypsy moth defoliation. Gypsy moth feeding can lead to changes in forest
stand composition. Nesting sites and cover would be reduced. Although
major water sources are not located within the treatment site, if gypsy
moths were to spread to other areas changes in water quality and effects to
aquatic organisms would be seen. The loss of vegetation in the area could
lead to increased erosion of soil and loss of moisture retention.
B. Proposed Action
The proposed action will utilize B.t.k pesticide in a 200-meter radius zone
surrounding the location of the gypsy moth find. B.t.k. will either be
applied aerially or by ground equipment. If applied aerially, the entire
200-meter radius area will be treated. If applied by ground equipment,
only those preferred hosts that occur in the area will be sprayed. Mass
trapping will be used outside the 200-meter radius zone to attract male
gypsy moths thus preventing them from mating. The traps will be placed
at a density of 10 per acre in the zone, extending from 200 meters from the
Asian gypsy moth capture site outward to cover 1-square mile. Outward
from the 1-square mile area, traps will be placed at the rate of 25 per
square mile to cover an area of 5 square miles around the capture site.
B.t.k.
B.t.k. is a naturally occurring soil bacterium. When sprayed on foliage
and ingested, it is toxic to most caterpillars (larvae of butterflies and
moths). Other insects and vertebrates are not affected by this bacterium.
Human health risks from use of B.t.k. in gypsy moth eradication programs
have been shown to be extremely low. There are no known effects to
mammals, amphibians, birds, or reptiles.
Modern aqueous formulations of B.t.k. contain no organic solvents. None
of the inert ingredients in these formulations are on list 1 (Inerts of
Toxicological Concern) of the Environmental Protection (EPA) or list 2
(Potentially Toxic Inerts). In addition, all of the inert ingredients are
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in foods or in food
processing. B.t.k. products are organic and are designated by EPA as
exempt from residue tolerances. This means that there are no limitations
on the amount of residue that exists on food items. B.t.k can be used on
food crops up to and including the day these products are harvested, as
well as on stored food products. Some genetically modified crops, such as
corn, now have B.t.k. genes permanently incorporated in them. All
sensitive terrestrial insects are Lepidoptera and include some species of
butterfly. The risk characterization for other wildlife species is
unambiguous under foreseeable conditions of exposure; however, adverse
effects are unlikely to occur.
