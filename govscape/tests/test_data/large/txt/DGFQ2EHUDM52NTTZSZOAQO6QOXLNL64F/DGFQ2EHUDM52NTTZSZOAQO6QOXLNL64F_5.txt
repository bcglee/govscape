B. Affected Environment
The Asian gypsy moth was found at the capture site at 1905 W. Martha
Lane, Santa Ana, California with coordinates at 33 degrees 45’ 32.49” N.
and 118 degrees 17’ 46.36” W. The area surrounding the capture site is
mostly residential. Within the 200-meter radius treatment zone, there is a
total of 148 residences. There are no businesses or schools within the 200-
meter radius treatment zone, however, there is a preschool 1/2 block away
from the 200-meter zone and an elementary school and city park 3/4
blocks away from the 200-meter zone. The area outside the 200-meter
zone and up to a 0.5 mile radius from the capture site includes 1412 total
residences, 51 businesses, and one junior college with a separate preschool
facility.
C. Need for Action
One male Asian gypsy moth was found in a trap in a residential area in
Orange County, California. This find suggests that there may be a
population of Asian gypsy moths in this area of California. This
population of Asian gypsy moth in California needs to be eradicated to
avoid potential ecological or human impacts. Orange County contains
preferred host plants that are susceptible to defoliation by the gypsy moth
which, therefore, could support successful reproduction and spread of the
pest. If the Asian gypsy moth becomes established and spreads
throughout Orange County and to other areas in California, the associated
damage, defoliation, and mortality from such an occurrence, in the
absence of timely eradication action, could be devastating. Asian gypsy
moth is not known to be established in the United States, and the proposed
eradication treatment is the recommended response for the detection of
this pest in Orange County.
II. Proposed Action
Under the Record of Decision of the EIS, the selected alternative was to
use a variety of treatment options to further three strategies (slow the
spread, suppression, and eradication). Each strategy would be applied,
depending on the geography of the area to be treated, relative to the
generally infested gypsy moth area. Eradication is the preferred strategy
when the presence of an Asian gypsy moth is found, as is the case in
Los Angeles County.
The following is a description of geography in United States with regard
to the gypsy moth. The area of the United States where the North
American strain of the gypsy moth is established is called the generally
infested area. Next to this area is a band 50 to 100 miles wide, called the
