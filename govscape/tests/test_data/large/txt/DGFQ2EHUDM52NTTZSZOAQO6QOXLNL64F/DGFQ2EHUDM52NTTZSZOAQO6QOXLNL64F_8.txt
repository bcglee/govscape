technique may be useful as an eradication tool when used in combination
with other techniques. Any captured male moths are removed from the
breeding population. Traps will be placed outside the 200-meter radius
B.t.k. treatment area. Ten traps per acre will be placed within a 0.5 mile
radius from capture site. Outside of the 1-mile core, 25 traps will be
placed per square mile. Inspections of the traps will occur on a regular
schedule, typically 1 week.
IV. Environmental Impacts of the
Proposed Action and Alternatives
A. No Action
The no action alternative is required by Council of Environmental Quality
regulations (40 CFR §1502.14(d)). The no action alternative forms the
basis for a comparison among the effects of the different alternatives.
This alternative provides baseline information for understanding
environmental impacts associated with the no action alternative and
potential environmental effects associated with the outbreak from a non-
native species.
Selecting this alternative would result in the establishment of a gypsy
moth population with commensurate damage to trees relative to the level
of infestation. This would allow the gypsy moth to establish in the area
and expand into the surrounding area. The majority of the trees in the
eradication area and surrounding areas are susceptible to damage from
feeding of the gypsy moth. The alternative would allow the gypsy moth to
flourish in the existing area and continue to spread into surrounding areas.
With the establishment of the gypsy moth, the environmental concerns
discussed below would be likely to occur.
1. Human Some people are allergic to the tiny hairs on gypsy moth caterpillars.
Environment These people would suffer minor allergic reactions, primarily rashes, if
gypsy moths were allowed to become established. In addition, irritation to
eyes and throat are common reactions in treating infested outbreaks.
During outbreaks, gypsy moth caterpillars crawl over sidewalks, patios,
lawn furniture, and the like, and they may even enter houses. In heavily
infested areas, large numbers of caterpillars limit some people’s
enjoyment of the outdoors. The droppings and defoliation are not
aesthetically pleasing to those involved in recreational activities.
