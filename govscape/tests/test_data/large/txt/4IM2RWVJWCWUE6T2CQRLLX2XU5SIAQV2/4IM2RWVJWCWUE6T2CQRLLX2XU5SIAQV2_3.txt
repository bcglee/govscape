In one study, growth data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were
analyzed. Height and weight of participating children in the study were measured at seven different ages: 24, 36, 54 months and 7, 9, 11 and 12 years.
Children who were ever above average weight (greater than the 85th percentile) one time at ages 24, 36, or 54 months during the preschool ages were
more than five times as likely to be overweight at age 12 than those who were below the 85th percentile for BMI at all three of the preschool ages. During
the elementary school period, ages 7, 9, and 11 years, the more times a child was overweight, the greater the odds of being overweight at age 12 years
compared to a child who was never overweight. A child who was overweight once while at elementary school was 25 times more likely to be overweight
at 12, compared to a child who was never overweight while at elementary school.6
Another study chose to use the term obese instead of overweight to describe children above the 95th percentile. This research examined the relationship
between obesity in childhood and obesity in adulthood by reviewing the epidemiologic literature published between 1970 and July 1992. For all studies
and across all ages, the risk of adult obesity was at least twice as high for obese children as for nonobese children. The risk of adult obesity
was greater for children who were at higher levels of obesity and for children who were obese at older ages. 7 PAGE
