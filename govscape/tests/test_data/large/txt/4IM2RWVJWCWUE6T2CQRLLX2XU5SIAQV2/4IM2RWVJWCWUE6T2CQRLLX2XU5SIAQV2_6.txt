BMI alone is not a diagnostic tool. For example, a child may have a high BMI for age and sex, but to determine if excess fat is a
problem, a health care provider would need to decide. It is important for the child to be seen by a health care provider because there
are various health concerns associated with weight gain. The provider will evaluate height and weight independently using the CDC
2 to 20 years Weight-for-age and Stature-for-age growth charts to determine if changes in weight or height had a greater impact on
the BMI. A health care provider may also check skin fold thickness measurements, evaluated the diet, physical activity, family history,
and perform other appropriate health screenings. The goal for overweight children and adolescents is to reduce the rate of weight
gain while allowing normal growth and development.
