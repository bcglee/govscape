For population assessment, calculating BMI is one of the best methods of evaluating overweight and obesity trends over time. Calculation requires only height
and weight. It is inexpensive and easy to use for clinicians and for the general public. The use of BMI allows people to compare their own weight status to that
of the general population. Research has shown that BMI correlates to direct measures of body fat, such as underwater weighing and more advanced
measures of body fat.1,2
