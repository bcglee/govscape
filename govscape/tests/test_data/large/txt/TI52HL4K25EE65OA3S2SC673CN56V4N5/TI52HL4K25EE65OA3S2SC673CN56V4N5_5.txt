Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
should be considered in determining whether minimum habitat requirements for wild turkeys can be
met for the planning area.
Avian Diseases - Disease is a natural occurrence in many species of wildlife. Although not common, wild turkeys can suffer
from diseases including avian pox and blackhead. Avian pox can affect nearly any bird species and mostly affects the unfeath-
ered parts of the wild turkey. Physical characteristics of avian pox in wild turkeys include wart-like lesions on the head, feet,
and legs. Emaciated turkeys, or individuals displaying weakness, respiratory distress, or blindness may be suffering from avian
pox. Although unsightly, avian pox does not pose a threat to humans and animals infected can be safely cleaned and consumed
if harvested. Blackhead disease causes similar characteristics in wild turkeys along with lethargy, drooping wings, and head held
close to the body. Yellowish-colored droppings and necrosis of the liver are other characteristics of blackhead disease. Black-
head disease is transmitted through roundworms that host Histomonas protozoa. Chickens and wild pheasants act as hosts for
Histomonas protozoa. Wild turkeys should be kept from contact with domestic chickens, and chicken manure from poultry op-
erations should not be used as fertilizer in fields frequented by wild turkeys. Pen-raised pheasants may spread Histomonas if
introduced into wild turkey range. As a precaution, lethargic wild turkeys should be avoided.
Limiting Factors
For planning purposes, assess the site to subjectively rate the availability and quality of wild turkey
habitat within a planning area, based on descriptions of the above habitat requirements. Habitat com-
munities and components that are absent or rated low are likely limiting wild turkey habitat quality.
Small landowners are more likely to have limiting factors on their property. However, this should not
discourage them from managing for wild turkeys. Land uses on adjacent properties should be consid-
ered to accurately rate the quality of one’s property as wild turkey habitat, and management goals
should focus on improving habitat components not found nearby.

Wild Turkey Habitat Management
Management practices to create, enhance, or maintain wild turkey habitat are listed below. More than
one practice may be beneficial in an area depending on the primary land use. The area’s size, man-
agement goals, vegetation composition, and geographic region may dictate which management prac-
tices are most appropriate. Consultation with and assistance from federal, state or local fish and wild-
life and land management agencies can be helpful in identifying appropriate management actions.
Plantings - When planted in open fields and along field borders, within woodlands and corridors con-
necting existing habitat patches, and in streamside riparian areas and utility line rights-of-way, the
following plant species may improve wild turkey food and cover habitat components. However, care
should be taken when selecting species to plant to ensure that plantings are compatible with native
ecosystems. For example, establishing trees in historically grassland areas may decrease habitat qual-
ity for grassland-nesting birds and other wildlife associated with native grassland communities. To-
pography and climate also influence which species are appropriate for planting; the assistance of local
