Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
Range
The wild turkey can today be found in suitable habitat in each of the lower 48 United States and Ha-
waii. Populations are the most numerous in Texas at more than 600,000 birds, followed in descending
order by Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wiscon-
sin, California, Iowa, Florida, Tennessee, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Virginia with populations
between 145,000 and 600,000 birds; the remaining 32 states host smaller populations. Wild turkeys
are non-migratory, year-round residents. Habitat composition and local weather patterns dictate where
turkeys are found within each state.

Habitat Requirements
General
The five wild turkey subspecies occupy a variety of habitats throughout their ranges. The following
table lists the primary habitats occupied by wild turkeys in their respective regions.
Primary habitats occupied by wild turkey subspecies
Species Primary Habitats Occupied
Eastern wild turkey open, mature hardwood and mixed forests; open fields
Rio Grande wild turkey brushy areas near streams and rivers; mesquite, pine and scrub oak forests
Merriam’s wild turkey ponderosa pine forests; pinyon-juniper woodlands; foothills and other
mountain forest habitats
Florida wild turkey pine flatwoods, oak and palmetto hammocks; wooded swamp habitats;
prairies adjacent to roosting trees
Gould’s wild turkey mountainous regions characterized by steep, rocky canyons and brushy
chaparral; pinyon pine and juniper forest; oak savanna
Careful planning to maintain adequate roosting trees and mid-to late-successional forest communities
is necessary to provide suitable habitat for woodland wild turkeys. Development, overgrazing by live-
stock, lack of mature forest or roost trees, and a lack of brood habitat (open areas with herbaceous
cover) can all limit wild turkey populations. Properly managing woodlands, grazed pasturelands, and
