Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
land management personnel can be helpful in determining where plantings would be most beneficial.
Various agencies may be able to provide seed, planting equipment, and technical advice on planting.

Timber Management â€“ Properties managed for timber
can be enhanced for wild turkeys by managing tracts to
contain trees of various ages (uneven-aged management)
and creating travel corridors between wooded tracts.
Even-aged management can also provide a variety of
food and cover resources where timber stands are divided
into smaller stands and a variety of age classes occur in
close proximity to one another. Clearcutting small
blocks, selective tree harvesting, stand thinning, and pre-
scribed burning can be used within a forested tract to cre-
ate a mosaic of habitats. Areas in which clearcutting is
the most feasible harvesting technique can be made more conducive to wild turkeys by dividing a har-
vest tract into separate stands and conducting rotational clearcuts (5-7 years for pines and 10-15 years
for hardwoods) among stands. Where possible, selective harvesting of trees can open the forest can-
opy enough to stimulate growth of understory forbs and shrubs. Mast-producing trees such as oaks
and black cherry should be left during selective harvesting. Prescribed burning can clear slash and
downed trees from the understory of coniferous forests and open the forest floor to promote new
growth of valuable shrub and forb species. Burning should be conducted with assistance from local
