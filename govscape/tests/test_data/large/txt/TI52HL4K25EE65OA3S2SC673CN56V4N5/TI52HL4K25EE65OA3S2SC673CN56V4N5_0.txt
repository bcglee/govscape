General Information
The wild turkey is a large, gallinaceous game bird repre-
sented by five subspecies throughout the United States.
Its large size, iridescent body feathers and gregarious be-
havior has made the wild turkey a popular symbol of
American wildlife for centuries. The wild turkey’s repu-
tation as a keen and wary game bird of exceptional table
fare, its fascinating courting behavior, and its photogenic
qualities have made it one of the most desirable species
of native wildlife among hunters and other wildlife en-
thusiasts. The wild turkey’s popularity prompted one of
Wildlife Habitat Council the most successful wildlife management recovery efforts
ever conducted in the United States.
Wild turkey populations experienced heavy pressure from unregulated hunting following the arrival of
Europeans in North America. Loss of habitat associated with forest clearing further impacted turkey
populations, beginning in the late 1600s. By 1920, wild turkeys remained in only 21 of 39 states that
historically supported healthy populations. Fortunately, regeneration of harvested forests and intensive
habitat management efforts have greatly improved wild turkey populations in areas within its tradi-
tional range. Turkeys have been introduced to areas outside their historical range and, due to their
adaptability, have thrived. As a result, wild turkeys are present today in all states except Alaska.
Continued efforts to increase wild turkey populations on private lands may help to further secure a sta-
ble future for this valued game bird.
This leaflet is designed to serve as an introduction
to the habitat requirements of the wild turkey in the
United States and to assist landowners and manag-
ers in the development of a comprehensive wild
turkey management plan. The success of any spe-
cies management plan depends on considering the
specific needs of the desired species and analyzing
the designated habitat area as a whole to ensure that
all required habitat elements are present. This
leaflet provides a number of practical habitat man-
agement activities that can be conducted on private
lands to boost local wild turkey populations and
encourages involving fish and wildlife profession- Wild Turkey Range
als in management planning to identify additional
management actions needed over time.
