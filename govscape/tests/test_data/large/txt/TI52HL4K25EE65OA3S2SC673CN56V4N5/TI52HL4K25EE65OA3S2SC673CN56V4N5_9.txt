Available Assistance
Landowners interested in making their individual efforts more valuable to the community can work
with the Wildlife Habitat Council and NRCS to involve school, scout, and community groups and their
families, as well as state and federal fish and wildlife agency personnel, in habitat projects when possi-
ble. On-site education programs demonstrating wild turkey habitat management can greatly increase
the value of an individual management project. Corporate landowners should encourage interested
employees to become involved. Involving federal, state and non-profit conservation agencies and or-
ganizations in the planning and operation of a wild turkey management plan can greatly improve the
projectâ€™s success. Assistance programs available through various sources are listed below.
