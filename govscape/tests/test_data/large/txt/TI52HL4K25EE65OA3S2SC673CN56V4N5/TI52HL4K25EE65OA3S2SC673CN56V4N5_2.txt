Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
open areas can help landowners boost local wild turkey populations as well as populations of other
species that rely on similar habitat.
Food
Wild turkeys forage throughout the day, but most feeding activity occurs during the first two to three
hours after leaving the roost at daybreak and two to three hours before sunset. Wild turkey diets are
composed mostly of plant foods. Ten to 20 percent of the diet consists of animal matter, primarily in
the form of insects. Insects are of critical importance to young wild turkeys (poults), and poult sur-
vival will be low in habitats that do not support insects. Food items consumed are diverse as a result of
the wild turkey’s extensive range, and availability of food items is dependent on season and geographic
region. Being opportunistic feeders, wild turkey diets are largely a function of the acceptable food
items available.

*Grit (course seeds and small pebbles) from spring seeps and ground foraging is a critical digestive component of the diet.
*Frogs, salamanders, toads, lizards, snakes, fiddler crabs and other small vertebrates and invertebrates are occasionally
consumed.
Nesting Cover
General nesting requirements of each wild turkey subspecies are listed in the following table. Shallow
nest depressions in the soil surface are either scratched by the female or formed through egg laying ac-
tivity at the nest site. Forest-nesting turkeys commonly nest in close proximity to openings and edges
