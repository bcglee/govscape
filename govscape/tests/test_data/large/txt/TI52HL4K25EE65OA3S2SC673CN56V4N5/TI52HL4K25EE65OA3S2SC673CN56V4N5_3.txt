Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
where poults have access to insect foods shortly after hatching. Each subspecies generally prefers
dense ground vegetation (14 to 16 inches in height) next to nesting cover. Because topography and
vegetation structure vary greatly throughout the wild turkey’s range, habitat not typically associated
with a subspecies’ nesting activities may occasionally be used. Therefore, the table below only lists
preferred habitat and cover types commonly used by each subspecies for nesting; other site conditions
may also provide suitable nesting habitat.
Nesting cover for wild turkeys
Species Nesting cover
Eastern wild turkey Nests on ground in hardwood or mixed-forested stand, at base of siz-
able trees within dense understory, under a brush or slash pile, in
thickets of greenbrier or downed trees and branches
Rio Grande wild turkey Nests on ground amidst mesquite, prickly pear, lantana, native
bluestems and muhly grasses.
Merriam’s wild turkey Nests on ground in mixed conifer stands (usually containing Ponder-
osa pine), blue spruce/bluegrass communities, and on moderately
steep east or northeast slopes.
Florida wild turkey Nests on ground in prairies, cypress, palmetto, and wire grass stands
and under brushy cover.
Gould’s wild turkey Nests on ground in forests at base of trees (oaks) and yucca plants.
Tends to nest on steep slopes with a northeastern exposure.
Roosting Cover
Wild turkeys roost on the ground and in trees. Tom
and hen turkeys without broods roost overnight in
trees to avoid predators. Tree roost habitat is found
within continuous stands of timber. It is ideally
comprised of mature, open-crowned trees with
branches spaced at least 18 inches apart that run par-
allel to the ground, having trunk diameters of 14
inches or greater, and located within one-half mile of
a food source. Mature pine, cypress, cottonwood and
oak trees can provide good roosting cover. Ground
roosting is most critical to hen turkeys during the
first three to four weeks of brood-rearing, after which
time poults are able to roost in trees with the hen.
Hens with young roost under large trees within for-
ests containing a dense understory of young trees and
shrubs, downed trees, rock outcrops, and brushy
vegetation. Various types of dense vegetation that adequately conceal the birds are commonly used as
ground roosting cover.
Brood-rearing cover
A lack of suitable brood habitat can severely affect wild turkey population recruitment, as brood habi-
tat plays a key role in the survival of poults during the first eight weeks of life. Open riparian wood-
lands, savannas, and forest openings of one-half to three acres in size provide good brood habitat.
These habitats best suit wild turkeys when they contain a multitude of nutritive, herbaceous forage that
supports insects (especially legumes), permits efficient poult foraging throughout the day, and provides
cover that enables poults and hens to see and hide from oncoming predators.

Forests with mature mast-producing trees and a
diversity of understory vegetation provide nesting,
roosting, and foraging opportunities for wild turkeys.
