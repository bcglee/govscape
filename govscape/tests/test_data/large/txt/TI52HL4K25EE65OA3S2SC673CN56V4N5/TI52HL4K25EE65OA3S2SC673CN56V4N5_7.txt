Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
forest and wildlife agency personnel and licensed burners. Thinning of stands can open a forest can-
opy and encourage new growth of understory forbs, grasses, and mast-producing and other food plants.
Connecting forested habitat patches is essential to enable wildlife to travel from one stand to another.
Timber harvest activities should leave travel corridors of standing trees at least 100 feet wide between
unharvested stands. Properties not managed for timber should connect fragmented turkey habitat when
possible with tree plantings.
Riparian zones - Riparian zones (streamside woody habitat) provide wild turkeys with roosting and
brood-rearing cover, food, and water resources. Riparian zones within a managed forest can be main-
tained by leaving a buffer of undisturbed trees and vegetation at least 100 feet on either side of streams
or seeps. Harvest of mature, mast-producing trees should not occur in riparian zones. Trees in riparian
zones should be left undisturbed, and these areas should be protected from cattle grazing until July to
allow for brood-rearing to conclude. Prescribed fire can be used cautiously in riparian zones when
vegetation is dormant.
Rights-of-way – Powerline and gasline rights-of-way (ROWs) provide open areas within wooded and
other habitats in which wild turkeys can court, rear young, forage and travel. While most ROWs are
maintained by utility companies, private landowners can work in cooperation with these companies to
manage ROWs for wildlife. ROWs can be enhanced by planting grass/legume mixtures, native forbs,
and other food plants such as lespedezas and sunflowers. Disking strips along ROW edges or across
dense ROWs to a depth of four to six inches can promote growth of native forbs such as smartweeds,
ragweeds, and milkweed when done on a two to three year rotational basis in early spring and late
summer. Spot herbicide application can help open ROWs by removing individual trees and shrubs of
little value to wild turkeys while preserving mast-producing species. Delaying mowing until after
August 1 will minimize the number of poults killed by mowing activities. Contact the utility company
to coordinate development of a ROW vegetation management plan for turkeys and other wildlife.
Spring seeps – In many forested areas, wild turkeys
use spring seeps as a reliable source of surface wa-
ter. Immature trees lining seeps can be thinned to
open the area surrounding the seep and promote
growth of grasses and increase vegetative diversity.
Mature mast-producing trees along seeps should
not be disturbed, and a buffer of undisturbed vege-
tation of at least 50 feet wide should be maintained
around seeps in areas where farming practices, live-
stock grazing, or timber harvesting occurs. Fencing
of livestock may be necessary to protect seeps and
riparian zones in pasturelands. Oaks, serviceberry,
and other fruit and seed-producing trees and shrubs
can be planted around open or old field seeps to
provide food, and immature or less-valuable tree
species can be girdled to create snags and maintain the area in an early developmental stage.
Management Prescriptions
Management treatments should address the habitat components that are determined to be limiting wild
turkey habitat potential. For planning purposes, select among the possible action items listed below to
raise the quality or availability of each habitat component determined to be limiting. NRCS conserva-
