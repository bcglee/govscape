Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)
Forest Cover
Common to each of the subspecies is their use of trees and forest habitat to fulfill various food and
cover needs. The table below lists the preferred tree species and other habitat types and vegetation
communities used by each subspecies of wild turkey. However, because wild turkeys are very adapt-
able and will use a wide variety of available habitats and tree species, the table does not provide a
complete list of all habitat types used by each subspecies.
Tree species and habitat communities used by wild turkeys

ash. ture riparian areas; bald cypress, tupelo, and water ash

turkey Conifer species: pinyon pine, junipers. pinyon pine, and juniper
Water
Wild turkeys drink water from spring seeps, streams, ponds, lakes, and livestock watering sources. A
source of open water is necessary to support a wild turkey population.
Interspersion of Habitat Components
The most critical aspect of wild turkey management is creating good interspersion or mixture of differ-
ent habitat types. Suitable foraging, nesting, brood-rearing, and roosting cover and a water source each
located within close proximity to one another is essential to attract wild turkeys to and maintain exist-
ing populations in an area. Depending upon the area, combinations of open, mature, mast-producing
hardwood forests; hardwood/conifer-mixed forests; understory tree and shrub species of varying ages
and sizes; hardwood hammocks; high elevation pinyon-juniper habitat; and cypress and tupelo swamps
interspersed with open clearings in the form of glades of grasslands, prairies, savanna and mature ri-
parian bottomlands can create ideal interspersion of habitats. Lack of diversity of these habitat types
within an area could reduce the area’s value to wild turkeys.
Minimum Habitat Area
The home range of a wild turkey flock ranges between 350 acres to over 60,000 acres. However, a
smaller tract of land that contains a mixture of the necessary habitat components may support wild tur-
keys better than a larger area that lacks one or more of the needed habitat components. Landowners
owning as few as 10 acres can manage for wild turkeys if one or more of the habitat requirements (e.g.,
nesting cover, brood range, roosting cover) is present on the property and adjacent lands provide other
habitat components needed to sustain turkeys. Therefore, lands outside the immediate planning area
