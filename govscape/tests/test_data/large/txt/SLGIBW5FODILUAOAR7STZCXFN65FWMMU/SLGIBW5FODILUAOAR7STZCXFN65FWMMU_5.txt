Sampling Date
FIG. 1. The effect of N treatment and year on N uptake of whole potato plants. The vertical
lines represent the standard error of the means within a sampling date and year.
The largest portion of the plant-assimilated 15N was found in the vegetative
portions at the early samplings. Most of this N appeared to be translocated
to the tubers during the remainder of the growing season. Approximately
88%, 88%, 84%, and 84% of the recovered fertilizer N was found in the
tubers in September for the 1978 preplant, 21 June 1978, 2 August 1978,
and 11 August 1980 applications, respectively.
Petiole NO3-N concentrations dropped rapidly after early tuber set
(:=1', 20 June) for the control and preplant N treatments (Figure 3). The 1978
seasonal N treatment (#3) maintained petiole NO3-N concentrations between
6-10,000 mg kg-1, while the combined preplant and seasonal N treatment
(#2) in 1980 kept the petiole NO3-N concentration above 17,000 mg kg-1.
