FIG. 3. The effect of N treatment and year on petiole NOa-N concentrations at selected
sampling dates.
A preliminary study showed that potato petiole NO3-N concentrations
increased from 3,000 to 20,200 mg kg-1 six days after a 45 kg N ha- 1
application as urea on 20 June. A change of 10,000 mg kg-i NO3-N in the
potato petioles and stems would be equivalent to a total N content change of
about 22 kg ha-1 in the plant. Rapid plant NO3-N uptake and temporary
storage in the petioles and stems may account for part of the high seasonal N
recoveries. Similar recoveries might also be expected for urea-ammonium
nitrate solutions applied during active tuber growth.
The petiole NO3-N concentrations were lower than 10,000 mg kg-1 in
all 1978 treatments by 1 July (Figure 3 ). The soil NO3-N concentrations
