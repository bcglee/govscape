380 AMERICAN POTATO JOURNAL (Vol. 65
in 1978. Labeled urea (77.6 atom percent 15N) was added to the urea
fertilizer to give 3.215 atom percent excess 15N in the 11 August 1980 N
application. Additional N treatments in these experiments were discussed
previously ( 16 ).
Both experiments were sprinkler-irrigated with a 15- by 12-m sprinkler
head spacing when the plant-available soil moisture in the root zone dropped
between SO and 60%. Soil moisture was monitored with tensiometers placed
in the row at the seed-piece depth (0.2 m). Each irrigation brought the soil
moisture back to near the field capacity. Aldicarb (2-methyl-2[methythio]
propionaldehyde 0-[methylcarbarnoyl] oxirne) insecticide and metribuzin
(4-amino-6-1[1,1-dimethylethyl]-methylthio-1, 2, 4-triazine-5[4H]) herbicide
were used in both experiments at 3.3 kg ha-1 (a.i.) and 0.8 kg ha-1 (a.i.),
respectively.
Whole plant samples (a 1.5-m row segment) were taken from each plot
at selected intervals from mid-tuberization to vine-kill. Plants were separated
into stems, roots, tubers, active and inactive leaves. Active leaves are defined
as those showing no visible signs of senescence. Roots and tubers were
washed. All plant tissues were dried at 60 C, weighed for dry matter
determination, ground to pass a 40-mesh screen, and analyzed for total N,
including NO3-N (2). The plant N was also analyzed for atom percent 15N
with an AEI MS-20 isotope-ratio mass spectrometer using conversion techniques
(11). The percentage of N fertilizer recovered in each plant part from the
15N-depleted (NH4)2SO4 was calculated from the equation, (100[NT] [a-
b]/Nf[a-c]), where NT is the N content of the fertilized plant parts, Nf is the
amount of 15N-depleted fertilizer added, a and b are the atom percent 15N of
the plant parts grown on the nonfertilized and fertilized soil, and c is the
atom percent 15N of the 15N-depleted fertilizer, respectively. The fertilizer
15N recovered in the plant parts from the enriched treatments was calculated
from the equation, (NT[a-b]/[c-b]), where NT is the N content of the
plant part, a and b are the atom percent 15N of the treated and non-treated
plant parts, and c is the atom percent 15N of the added N material (4). A
composite sample of 30 to 40 petioles from the fourth leaf down from the
growing tip was also taken from each plot at the same time as the whole plant
samples. They were dried, ground, and analyzed for NO3-N concentrations
(9).
All remaining plant tops were removed in late September in preparation
for final harvest. Tubers were mechanically harvested from two non-border
rows each 9 or 12 m long from the center of each plot during the first week
of October. Total tuber yields, the yields of graded tubers (1), and the speci-
fic gravity of about 4 kg of USDA #1 tubers were determined immediately
after harvest.
Statistical analysis of variance was carried out using a randomized
complete block design with the appropriate replications for each data set.
Duncan's Multiple Range Test was used to make comparisons among
treatment means.
