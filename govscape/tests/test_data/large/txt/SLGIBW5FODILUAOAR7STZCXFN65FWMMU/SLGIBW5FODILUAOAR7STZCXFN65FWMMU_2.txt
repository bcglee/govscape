1988) WESTERMAN, et al: NITROGEN FERTILIZER 379
Methods and Materials
All data were obtained from two experimental field studies near Kimberly,
Idaho, in 1978 and 1980. Russet Burbank potato seed pieces (0.06 kg) were
planted 0.2 m deep and 0.23 m apart in 0.91 m rows between 20 and 25
April on a Portneuf silt loam soil (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Durixerollic
Calciorthids). This soil has a calcic layer beginning at about 0.4 m that
restricts root penetration but not water movement. The experiments followed
cereal grains in the rotation to ensure a relatively low residual soil N content.
Individual plots were six rows wide by 15 m long. A randomized complete
block design was used with three or four replications.
A soil sample of several combined cores (0 to 0.46-m) was taken from
each replication for NO3-N analysis before any preplant fertilization (9),
and an incubation estimate (3) of N mineralized from soil organic N sources_
(Table 1). Soil NO3-N concentrations in the surface 0.46-m soil layer in each
treatment were also measured at each whole plant sampling in 0.02-m
diameter soil cores combined across replications.
All preplant fertilizers were broadcast and incorporated 0.15-m into
the soil. Preplant P, K, and micronutrient applications were based on
University of Idaho soil test recommendations (10). Preplant N for 1978 and
1980 was applied as 15N-depleted (NH4)2SO4 (0.0199 atom percent 15N),
and NH4NO3, respectively; seasonal N applications were broadcast on the
surface as urea immediately before an irrigation (Table 1). In 1978, K 15NO3
(83.89 atom percent 15N) was added to the urea, giving 4.233 and 3.788
atom percent excess 15N for the 21 June and 2 August N applications,
respectively. Two different replications were used for each labeled N application
