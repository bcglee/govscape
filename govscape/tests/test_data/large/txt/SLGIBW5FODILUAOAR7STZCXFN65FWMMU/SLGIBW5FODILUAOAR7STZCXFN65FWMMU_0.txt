NITROGEN FERTILIZER EFFICIENCIES ON POTATOES'
Dale T. Westermann, Gale E. Kleinkopf, and Lynn K. Porter2
Abstract
Nitrogen fertilizer efficiencies must be known to successfully apply N
fertilizer according to crop growth needs. The objective of this study was to
determine the recovery, partitioning, and translocation of N fertilizer applied
at different times for potato production. Russet Burbank potatoes were
fertilized preplant with 15N-depleted ammonium sulfate, and during early
and late tuber growth with urea containing KI5NO3 in 1978 or (15NH2)2C0
in 1980. All N applications increased tuber yields above the control treatments.
The N recovery efficiency was 60% for the preplant N application, and over -
80% and near 60% for the N applications during tuber growth in 1978 and
1980, respectively. Good agreement was found between the isotope and
difference methods of determining N recovery efficiencies. Labeled N was
initially concentrated in the stems and leaves, particularly if applied during
tuber growth. Over 80% of the assimilated, labeled nitrogen was found in
the tubers at the start of plant maturation. These data indicate that a
significant improvement in N fertilizer efficiency would result from split N
fertilizer applications made according to crop growth needs.

Para una aplicaciOn exitosa del fertilizante nitrogenado se debe conocer
la eficacia del mismo, de acuerdo con las necesidades de crecimiento del
cultivo. El objectivo de este estudio fue determiner la recuperaciOn, division,
y transporte del fertilizante nitrogenado aplicado en diferentes periodos en
la producciOn de papas. Se fertilizaron papas del cultivar Russet Burbank
con sulfato de amonio carente de 15N, antes de la siembra, y con Urea
conteniendo K15NO3 durante el crecimiento inicial y final de los tuberculos
en 1978 o con (15N1-12)2C0 en 1980. Todas las aplicaciones de N incrementaron
