were also less than 5 mg kg"! after 1 August. These concentrations indicate
that the plant's N uptake rate would not be sufficient to prevent a net loss of
N and dry matter from the tops and roots to the tubers (16). Nitrogen
applied under these conditions would probably be rapidly taken up and
utilized by the plant (Figure 2B and 2C). This situation may enhance N
recoveries, since the applied N would not be available for loss by other
mechanisms, e.g., leaching, denitrification.
The soil NO3-N concentration in the 1980-2 treatment was above 10
and 6 mg kg-1 on 1 August and 19 September, respectively (data not shown).
This, combined with greater than 17,000 mg kg-1 petiole NO3-N concentrations
(Figure 3), indicates that N was probably not limiting growth in this
treatment. Soluble P concentrations in this treatment's petioles were less
than 1,000 mg kg-1 by 23 July (data not shown). Below this concentration,
the P uptake rate is not sufficient for tuber growth and P is lost from the tops
and roots by translocation to the tubers (15). An active top, ie., leaves, is
necessary for nitrate assimilation since most of the nitrate reductase is in the
leaves (13). This apparent P deficiency would cause a premature plant
senescence and thereby reduced the 15N recovered from the 11 August 1980
N application. This is supported by the leveling off of total N uptake after 15
August 1980 (Figure 1).
