Sampling Date
FIG. 2. The percentage of 15N recovered in the different parts for the 1978 N fertilizer treat-
ments; A. 134 kg N ha-1 applied preplant; B. 45 kg N ha-1 applied 21 June; C. 45 kg N ha-1
applied 2 August (dashed line is the total recovery for the 11 August 1980 15N treatment).
Vertical bars represent the standard deviation for total plant recovery for that N treatment and
sampling date.
Soil NO3-N concentrations were also less than 5.0 mg kg- 1 by 1 August in all
N treatments except for 10 mg kg-1 in the1980-2 treatment (data not
shown).
Discussion
Nitrogen applied seasonally in 1978 had a higher plant recovery percentage
than preplant applied N. The seasonal N (urea) in 1978 was enriched by
K15NO3 which may have exaggerated the N fertilizer recoveries. The
apparent N fertilizer recovery was calculated by (Ni-Nc)100/Nf, where N1
and N1 is the N uptake by the plants and N fertilizer applied for the N
treatment, and Nc is the N uptake by the plants on the control treatment,
respectively. These calculations showed that the apparent recovery of N
fertilizer for the 1978-2 preplant N treatment approached 60%, while the
apparent recovery for the 1978-3 seasonal N treatment increased from about
40% to greater than 80% for the last two samplings. The apparent recovery
for the 1980-2 seasonal N treatment was about 50%. In general, these data
closely agreed with the 15N data. Similar agreement between 15N data and
apparent N fertilizer recoveries are reported for N banded at planting (14).
