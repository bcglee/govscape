1988) WESTERMAN, et al: NITROGEN FERTILIZER 381
Results
The total tuber yields were increased by N fertilization in both experiments
(Table 2). No apparent yield differences occurred between the preplant N
and the seasonal N treatments in 1978 (2 vs. 3), but there was a significant
specific gravity reduction in the seasonal N treatment. Seasonal N applications,
in addition to preplant N, did significantly increase total tuber yields in
1980 (1 vs. 2).

Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased whole plant N uptake
over the control treament in 1978 (Figure 1). The N uptake for the preplant
N treatment was also significantly larger than that for the seasonal N
treatment at early samplings (30 June and 10 July). This was reversed at
later samplings (21 August and 5 September). Nitrogen uptake for treatment
2 was significantly larger than treatment 1 for all samplings in 1980. The N
uptake was generally larger in 1980 than 1978, reflecting the higher N
fertilization rates and mineralized N (Table 1). The N uptake in the plants
did not change appreciably after 1 August for the control and preplant
treatments, but continued to increase in the 1978 seasonal N treatment
(Figure 1).
The percentage of N fertilizer recovered by the plants in the preplant
N treatment increased from about 30% at the first sampling (19 June) to
slightly more than 60% for the last three samplings (Figure 2A). The
percentage recovery of the 15N applied 21 June rapidly increased to about
85% by 10 July (Figure 2B), while the recovery of 15N applied 2 August
approached 80% by the last sampling (Figure 2C). Recoveries of the 15N
applied on 11 August 1980 were about 60% by the last sampling (Figure 2C).
The distribution of the 11 August 1980 15N in the plant parts was similar to
the 2 August 1978 application, but proportionally lower (data not shown).
