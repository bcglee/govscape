We believe, based on our discussions with military
experts and the analysis of over 40,000 morning re-
ports, that the location refers to the point of mail
distribution which was the base camp of the company's
brigade or division* If this information is pres-
ently available, it Is more easily retrieved from
USARV station lists."
ESG Comment; Morning Reports are the document
which would record the actual day a unit moved it's base
camp. USARV Station Lists would not provide this
information. Also the USARV Station Lists are not
updated to reflect a unit's move until many months
later. Morning Reports are definitely the best
source document to use when verifying a unit's major
base camp.
b.l. AOP Statement (paragraph 2, page 28)"....morning re-
ports refer to either the brigade or division base
camps, without further documents, we cannot determine
which."
ESG Comment: ESG could easily furnish additional
documents to verify the morning reports. This method
is done all the time in connection with the many
other ongoing studies where detailed tracking is re-
quired. AOP acts as though one could use Morning
Reports exclusively. Such is not the case. ESG has
maintained that the MR's must be used in conjunction
with other reports and daily journals, then they make
sense. This paragraph points out the naivete of the
AOP approach.
c.l. AOP Statement (paragraph 1, page 32). "One major
problem with obtaining locations from morning reports
Is that we have been unable to locate these reports
for 40 percent of the days being studied. When the
reports are available, only an APO number occurs 48
percent of the time."
ESG Comment; There are morning reports for
every month which would verify the major base camp location
for each and every day. An experienced researcher
can interpret the APO number and locate the unit's
main base camp location. There are many reasons why
morning reports are missing. No change in status is
one example. Our trained researchers have the abil-
ity to track the unit using other data source materials.
