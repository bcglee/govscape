Identify units which are more than 25 kilometers from any herbicide applica-
tion during one-month time periods, and to consider then as unexposed during
that month. Computerlied data already on file at CDC should be accuratt
enough to nake this an efficient and feasible screening process and the anti-
cipated clustering of herb1e1d« applications should yield a substantial number
of battalion-months that trill not require a hand search for loeatlonal Infor-
mation. As an example, the battalion containing the company which was
selected at random to prepare for the mtlng was never within 25 kilometers
of a herbicide application during the month selected, ind It would have been
unnecessary to more accurately, locate any of the companies of that battalion
during that period. All participants 1n the meeting agreed that the proce-
dures suggested and discussed would benefit the tloely progression and use-
fulness of the Agent Orange Ep1dem1olog1cal study.
