These errors were critical Because they reaucea the number of
points and unique days obtained from tne abstraction. rtnotner type of
error was inclusion errors. These errors were defined as the numoer of
locations or days which were not in tne source document but included by
ESG abstractions
To evaluate the omission ana inclusion errors, the ESGi and CDC
abstractions were combined and edited to produce a compromised, optimal
abstraction. This optimal abstraction was named the ESG and CDC
abstraction and used as a "gold standard" to evaluate the ESG
abstraction. Two summary taoles— Taole 2 and 3 —were created for these
purposes.
