lacious nature of the original AOP imposed location
criteria.
r. AOP Statement (paragraph 5, page 20). "Based
on the reabstraction of military records for four different
months involving three different battalions mentioned
above, we suspected that we were not receiving all
possible information on a company's location on all
days during 1967 and 1968. While we had concerns
about the quality of location data being received
from ESG prior to this meeting, the data presented at
the meeting indicated that they may be of such poor
quality that they may compromise the scientific cred-
ibility of the study. We also believe, based on our
own research and the reabstraction of data presented
by ESG, that it is possible to obtain a data set of
reasonably high quality If the abstraction process is
changed to collect more of the available information
from the military records. Moreover, we believe that
unit location information of sufficient completeness,
accuracy, and reproducibillty to withstand the
scientific scrutiny which will occur at the comple-
tion of the study is more likely to be obtained If
the abstraction process is directed by AOP scien-
tists, rather than ESG."
ESC Comment; We agree that because of the AOF
imposed criteria, t"h"at the data on daily company loca-
tions may be faulty. Why doesn't AOP admit this was
of their doing and that if ESG is permitted to freely
abstract and interpret daily locations the problem
will be readily solved with an appreciable improve-
ment in accuracy. AOP gives no information whatso-
ever as to how they ensured quality control of daily
location data imputs to the AOP computers. In no way
will ESG agree to any transfer of the abstraction
process to AOP scientists who have little or no
background experience with Army operational records.

s. AOP Statement (paragraph 2, page 21). "AOP
generally would not describe a meeting in a scientific
report, but we believe this information necessary to justify
our recommendation that AOP needs more direct control
over the abstraction process. In this way AOP can be
responsible for the validity of the exposure indices
and can enlist the services of additional experts in
the areas of military operations and records. These
