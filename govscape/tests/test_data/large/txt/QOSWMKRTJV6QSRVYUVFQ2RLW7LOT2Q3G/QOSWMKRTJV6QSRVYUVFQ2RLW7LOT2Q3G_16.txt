Battalion Tracking Procedures
Dan McGee, Senior Statistician, Agent Orange Projects
This memorandum reports the results of a review of the battalion abstraction
process for the Agent Orange Study by Canters for Disease Control (CDC). A
previous report by me gives details of the battalion abstraction process,
including a review of army documents and terminology, a description of each
data field on the battalion abstraction form, and a section on how to
interpret text in the army documents. This report was sent to Mr. Don
Hakenson of The U.S. Army and Joint Services Environmental Support Group (ESG)
on February 6, 1985 for review.
The primary purpose of our review is to see if a group of researchers
independent of the ESG can extract the same information on a battalion's
locations using the same army documents. Specifically, can two independent
groups arrive at the same overall battalion location for each day from their
respective abstractions? The secondary purpose of the review is to numerate
disagreements in abstractions. Characterizing disagreements will help
describe the data and perhaps be useful in editing the battalion data sets for
analysis.
CDC selected randomly four time periods to examine: May and June, 1967 of
Battalion 4; April, 1967 of Battalion 12; and June, 1967 of Battalion 21.
Drew Baughman and Christie Ernst researched the records for these battalions
without knowledge of the data the ESG had abstracted. Appendix A contains all
documents researched for this report. We used the procedures outlined in the
report mentioned above; from all accounts, these procedures appear to be those
that the ESG uses for their abstraction.
The first part of this report estimates the similarity and looks at
differences between ESG and CDC abstractions. The second part compares the
ESG set of locations before and after editing disagreements against the set of
procedures for abstraction documented by CDC.
I. ESG-CDC Comparison
The left side of Tabla 1 shows the distance in kilometers between the ESG and
CDC overall battalion locations and the number of abstracted locations by
battalion, date, and research group. For reasons not discussed here, cluster
analysis is used to compute an overall battalion location for each day, for
the ESG and CDC data sets separately. Appendix B outlines the algorithm to
compute an overall battalion location or centroid.
