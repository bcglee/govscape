their own proposals and omit any reference to counter
proposals from ESG particularly if AOP does not care
for the idea or suggestion. Another point is that
this peer review idea from AOP was never presented to
the WHAOWG Science Panel for consideration. Rather
it was an arbitrary unilateral decision by AOP that
such a review was called for. AOP should clearly be
made to understand that ESG is in no manner a sub-
contractor to AOP. We are very willing to serve
in the role of an equal research partner.
o. AOP Statement (paragraph 1, page 20). "We asked
Mr. Tavia Gordon, a consultant with AOP, to establish the
review group."
ESG Comment; Mr. Gordon is not known to us. We
have never met nor communicated with him.
p. AOP Statement (paragraph 2, page 20). "Mr. Gordon
did contact Mr. Stanton, and after further problems were
discussed with the location data supplied by ESG, AOP
employed Mr. Stanton as an AOP staff member."
ESG Comment; ESG is well aware of Mr. Stanton's
background as a historian. If Mr. Stanton should
discover any potential problems with the data we
would be happy to meet with him.
q. AOP Statement (paragraph 4, page 20). "A meeting
took place between ESG and AOP on November 12, 1985. We
discussed the information available for battalion #14
for April 1967. ESG had reabstracted the information
on the unit for presentation at this meeting. In
this reabstraction, locations were found where none
had been supplied to AOP by ESG from their original
abstraction. In the data originally sent, AOP had
location information for only 4 of 30 days, while
after reabstraction, information was obtained for 27
of 30 days. It also appears that there were numerous
abstraction errors in the data AOP originally re-
ceived, some of which resulted in placing units al-
most 100 kilometers from where they actually were."
ESG Comment; AOP had established the criteria
which resulted in location data for only 4 days
out of 30 for battalion #14. When ESG was freed of the AOP
imposed criteria then ESG was able to account for 27 of the
30 days with company locations. This merely proved the fal-
