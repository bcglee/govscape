*CDC did not check the first'ten days in May and June. A "-" means no
reference to Nickel in the document.
All references to Nickel for May and June of Battalion 4 were recorded as
XT571046 and coded as inferred from the day's Brigade Sitrep by the ESG, but
CDC found different coordinates for Nickel in the Brigade Sitreps, indicating
the location of Nickel changed.
The miscellaneous group of errors include taking coordinates for the wrong
battalion, an airstrike, artillery or small arms firing, five-digit
coordinates, and keypunch error.
Omissions were spotted in all three battalions reviewed. These were mostly
"patrol in position," "dustoff" or "dustoff complete" (medical evacuation of
men wounded in action), and "n/c" (no change) or "same position as last hour."
In addition to errors committed in abstracting coordinates, the ESG took the
TIME from the text and not the "TIME IN" column for all documents reviewed.
The ESG and CDC had good agreement for the first digit of the UNIT field, but
there were some differences in the second digit.
