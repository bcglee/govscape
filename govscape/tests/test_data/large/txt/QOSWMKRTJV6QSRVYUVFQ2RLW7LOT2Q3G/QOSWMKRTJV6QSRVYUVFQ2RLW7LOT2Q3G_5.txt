quality control mission. AOP had to go over their own
abstraction countless times. AOP's latest QC report in July
contained errors.
1. AOP Statement (A. Completeness and accuracy of
available location data, paragraph 1, page 14). " We now have
completed data for four months on three different battalions and
present the results in table 7."
ESG Comment: AOP has attempted to provide a rather
one sided view of the data. AOP has provided charts which
show AOP's initial reabstraction compared to ESG's data. AOP
does not state in the report that they reviewed their ab-
straction and found numerous errors in their original ab-
straction. AOP did not provide their edited or reabstracted
tables to the Science Panel. These edited and reabstracted
tables were originally reported in AOP's first Quality
Control Report dated 21 March 1985.
j. AOP Statement (A. Completeness and accuracy of
available location data, paragraph 1, page 14). " We compare the
difference between the average of the locations found in the
two independent abstractions of the data on the battalions,
the abstraction originally supplied by ESG and the re-
abstraction completed by AOP. If the number of points rep-
resenting unit locations and the general area in which they
occurred were similar for the two Independent abstractions,
we would expect this distance between the centroids to be
small. This, however, was not the case for many of the days
within the period studied."
ESG Comment; First of all, AOP has not provided the
correct data from their own Quality Control Report (Reference
statement above). There are many reasons why these two ab-
stractions disagree: (1) ESG or AOP abstracted the wrong points
(2) ESG or AOP abstracted N points or X points that the
other did not extract. (These points should not be consid-
ered for comparison when AOP is establishing a centroid.
Only the line companies (A-E) grid points should be
compared), (3) ESG inputed a grid for a village in which AOP
did not. It is apparent that for each day in which there is
a major difference in the locations, AOP and ESG should
analyze these data in order to identify the reason for the
discrepancy. This has not been done; however, we have
requested AOP's reabstracted grid coordinate points in order
to perform this analysis. ESG will not make assumptions or
initiate reports until we verify what the data reflects.
This can only be accomplished by checking the source
