these differences are due to either errbr In ESG's abstrac-
tion, error in AOP's or both. I scrutinized the docu-
ments, the sane for ESG and AOP, and found the latter to be
the case. Since the purpose of this report Is to review
ESG's abstraction of troop locations from Army documents,
the discussion that follows is limited to ESG's errors only.
Please note that "error" subsumes a variety of possible
mistakes and oversights and together they refer only to the
standard of abstraction outlined by AOP."
This report verlfys that AOP made errors in their QC
reabstraction process but still only stressed ESG's abstrac-
tion process. AOP used the term "possible errors" because
they cannot be completely sure they are errors.
The Epidemiologist, Scientist and Analyst have not had a
chance to analyze these points AOP extracted from the
records. It should be noted that AOP reabstracted or edited
their own abstractions countless times finding numerous
discrepancies from their original abstraction. There is no
yardstick. The rules changed and there is no way to
determine who is correct.
g. AOP Statement (A. Completeness and accuracy of
available location data, page 14). " The ability to reproduce
data is essential to establish the integrity and credibility
of a scientific study."
ESG Comment! It should be clear that there is nothing
comparable to laboratory data findings in the grid locations
and the recording of military data in journals and other
like records. They were never intended to be used for
epldemiologlcal studies. The definition of a grid coordi-
nate means a reference point on the ground. One has to ask
the question who has more expertise and credibility concern-
ing U.S. Army combat troop data, the U.S. Army or AOP?
h. AOP Statement (A. Completeness and accuracy of
location data, page 14)".... members of the AOP staff began
reabstracting data previously abstracted by ESG on selected
units. These AOP staff members were trained by the ESG
abstraction supervisor prior to beginning the process."
ESG Comment; The facts are that one member of AOP
Staff receivedtraining from the ESG supervisor for three days
It would be desirable if we could make an expert on the battal-
ion tracking process in three days but this is just not
possible. It is apparent the AOP abstractors encountered
numerous problems and difficulties when they performed their
