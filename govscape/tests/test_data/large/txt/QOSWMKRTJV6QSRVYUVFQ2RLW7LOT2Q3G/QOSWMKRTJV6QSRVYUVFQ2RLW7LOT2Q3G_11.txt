recommendations. There are many issues throughout this
report that are presented from one single point of
view in AOP's favor. This attempt by AOP to take
over this portion of the study negates the require-
ments for checks and balances to make a study cred-
itable and acceptable to the veterans who have
repeatedly expressed confidence in ESG. They deserve
the best that we can give them. Do not take that away
from them. Vietnam was an honorable war. We all did
our best. All AOP has to do is ask ESG directly for
what they want as has been the case in the past and
we will produce the Information. In summary:
Non-Concur by ESG. We do not believe that AOP has the
breadth of experience in military records abstraction so
that they can supervise any contractor (nor can a contractor
be found with expertise in personnel such as already
available in ESG).
u. AOP Statement (paragraph 3, page 22). "This
approach may have some merit, but we do not yet know how much
of the location data would have to be reabstracted.
If this approach necessitates a substantial amount of
reabstraction, it would be preferable to reabstract
all of the information as outlined in option 1. AOP
does not recommend this approach since everyone
agrees (ESG, AOP, and others Involved in recent dis-
cussions) that more location information exists in
the records than is being collected presently and
this new approach ignores those data. Furthermore,
since this approach requires that we reabstract only
a subset of the data, we are left with the Inaccura-
cies in the remainder. If AOP adopts this approach
we would increase the quality control on the data
being collected and have the reabstraction done
through a contractor supervised by AOP as with the
first alternative. The scope of work, however, would
be more limited than that described in option 1."
ESG Comment; AOP does not have an understanding of
the problem. After ESG has already qualified the study sub-
jects (163 data elements per individual) they are later
disqualified by AOP because of future new qualifications. The
job is manageable and can be accomplished with a few concessions
from AOP and AOP's admission that their location criteria
is faulty.
