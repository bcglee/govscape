MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR^SG
SUBJECT: CDC Quality Control Report, Dated 1 July 1985
1. On 16 July 1985, Bob Delaney, Drew Baughman and Riduan Joesoef from CDC
in Atlanta, Georgia, visited our organization to discuss battalion abstrac-
tion procedures and quality control.
2. During the visit Mr. Joesoef provided Mr. Hakenson of our staff a copy
of a quality control report he had sent to Mr. McGee concerning a quality
control abstraction comparison between CDC and ESG. lie reported that tae
CDC abstraction produced more points of locations than ESG had abstracted.
3. CDC based their analysis on a one week reabstraction on battalions #1,
2,5, and 7. Their recommendation was that battalion #2,5 and 7 be re-
abstracted. This was based on CDC'a reabstraction of the battalion data as
the "gold standard". I would like to point out that the procedures used by
CDC abstractors were obtained from a. memo dated March 21, 1985, written by
Mr. Drew Baugman, after spending 3 days at our organization attempting to
learn the abstraction process in January 1985.
4. Upon further reexamination and analysis of the CDC and ESG abstraction
process we were able to uncover CDC abstraction errors and key punch errors
by our staff. On battalion 12 there were two days in which CDC and ESG did
not agree. This was due to a key punch error in which two days of grid co-
ordinates were abstracted for the same day. Except for the key punch error,
all data was exact. In our opinion this did not warrant a total reabstrac-
tion.
5. On our examination of battalion #7 we found numerous grid coordinate
errors by the CDC abstractor. CDC showed they found 20 grid coordinate
points. Our examination reduced the number of points to 9. ESG's original
abstraction produced 15 good grid coordinate locations. Listed below are
:t,a types of recurring grid coordinate locations that CDC abstracted.
a. VC Sighting - When the tracked unit sighted VC and provided^ grid
location the CDC abstractor recorded this grid. This is the VC's
location not the tracked unit location.
