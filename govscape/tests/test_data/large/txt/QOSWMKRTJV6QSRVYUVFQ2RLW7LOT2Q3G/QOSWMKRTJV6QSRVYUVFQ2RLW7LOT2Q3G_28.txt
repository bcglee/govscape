II. ESG-ESG/CDC Comparison 13
To astiraata the affect, if any, of errors in abstraction on the daily overall
battalion location, I compute the distance between the daily centroids derived
from the ESG set of data before and after editing the errors listed in
Table 2. All edits to the ESG data set are based on the rules of abstraction
detailed by COC in a previous report. The right side of Table 1 tabulates
this distance by date for each battalion. The following summary of these
distances shows a difference of at least five kilometers 28 of 56 days for
Battalion 4, five of 25 days for Battalion 12, and two of 30 days for
Battalion 21.

Extrapolationg these figures to the rest of the battalion tracking data, I
recommend that Battalion 4 be re-abstracted using the current set of tracking
procedures, and one randomly selected week from each of Battalions 1-3, 5-7 be
reviewed. This statement is based on: (1) the poor reproducibility of the
daily overall battalion location due to errors in abstraction for about 50% of
the days CDC reviewed for Battalion 4; (2) the present Battalion Abstraction
Form was not implemented until Battalion 8, and therefore a different sort of
abstraction may have occurred before Battalion 8; and (3) the current set of
tracking procedures were not formalized for the early battalions.
