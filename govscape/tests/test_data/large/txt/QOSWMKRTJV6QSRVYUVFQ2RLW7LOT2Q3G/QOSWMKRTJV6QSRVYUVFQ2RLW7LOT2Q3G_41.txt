progress of Cohort Selection for Agent Orange 6p1dem1olog1ca1 Study

Acting Chair, Agent Orange Working Broup
At a meeting of the Science Panel held after the regular meeting of the ACW6
on November 6, 1988,' the progress of the cohort selection procass for the
Agent Orangt Epldemlologlcal Study being conducted by CDC was discussed.
Following the suggestion by congressional staff that meetings be held between
CDC Agent Orange Project! staff and the Environmental Support Group 1n the
presence of representstives from.the Science Panel, AOWT and OTA, and that the
Congressional staff be notified when such meetings ware to be held, the
Science Panel selected me, as a lubconnrlttee of one. ,to work with the other
participant*. I agreed to participate on those terms, and Ms. Helen 6elband
as an observer to the AOW and as the responsible person at OTA also agreed to
attend such meetings. U* scheduled a*meeting between the principals for
November 12 to be held 1* Washington at the offices of the ES9 and I requested
that both CDC and £56 select the same unit and time period and determine Its
dally location by grid coordinates 1n Vietnam using their respective methods
so that we could compare the two methods 1n concrete rather than theoretical
terms. It was hoped that we would be able to judge which method would be more
suitable for estimating posa1b1l1t1ei for exposure to Agent Orange among Army
combat troops 1n Vietnam, and thus enhance the quality of Inferences con-
cerning the health effects which might be due to such exposure If the results
of the^itudy so Indicated. In order to clarify the purpose of the meeting, 1
prepared an agenda, attached, which outlined two proposed methods for locating
company sized units on those days for which no precise grid coordinate for
the given company was available 1n battalion dally journals or higher level
reports* In addition to the principals listed on the agenda and their
colleagues, the meeting was attended by ttr. Victor Raymond, Majority Staff
Member for the Hospitals and Health Care Subcommittee of the House Veterans
Affairs Coraalttee.
At the beglnlng of the meeting, CDC Indicated that the procedure outlined 1n
method "b" of the agenda was clearly the more accurate but wu probably not
feasible to do for all units wMch would have to be tracked for the study.
The method 1s far too hand-Intensive, relies on Information which has not and
possibly can not be abstracted and coded from the source documents and
requires a level of sophistication for Interpreting records which 1s not
easily acquired on a Urge enough scale to avoid excessive delay 1n the
completion of the study. During the comparison of daily grid Ideations Iden-
tified by the two methods on a 3ayby-d*y basis, however, it became apparent
that there were significant gelnt 1ft the accuracy of estimating the dally
location of companies to be had by the contextual approach. The remainder of
