Dear Dr. Houk:
After analyzing and evaluating the AOP interim report
to OTA by our epidemiologist, a scientist and military ana-

the determination of possible exposure opportunity. The
material and data contained in this report, especially the
tables, are set up to demonstrate a single point of view

analysis of all sides of this complex issue. Further, where
errors are noted, it is requested that the report be
amended/corrected. The epidemiologist that reviewed the
report requests that we see the raw data in order to evalu-
ate the tables. Nowhere in the report was it mentioned that
the methods for capturing and recording of all the data were
dictated by AOP and we fully complied. The AOP liaison officer
spent two years with the data abstractors in the completion
of 18 battalions.
The following are specific comments relative to Interim
Report No. 2:

and Combat Selection, paragraph 1, page 2). " We have a list
of 65 combat battalions that served for at least 18 months
