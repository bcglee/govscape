order to qualify enbugh study subjects. This change will
disqualify the majority of the many study subjects that were
previously qualified by ESG and sent to AOP.
e. AOP Change; " Entire tour spent in units for which
location data is being collected."
ESG Comment; ESG is currently qualifying veterans
who served in a tracked unit but also transferred to units
that are not being tracked. Even if a veteran experienced
several herbicide exposures while assigned to a tracked
unit, he will be disqualified by AOP if he transferred to a
non-tracked unit. The reasoning AOP uses to disqualify
these veterans who were exposed has not been made clear. We
would like AOP to explain to the Science Panel, why study
subjects who may register multiple herbicide exposure hits
while assigned to tracked units and later assigned to
non-tracked units should be disqualified. This again eli-
minates high numbers of study subjects. A total of 1,871
study subjects were disqualified at AOP after qualification
at ESG from the first subgroup. The disqualification of
these veterans would require ESG to review additional re-
cords each month.
The disqualifying of such large numbers of veterans
could result in tracking of additional battalions in order
for AOP to qualify 17,000 veterans for the study. ESG is
currently reviewing over 6,000 records a month in order to
qualify 2,500 study subjects for use by AOP in which 70% of
the records are later disqualified at AOP. This is a major
increase in the quota every month. We completed the ab-
straction for the Vietnam Experience Study in which ESG
qualified 1,433 study subjects per month for AOP without
difficulty. This is a significant increase to ESG when
compared to the Vietnam Experience study. Every change
impacts heavily on extraction operations and cannot help but
affect time scheduling from ESG's standpoint.
f. AOP Statement (Section III - Quality and
Completeness of Location Information, paragraph 3, page 14).
"Limited reproducibllity conducted by AOP lead us to conclude
that the data are incomplete and inaccurate."
ESG Comment; The word "limited" might be a description
of the quality control functions AOP has performed to date.
The initial AOP quality control report dated 21 March 1985
states (see TAB A), "Assuming standard procedures for abstraction,
