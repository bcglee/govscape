Dear Rob:
The AOP staff express our appreciation to you and your staff for taking the
time to explain the methods and materials used in the Battalion search for the
Agent.Orange Study Pretest. The Agent Orange Project staff have reviewed your
questions concerning the battalion search and would like to provide necessary
guidelines to standardize the abstraction procedure for data collection in
subsequent Battalion searches. In order to adequately address these issues,
we would like ESG to provide us with some detailed information concerning the
locations and movements of infantry and artillery units selected for the Agent
Orange Study.
CDC would like ESG to initially track the companies/batteries, excluding the
headquarters company/battery, in each of the following four battalions:
1. 1st Battalion/2nd Inf. Regiment/lst Brigade/lst Inf. Division
2. 2nd Battalion/2nd Laf. Regiment/3rd Brigade/lst Inf. Division
3. 5th Battalion/2nd Artillery Regiment/II FForce.
4. 1st Battalion/5th Artillery Regiment/Ed.vArty/1st Inf. Division
(Note that on the original CDC list of 48 Battalions, these units were #1, #2,
#6, and 17.) These battalion searches will include tracking at the battalion,
company/batter^^platoon^ana squad uQit levels. 'ru""r"TT"n""
Currently, Paul Simpson, a computer programmer with the Project, and I are
working on a data entry and management system using the computer software
"Infostar" for your use in abstracting data in a standardized way from the
military operational and intelligent reports onto the KAYPRO II personal
computer. He and I plan to be in Washington on February 13 through 15 to
train the ESG researchers how to use the computer program. I have been
corresponding with Joan Wilson of your staff about the format of the data
entry form. A sample of the proposed data entry form is attached. Most of
the fields are self-explanatory. The "time" field refers only to the logging
in or out of coordinates specified in the Brigade and Battalion Daily
Journals. The form will be pretested here using some data sent down to us by
Joan. The remaining "bugs" in the system can be worked out during our stay in
Washington. Other details about transferring the data to CDC will also be
decided at that time.
