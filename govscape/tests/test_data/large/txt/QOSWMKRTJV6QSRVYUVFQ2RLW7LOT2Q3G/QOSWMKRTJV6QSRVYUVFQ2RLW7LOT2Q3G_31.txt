DAAG-ESG 10 September 1985
SUBJECT: CDC Quality Control Report, Dated 1 July 1985
b. When an artillery unit fired in an area, CDC recorded this location.
. This is not the units location but where that unit was firing.
c. One entry that was recorded was that the tracked artillery unit was
supporting another unit in a specific location. This was not the
tracked units location, but another unit that was requesting artillery
support (fire support).
6. Due to the discrepancies we found in the CDC abstraction process, we do
not feel the battalions warrant reabstraction. Our new researchers have made
the same sort of errors, but are taught through constant training to find and
identify these types of incidents and not to record them. The only con-
clusion I can draw from this report is that CDC is not proficient enough at
this stage of the battalion tracking process to produce reports criticizing
ESG. However, this did not stop CDC from producing and circulating a highly
critical quality control report. I would also like to point out that
Mr. Joesoef had never extracted grid coordinates from battalion records
before. 1 would strongly suggest that CDC follow the ESG SOP Abstraction
Procedures dated May 7, 1985 when abstracting grid coordinate locations.
