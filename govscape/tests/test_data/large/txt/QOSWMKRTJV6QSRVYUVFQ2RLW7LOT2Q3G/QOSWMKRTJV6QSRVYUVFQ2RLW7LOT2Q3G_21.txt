The ESG abstracted more locations for May of Battalion 4 (426 versus 337) and
for June of Battalion 4 (885 versus 421), and CDC extracted more locations for
April of Battalion 12 (331 versus 235) and for June of Battalion 21 (433
versus 326). CDC's abstraction places the battalion at least five kilometers
from ESG's 27 of 56 days for Battalion 4, nine of 25 days for Battalion 12,
and three of 30 days for Battalion 21. Assuming standard procedures for
abstraction, these differences are due to either error in ESG's abstraction,
error in CDC's, or both. I scrutinized the documents, the same for ESG and
CDC, and found the latter to be the case. Since the purpose of this report is
to review ESG's abstraction of troop locations from army documents, the
discussion that follows is limited to ESG's errors only. Please note that
"errors" subsumes a variety of possible mistakes and oversights and together
they refer*only to the standard of abstraction outlined by CDC.
Table 2 shows the errors in abstraction by the ESG for each battalion by
date. Five categories of errors are listed there: transcription errors,
projected or planned locations, coordinates imputed from a master list, a
miscellaneous group, and omissions. The following is a summary of these
disagreements. .

The transcription errors in Battalion 4 are mostly wrong translations for the
^rid. For example, an entry without a grid attached such as 556998 was taken
•s XT556998 instead of XS556998. A few transcription errors are wrong digits
such as taking 1 for 6, or transposition of digits such as 96 for 69.
