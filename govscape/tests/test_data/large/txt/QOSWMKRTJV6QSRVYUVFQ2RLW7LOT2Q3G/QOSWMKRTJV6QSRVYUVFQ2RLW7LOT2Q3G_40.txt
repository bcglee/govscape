As a measure of accuracy of data abstracted from the Daily Journals and other
military documents, CDC will conduct a replicate study of these four
battalions. Essentially, this will entail designating two CDC staffers with
the Agent Grange Project to replicate at least a portion of the abstraction
process conducted initially by an ESG team. The design and content of the
replicate study is being discussed and developed. This study will not
interrupt ESG's progress on the Battalion search. CDC will provide ESG with
details within the next few weeks.
The replicate study is not in lieu of the quality control program ESG will
perform for the Battalion search. We would like to have in writing a
description of your quality control procedures including (1) training of new
researchers, (2) review of data abstracted from the military records, and (3)
documentation of methods and materials. The CDC staff would, of course, like
to review and comment on the quality control program.
A double-blind quality control study using CDC staff would not be feasible.
Ebwever, the replicate study can be conducted Independently of the ESG
research team. The goal in this exercise would be to compute the concordance
or discordance of location information abstracted by the two groups. If such
a study were not conducted, accuracy of the abstraction method could be open
for criticism as not adequately evaluated.
For the initial searches on the four battalions, it would be best if a team of
two ESG researchers searches the entire two years of a given battalion. In
this way, inter-team variability within a battalion can be avoided, thus the
statistical evaluation of the replicate study will be more straight forward.
Thank you for your time and cooperation.
Sincerely yours ,
