Dear Mr. Christian,
This letter is in follow-up to our telephone conversation of 18
the abstraction of grid coordinates
from various military documents.
Beginning in the early planning stages of the Agent Orange Study,
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided very explicit in-
structions regarding the abstraction of grid coordinates from mil-
itary documents. In numerous planning meetings, Dr. Lee Aires t
stated which coordinates should/should not be taken. He stated
that coordinates' missing letters or digits (Mote: an exception
bein? a" four [4] digit coordinate) should not be taken as the
true location could not be verified. Moreover, this point of in-
terest was discussed numerous times with several other individu-
als from CDC and at no time was ESG given any instructions to the
contrary. CDC stressed time and again the importance of consist-
ency in data abstraction and not extrapolating on any incomplete
data. Unless the document clearly stated that the specific unit
of interest was at a particular location, coordinates were not
taken. For example, enemy locations -ware not taken unless U. S.
troops were also at that same location.
Finally, as we are both fully aware, the military documents are
not perfect and they were never intended to be used for any such
scientific endeavor. Never-the-less, despite their limitation,
I firmly believe that they do contain a large quantity of excel-
lent information.
Should you require any further clarification, don't hesitate to
contact me.
