"Many locations in Battalion 4 were simply lists of patrols, check points, and
command posts, only soma of which are later raportad for soma group's arrival
at these locations by stating "in position" or "closad." Most of tha
projection* errors are taking every location in tha list, not just the ones
later confirmed, and some are taking planned locations from a paragraph
explaining the next day's operations or from the plans summary at the end of
the journal.
Tha documents for Battalion 4 also contained many references to arrivals to
and departures from Fire Support Base Nicke,! (Nickel), Cu Chi base camp, and
Brno Trai village or airstrip. Of tha 529 such references, 312 are for Nickel
(all XT571046), 145 are for Cu Chi base camp (137 are XT6412 and 8 are
XT6415), and 52 are for Bao Trai village or airstrip (four unique locations).
Table 3 shows a check COG made to see if and when tha location for Nickel
changes.
