lected for the study. On 16 November 1983 we provided the master
list of 123 units which operated in the III Corps tactical
zone in 1967 & 1968.
b. AOP Statement ^Section II â€” Exposure Oppurtunity
and Cohort Selection , paragraph 4, subparagraph 2, page 2).M
The present selection criteria or a slight extension of
these will allow us to identify 17,000 U.S. Army vet-
erans . . . . "
ESG Comment - We sent AOP 7,500 qualified personnel
data abstraction forms (under AOP's new criteria) in which
only 1,500 study subjects finally qualified for the study.
The view here is that the criteria should change only when it
becomes apparent AOP will not receive enough study subjects.
This changing of criteria is not considered a slight change
when 70% of the already qualified study subjects become dis-
qualified .
c. AOP Statement (B. Selection of men from combat line
companies^paragraph 1 & 2, page 11). " Additionally, our
projections show that in order to obtain the required number
of men (17,000 qualified veterans), it would be necessary to
select men from almost all of the units on the list and the
selection criteria may have to be changed."
ESG Comment; ESG has presently qualified 12, 500
study subjects for the study. The new criteria would eliminate
approximately 8,500 of these study subjects. AOP has added
significant criteria changes to the study which eliminate
large numbers of veterans. Before we eliminate study sub-
jects we request Science Panel review, because of all the
work that has gone into this phase of this program.
d. AOP Change; M A veteran must only serve his tour in
1967 & 1968."
ESG Comment; Every veteran we have qualified that
had served one or more days in 1966 or 1969 is disqualified,
even if the veteran experienced several herbicide exposures
while in a tracked unit during 1967 or 1968. We would like
AOP to explain to the Science Panel, why study subjects who
may register herbicide exposure hits in 1967 or 68 should be
disqualified. This eliminates significant numbers of study
subjects. A total of 828 study subjects were disqualified
from the first subgroup at AOP after qualification and ab-
straction at ESG. This change of criteria would require ESG
to review an additional 60,000 records for the study in
