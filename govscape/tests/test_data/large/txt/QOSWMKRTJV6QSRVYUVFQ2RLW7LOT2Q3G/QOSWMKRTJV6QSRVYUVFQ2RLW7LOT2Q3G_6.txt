k. AOP Statement (paragraph 1, page 15). "We have
also discussed the reabstraction of other units, but ESG has
been unwilling to commit themselves to reabstracting ad-
ditional data."
ESG Comment; ESG policy has been stated at many
meetings over the last year that we will be happy to reabstract
any battalion when asked to do so. The aforementioned statement
is incorrect. ESG has only been asked to reabstract
battalion #4. We agreed to reabstract this battalion because
it was one of the early battalions tracked when using the
CDC KAYPROS (word processors). We later discarded the
KAYPROS because the researcher could not edit the data once
it was keypunched. AOP recommended that several units be
reabstracted but AOP failed to demonstrate ESG expertise in
the battalion tracking arena. ESG report dated 10 September
1985 (see TAB B) documents the problems ESG found with AOP' s
latest attempt at quality control. AOP wanted ESG to
reabstract 3 or 4 battalions as a result of their Quality
Control Report dated 1 July 1985. ESG demonstrated to AOP
that their report was less than acceptable and AOP dropped
the notion to reabstract the battalions. We are currently
working closely with Dr. Riduan Joesoef, AOP to develop a
quality control scheme in which the quality of data can be
accurately evaluated. Dr. Joesoef has worked well with
members of the staff to solve these problems and we
appreciate his Interest and efforts.
1. AOP Statement (paragraph 2, page 15). "The ap-
proach used by ESG to abstract military documents Is me-
chanical . "
ESG Comment; We agree with AOP that ESG de-
veloped the current method for abstracting company location
data. This was not the case for the early abstraction
phase when detailed instructions were given to ESG
(which turned out to be poor decisions confirmed at
the last Science Panel meeting). However, AOP has
continuously provided ESG with rules which has lim-
ited ESG on the decisions it could and should Infer.
There are numerous decisions or determinations ESG
could initiate if we were given a free hand to util-
ize our expertise of U.S. Army combat unit data. We
are convinced ESG's current methodology is the best
possible method for tracking combat battalions.
Clearly, the disagreements, technical as they may be,
