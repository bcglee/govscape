d.l. AOP Statement (paragraph 1, page 32). "Even when
coordinates are listed the coordinates often occur
again and again for the entire time period which
indicates that the coordinates refer to a fixed loca-
tion such as that of a division base camp and not the
actual location of the company."
ESG Comment; This is to be expected as major
base camps do not move. They were constructed and pro-
tected with chain link fences, barbed wire, bunkers
and open fields of fire. However, combat companies do
move in and out of these base camps.
e.l. AOP Statement (paragraph 3, page 32). "If the
locations obtained from morning reports represent these
locations, they should, on average, be reasonably
close to the field locations noted for the companies
in other documents. This analysis, however, indicated
that the locations obtained from the morning reports
are not truly representative of the physical location
of the company."
ESG Comment; This is an apparent misunderstanding
on the part of AOF. There is a significant difference
between a major base camp location and a field loca-
tion. Being in the field to an infantryman can mean
many things. Out on search-and-des troy missions, am-
bushes, fire support bases, the taking of an objec-
tive, retrograde movement and a host of other battle
situations such as serving as a screening force,
roads, bridges, protection and the like. Some of
these missions may take the company far afield from
the Division base location.
