point up the need for the separation of responsibili-
ties to make the study believable and that it be done
by military analyst who have worked on this project
for the last three years* In the Interest of getting
on with the project, the Science Panel might consider
assigning the total mission of selecting the study
subjects to ESG, thus allowing AOP to conduct the
interviews, physicals and statistical analysis. Dur-
ing the protocol development of this study ESG
planned to conduct the research and accomplish the
automation process, thus providing the principal
investigators blind lists of study subjects. AOP
wanted the automation portion of the recording of
data and so it was agreed. This concept of the pro-
vision of blind lists was also discussed and agreed
upon by the VA when it was thought that the VA would
be doing the study.
m. AOP Statement (paragraph 2, page 15) "AOP has
requested that ESG involve other mililtary experts In de-
cisions concerning the best methods for locating units, but
ESG considered this unnecessary."
ESG Comment; These techniques for abstraction were
dictated by AOP before they understood very much about the
battalion records. The AOP criteria as bad as it was, was
followed to the letter by ESG. The reason ESG has not called
in other so called "experts" to locate military units is
that ESG already has cornered the market in these
specialists with Vietnam combat experience and records
management expertise.
n. AOP Statement (paragraph 3, page 15). " All
parties then agreed to the establishment of a group consist-
ing of persons outside the Army."
ESG Comment; ESG rejected such a proposal be-
cause the best current expertise in records extractions is
in ESG. These persons suggested by AOP as reviewers
were less competent than the personnel now doing the
extraction process. We never agreed to a final peer
review selection process hence the last sentence is
not true. Not stated in this paragraph is ESG's
suggestion to let the 4 major Veterans organizations
each provide 2 former combat company or battalion
commanders to come in and review the record extrac-
tion process. This was summarily rejected by AOP but
it is never mentioned. AOP tends to write down only
