"While we believe that there Is sufficient
justification for continuing the study and
that the location of companies in Vietnam
can be determined, we also believe that the
study must be based on the most complete
and accurate information available. AOP cannot
suggest that the study be conducted with
less than good quality unit location data
since these data are critical to accurate
exposure assessment and since so much money
and effort are going into assuring that all
other aspects of the study result in valid
data. "
ESG Comment; We concur - let us get on with a
more accurate daily location process as conceived by
ESG and accomplished by the highly trained and compe-
tent ESG staff. Let ESG select the study cohorts
(names of individuals) without AOP interference and
unreasonable contraints which have been proven wrong
by AOP themselves, as exemplified by their report.
w. AOP Statement (Section IV - Conclusions, page
23). "Our major concern is the completeness, accuracy, and
reproduclbility of the unit location Information
supplied to us by ESG. Therefore, AOP would like to
discuss the assumption of direct responsibility for
the collection of unit location Information."
ESG Comment; Non-Concur by ESG as to any AOP as-
sumption of direct responsibility for abstraction of unit
location information.

Unit Location Information).
"We discussed the accuracy and completeness of
the data supplied by ESG in Section III. In
this appendix we describe documents and
methods presently employed by ESG and AOP
to obtain company-level location information.
The methods used to abstract the data do
not provide a location for every company on
each day of the period of the study. Con-
sequently, gaps exist in our knowledge of
company locations for approximately 50
percent of the days. In part A of this
appendix we describe data available from
