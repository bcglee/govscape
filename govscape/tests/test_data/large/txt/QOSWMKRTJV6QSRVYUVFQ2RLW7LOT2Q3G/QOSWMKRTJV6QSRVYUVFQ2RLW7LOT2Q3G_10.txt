comments are not intended to minimize the contribu-
tion that ESG has made to the study through the ab-
straction of Information on individual study
participants from military personnel files, and we
trust that this contribution will continue throughout
the remainder of the study."
ESG Comment: A report of any kind should be
presented fairly and supportable. While we can under-
stand it is much more convenient not to be subject to
peer review, AOP does not wish a review from above com-
ments. We have gone the extra mile all along and because
we want to see the study through for the sake of our Nation's
Vietnam veterans we will continue to complete our mission.
t. AOP Statement B. AOP recommendations for ob-
taining valid location information, page 21 & 22, "Transfer
responsibility for the collection of the location
data to AOP. We believe it would benefit the Agent
Orange Study to transfer the responsibility for the
collection of data on unit locations to AOP. It is
our judgment based on past experience and statistical
analysis that with current resources ESG cannot, on a
timely basis, abstract information with sufficient
accuracy and completeness to withstand scientific
scrutiny the completion of the study. AOP would hire
a contractor to abstract all the unit location data
needed for the study according to uniform procedures
specified by AOP. Performance standards would be
written into the contract and payment would depend on
the quality of service. AOP does not foresee the
need to request an additional Congressional appro-
priation for this work. We understand that the re-
cords being used for unit locations are controlled by
the National Archives and are available to the
public. Therefore, we do not foresee any
difficulties with continuing to gain access to
military Information. However, we would ask DOD to
help expedite the process. We also would renew our
request to DOD for short term consultative services
from members of the Military History Institute and
the War College. AOF would develop a data collection
procedure on knowledge already possessed and
information on the design from the experts on the
available military documents and the conduct of the
Vietnam War."
ESG Comment; We totally disagree with AOP's
