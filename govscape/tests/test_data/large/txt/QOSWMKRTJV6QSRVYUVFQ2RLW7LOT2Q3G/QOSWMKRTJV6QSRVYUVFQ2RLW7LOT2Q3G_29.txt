I used PROG FASTCLUS in SAS to cluster points for each day, for each data set
separately. This procedure uses an agglomerative, nearest neighbor method of
clustering. It uses the first nonmissing observation (point) as the initial
cluster seed, defines it as the first cluster, and proceeds sequentially
through the data set, computing.the Euclidean distance from the present
observation to. each of the cluster seeds. An observation is considered a new
seed if its minimum distance to previous seeds is greater than 3 km (chosen by
user).
Each observation is assigned to the cluster with the nearest seed, and after
an observation is processed, that cluster's seed is recalculated as the mean
of the observations currently assigned to the cluster. Cluster seeds are
iteratively recomputed up to five times (chosen by user).
I allowed for a maximum of five clusters on any day and computed the centroid
of all cluster centroids by day for the ESG and CDC sets of data, separately.
