the same area. Approximately 30 percent of bees nesters. These bees nest in abandoned
in North America are exclusively solitary wood beetle tunnels in logs, stumps, and snags. Thus,
dead limbs, logs, and snags should be preserved
as pollinator nesting areas wherever possible. A
few bees can chew out the centers of woody plant
stems and twigs to make nests there.
The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation
has been working closely with NRCS to increase
the agencyâ€™s capacity to implement pollinator
conservation projects across the U. S. The society
will help state and regional technical support teams
to develop tools necessary for implementing
high-quality habitat. This collaboration is particu-
larly valuable in light of the pollinator provisions in
the 2008 Farm Bill. For more information about The
Xerces Society and pollinator habitat conservation,
