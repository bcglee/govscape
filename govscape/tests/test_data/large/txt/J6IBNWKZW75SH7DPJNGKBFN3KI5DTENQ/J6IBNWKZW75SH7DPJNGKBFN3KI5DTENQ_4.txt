· Large differences in pH readings (± 0.5 pH) could be
due to lack of calibration, dry electrode, or rundown Battery
batteries. compartment
· If the pH meter cannot be switched on or if the display Immersion
level
fades, unscrew the battery compartment and replace all
four batteries, paying attention to their polarity (Figure
4c).
pH meter calibration (pHep 31):
Figure 4c.
· Prepare buffer solutions. Only 2 buffers are needed, pH 7 and 4 or 10, depending on the pH
range of your soils (see Figure 5c).
· Switch the unit on by pressing the ON/OFF button.
· With the meter on, press and hold the ON/OFF button for about three seconds. The display will
start blinking "7.0o" to confirm that you have entered the calibration mode.
· Immerse the pH meter in the pH 7 buffer solution. Stir gently and wait approximately 20
seconds.
· If "Ec" appears on the display, the pH 7 solution is not fresh, or the electrode is not conditioned.
· The pHep 31 meter automatically confirms the pH 7 calibration after the meter is adjusted. The
display will blink "4.0o". After a few seconds, it will display "Ec" to prompt you to use a
second buffer solution.
· Rinse the electrode with water and immerse in pH 4 for acidic samples or pH 10 for alkaline
samples. Allow approximately 20 seconds for the meter to auto-confirm the reading. Once the
display stops blinking, the meter is calibrated and ready to use. ALWAYS USE FRESH BUFF-
ERS FOR CALIBRATION.
