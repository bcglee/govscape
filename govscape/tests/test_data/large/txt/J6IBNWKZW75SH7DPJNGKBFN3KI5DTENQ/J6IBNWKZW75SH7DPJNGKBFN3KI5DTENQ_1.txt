B. Soil Respiration (Alternative Method)
This alternative method uses a kit produced by Woods End1 known as the Solvita Soil Life Kit1.
Instead of the Draeger tube apparatus, this procedure uses "paddles" inserted into a plastic con-
tainer with the soil sample (See procedure on page 32). The use of this method eliminates the need
for the Draeger tube (carbon dioxide adsorption tube), needle, and syringe. With the Solvita kits,
results are given in 24 hours instead of 30 minutes with the Draeger method. The color change of
the paddles may also be easier to distinguish than reading the color change off the Draeger tubes.
The Solvita kit also requires the soil to be disturbed and will falsely stimulate microbial activity
similar to the action of tillage. However, when used to compare sites, both soils are disturbed and
the relative differences are noted. This procedure also reduces the effects of root respiration.
Picking out as many roots from the sample as possible will further eliminate their CO contribu-
2
tion. The Solvita kit may be preferred if immediate results are not necessary and the microbial
activity differences without the influence of plant roots are desired.
The Solvita kit comes with well written and user friendly instructions and interpretations. There is
also a trouble shooting guide to help the user. The kit consists of four parts: the sample jar to hold
the correct volume of soil for the test (Figure 1b); a foil-pack containing a special color gel paddle
(Figure 2b); instruction manual; and a color key for reading results (Figure 2b).
Solvita Soil Life kits can be obtained from Woods End Research, Mt. Vernon, ME;
