C. EC and pH Meter Maintenance and Calibration
EC meter maintenance:
· Do not immerse the EC meter above the immersion
level (Figure 1c). Under no circumstances should the
meter be immersed above the display level.
· When not in use, switch off the meter and replace the
protective cap.
Immersion
Level
· To improve performance, clean the stainless steel
electrodes periodically by rinsing them in alcohol for a
few minutes. Figure 1c.
· Replace all four batteries if the display becomes faint

or disappears or if the readings are unstable or constant.
Calibration
Trimmer
· To change batteries for DiST WP1 models, unscrew the
top with a coin and replace the batteries (Figure 2c).
EC meter calibration:
· Immerse the meter into the calibration solution (1.41
dS/m).
Figure 2c.
· Allow the reading to stabilize. Using a small screw-
driver, turn the Calibration Trimmer to match the
solution value, 1.41 dS/m (normally at 25 C).
pH meter maintenance:
Crystals
· Crystals may appear around the cap (Figure 3c). This
condition is normal. The crystals will dissolve when
rinsed with water.
· After use, rinse the electrode with water to
minimize contamination.
Figure 3c.
· Store the electrode with a few drops of storage solution (HI 70300L) or pH 7 solution in the
protective cap. DO NOT STORE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER.
· Always replace the protective cap after use.
