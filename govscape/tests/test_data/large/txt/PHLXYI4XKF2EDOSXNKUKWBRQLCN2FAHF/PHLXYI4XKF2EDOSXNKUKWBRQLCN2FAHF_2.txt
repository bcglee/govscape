Implications
Due to the current epidemiologic evidence, this
outbreak has the potential to affect live horse,
semen and embryo exports. The estimated
potential value of this export market is $415 million
for 2008.1
Other potential costs will likely be felt domestically,
such as those related to movement restrictions,
trace-backs and increased testing.
