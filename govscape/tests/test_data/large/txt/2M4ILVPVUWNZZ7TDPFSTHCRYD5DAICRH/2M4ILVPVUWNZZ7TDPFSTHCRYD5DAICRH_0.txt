Other: Common evening-primrose is commercially
cultivated in over 15 countries for its oil which
contains the essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and
gamma linolenic acid (Kemper 1999). When the
seedpods ripen, the tall stalks can be cut and used as
interesting additions to dried arrangements.
Wildlife: Hummingbirds visit the flowers to obtain
nectar and insects to eat. The seed capsules provide
food for many other birds during the winter months.
It is thought that the plants are pollinated by night-
visiting hawk moths, which feed on their nectar.
Japanese Beetles prefer the leaves of common
evening-primrose to those of other garden plants.
