Milk and Milk Products. The availability of all milk and milk products
increased 6 percent, from 564 pounds per person (milk equivalent) in 1970
to about 601 pounds per person in 2005. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines
recommend that Americans consume 3 cups of milk and milk products per
person per day as part of a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. Using the loss-
adjusted food availability data, the researchers estimated that Americans on
a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet consumed 1.8 cups of milk and milk products
per person per day in 2005, suggesting that Americans, on average, are
consuming too little.
Added Fats and Oils. The Dietary Guidelines recommend that Americans
keep total fat consumption between 20 and 35 percent of daily energy
intake. In 2005, total added fats and oils available for consumption reached
86 pounds per person compared with 53 pounds per person in 1970. This
2005 estimate translates into 71.6 grams of added fats and oils per person
per day after adjusting for plate waste and other losses. This estimate does
not include dietary fats that occur naturally in foods, such as in dairy prod-
ucts and meats. Added fats and oils account for about 32 percent of total
calories for a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. In short, the findings suggest that
Americans, on average, need to cut back on added fats and oils because,
while the 32-percent figure is within the Guidelinesâ€™ range, it includes only
added fats and oils and excludes fats and oils naturally present in some
foods.
Meat, Eggs, and Nuts. The total amount of meat, eggs, and nuts available
for consumption grew from 225 pounds per person in 1970 to about 242
pounds per person in 2005. The Dietary Guidelines recommend 5.5 oz-eq
from the meat and beans group per person per day as part of a 2,000-
calorie-per-day diet. According to the loss-adjusted food availability data,
Americans on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet consumed an estimated 6.5 oz-eq
of meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and nuts per person per day in 2005. This
suggests that Americans, on average, eat more than the recommended
amount from this food group.
Added Sugars and Sweeteners. In 2005, added sugars and sweeteners
available for consumption totaled 142 pounds per person, up 19 percent
since 1970. The Dietary Guidelines do not provide quantitative recommen-
dations for added sugars but rather advise Americans to choose and prepare
foods and beverages with little added sugars or caloric sweeteners. The
Guidelines do, however, suggest that Americans on a 2,000-calorie-per-day
diet, who divide their discretionary calorie allowance equally between solid
fats and added sugars, limit consumption of added sugars and sweeteners to
8 teaspoons per day. According to the loss-adjusted food availability data,
Americans consumed 30 teaspoons per person per day of added sugars and
sweeteners in 2005. This finding suggests that Americans, on average, need
to scale back on added sugars and sweeteners.
