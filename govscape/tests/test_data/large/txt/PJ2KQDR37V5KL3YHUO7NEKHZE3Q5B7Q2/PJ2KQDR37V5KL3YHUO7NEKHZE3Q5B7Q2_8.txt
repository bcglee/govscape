1Calorie levels are set across a wide range to accommodate the needs of different individuals. This table can be used to help assign individuals
to the food intake pattern at a particular calorie level. A 2,000-calorie-per-day level is used in this report to be consistent with the nutrition facts
labels found on packaged foods.
2The fruit group includes all fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruits and fruit juices. In general, 1 cup of fruit or 100 percent fruit juice, or 1/2 cup
of dried fruit can be considered as 1 cup from the fruit group.
3The vegetable group includes all fresh, frozen, canned, and dried vegetables and vegetable juices. In general, 1 cup of raw or cooked
vegetables or vegetable juice, or 2 cups of raw leafy greens can be considered as 1 cup from the vegetable group. According to the MyPyramid
Plan, 1 cup of whole, mashed, or cooked dry legumes or 1 cup of 1/2 inch cubes of tofu count as 1 cup from the vegetable group.
4The grains group includes all foods made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, and barley—such as bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals,
tortillas, and grits. In general, 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal flakes, or 1/2 cup of cooked rice, pasta, or cooked cereal can be
considered as 1 oz-eq from the grains group. At least half of all grains consumed should be whole grains.
5The meat and beans group includes, in general, 1 ounce of lean meat, poultry, or fish, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 1/4 cup cooked
dry beans, or 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds.
6The milk group includes all fluid milk products and foods made from milk that retain their calcium content, such as yogurt and cheese.
Foods made from milk that have little to no calcium, such as cream cheese, cream, and butter, are not part of the group. Most milk group
choices should be fat-free or low-fat. In general, 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1½ ounces of natural cheese, or 2 ounces of processed cheese
can be considered as 1 cup from the milk group.
7Oils include fats from many different plants and from fish that are liquid at room temperature, such as canola, corn, olive, soybean, and
sunflower oil. Some foods are naturally high in oils, like nuts, olives, some fish, and avocados. Foods that are mainly oil include mayonnaise,
certain salad dressings, and soft margarine.
8Discretionary calorie allowance is the remaining amount of calories in a food intake pattern after accounting for the calories needed for all food
groups using forms of foods that are fat-free or low-fat and with no added sugars.
