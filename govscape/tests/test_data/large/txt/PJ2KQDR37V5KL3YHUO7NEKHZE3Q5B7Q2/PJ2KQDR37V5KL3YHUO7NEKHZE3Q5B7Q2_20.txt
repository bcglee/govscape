In addition to recommendations for total fat intake, the Guidelines suggest
limiting saturated fats, found in animal fats, to less than 10 percent of total
dietary fat. The Guidelines recommend that most fats should be mono-
unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, nuts, and
vegetables. According to the nutrient availability data (unadjusted for waste
and spoilage), Americans consumed both added and dietary fats in excess of
the recommended level. In 2004, per capita total fat (both added and natu-
rally occurring) availability reached 179 grams per day. Of this amount,
saturated fats accounted for 31 percent, and unsaturated fats accounted for
69 percent. Therefore, not only do Americans need to decrease their total
intake of fat, they also need to substantially lower their intake of saturated
fat in order to adhere to the 2005 Guidelines.
