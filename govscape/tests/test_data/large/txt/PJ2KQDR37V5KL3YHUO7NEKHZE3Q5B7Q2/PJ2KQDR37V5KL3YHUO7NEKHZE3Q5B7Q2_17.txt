The Guidelines also recommend fat-free or low-fat milk or equivalent milk
products instead of dairy products high in saturated fat. Food availability
data measure reduced-fat and non-fat versions for some dairy products, such
as fluid milk, cottage cheese, dry milk, and condensed/evaporated milks,
which contributed about a third of the total dairy allowance per person per
day. The data do not, however, distinguish the fat content of other dairy
products, particularly how much of the increase in cheese consumption is
due to the increased use of reduced-fat, low-fat, and non-fat cheese.
According to the International Dairy Foods Association, reduced-fat, low-
fat, and non-fat cheeses’ share of supermarket sales of cheese increased
from 19 percent in 1999 to 25 percent in 2005, suggesting that 75 percent of
cheese consumption still comes from regular or full-fat cheese products.
While Americans are gradually increasing their intake of lower fat cheeses,
they need to cut back considerably on higher or full-fat versions of dairy
products in order to meet the dietary recommendations.

1Aggregate data, unadjusted for cooking losses, plate waste, and other losses.
2Adjusted for cooking losses, plate waste, and other losses. According to MyPyramid Plan, 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1½ ounces of hard cheese,
2 ounces of processed cheese, 2 cups of cottage cheese, or 1½ cups of ice cream can be considered as 1 cup from the milk group. Only the
milk portion of half and half and eggnog are included in the daily dairy allowance; the cream portion is included in added fats. 3Cream cheese is
counted in added fats. 4Excludes full-skim American, cottage, pot, and baker's cheese. 5Includes items not shown separately, such as mel-
lorine, which is a nondairy alternative to ice cream (1970-1990).
