Introduction
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, about two-thirds of
U.S. adults in 2003-04 were either overweight or obese, compared with 47
percent in 1976-1980. The U.S. obesity rate among adults has more than
doubled, from 15 percent in 1976-1980 to 32 percent in 2003-04. The extent
of obesity has focused attention on what Americans have been eating. The
main reason for this weight gain is the estimated increase in caloric intake
without a corresponding increase in physical activity. More than 50 percent
of U.S. adults are not physically active. Poor diets and sedentary lifestyles
have been associated with diet-related chronic diseases in adults that include
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain kinds of
cancer (HHS, 2005).
In an effort to promote a healthy, balanced diet with adequate physical
activity and to reduce the incidence of diet-related health conditions, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services publish jointly the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Since its
inception in 1980, the Guidelines has been published every 5 years to
provide targeted dietary recommendations for Americans over 2 years of
age. Although the core dietary messages have remained constant over time
(e.g., eat more vegetables), each edition differs slightly to reflect the latest
scientific and medical information on nutrition and health. For example, the
January 2005 Guidelines and a supporting guidance document, the
MyPyramid Food Guidance System, introduced specific recommendations
for whole-grain consumption. The 2005 edition also breaks down the new
daily recommendations into 12 calorie levels ranging from 1,000 to 3,200
calories per day, depending on age, gender, and level of physical activity
(table 1). The MyPyramid Food Guidance System replaced the 1992 Food
Guide Pyramid and is designed to help Americans consume the recom-
mended amounts of the different food groups.
Among the major recommendations in 2005:
Grains—emphasize that at least half of total grains consumed should be
whole grains,
Vegetables—emphasize dark green vegetables, orange vegetables, and

The food availability data aggregate
them into an added fats and oils group
and do not provide estimates of dietary
fat from food sources, such as meat
and dairy.
