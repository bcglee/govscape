Beef Still Dominates, but Chicken
Is Gaining Ground
The total amount of meat, eggs, and nuts available for consumption (unad-
justed for waste and spoilage) grew from 225 pounds per person in 1970 to
about 242 pounds per person in 2005 according to the food availability data
(table 7). This 8-percent increase, however, was not distributed equally
across the meat group. Poultry availability, for example, provided a signifi-
cant contribution to the increase. Between 1970 and 2005, per capita poultry
availability more than doubled, from 34 pounds per person to 74 pounds per
person. Part of the rise in poultry, particularly chicken, results from the
chicken industry’s catering to consumers’ and foodservice operators’
demand for value-added, brand-name, and convenience products (Buzby et
al., 2006). During the same period, availability of fish and shellfish and tree
nuts and peanuts grew 5 and 3 pounds per person, respectively.
In contrast, red meat availability (beef, veal, pork, and lamb) faced a major
decline. Since its peak of 133 pounds per person in 1976, red meat avail-
ability fell to 110 pounds per person in 2005. This decline in red meat avail-
ability was largely due to beef, which dropped 17 pounds, or 22 percent
between 1970 and 2005. Availability of eggs likewise decreased during the
same period. Over the past three decades, red meat’s share of total meat
dropped while the share of poultry continued to rise. However, red meat,
particularly beef, remains the main source of protein in Americans’
diet (fig. 6).
Ounce for ounce, poultry and fish products have less fat, saturated fat, and
cholesterol than beef, according to USDA’s Nutrient Database for Standard
Reference. Also, according to the nutrient availability data (unadjusted for
spoilage and other losses), the proportion of fat in the U.S. food supply
contributed by red meat, poultry, and fish declined from 32 percent in 1970
to 20 percent in 2004. Much of this decline can be attributed to red meat’s
share of fat in the food supply, which dropped from 27 percent to 13 percent
during the same period. Similarly, red meat’s proportion of saturated fat
declined from 35 to 23 percent.
