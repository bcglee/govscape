Americans Are Consuming
Less Milk but More Cheese
According to the food availability data, the availability of all milk and milk
products increased 6 percent between 1970 and 2005, from 564 pounds per
person (milk equivalent) to about 601 pounds (table 5). Cheese availability
contributed significantly to the increase. Part of this increase can be attrib-
uted to the growth of food consumed away from home and the introduction
of new, convenient cheese products, such as resealable bags of shredded
cheese (Buzby, 2005). Between 1970 and 2005, the availability of cheese
(other than cottage cheese) nearly tripled, from 11 pounds per person to 31
pounds per person. Yogurt availability grew about tenfold. Meanwhile, avail-
ability of beverage milk, frozen dairy products, dry milk, and
evaporated/condensed milk declined. Beverage milk availability decreased
33 percent between 1970 and 2005. Within the beverage milk category,
whole-milk availability dropped 73 percent while lower fat milk rose 143
percent (fig. 4). Similarly, availability of frozen dairy products decreased 6
percent, dry milk 45 percent, and evaporated/condensed milk 52 percent.
The 2005 Dietary Guidelines recommend that Americans on a 2,000-
calorie-per-day diet consume 3 cups of milk and milk products per day.
According to our loss-adjusted food availability data, Americans consumed
1.8 cups of milk and milk products per person per day in 2005.5
5In our analysis, only the milk portions
of half and half and eggnog are
included in the daily dairy amount.
