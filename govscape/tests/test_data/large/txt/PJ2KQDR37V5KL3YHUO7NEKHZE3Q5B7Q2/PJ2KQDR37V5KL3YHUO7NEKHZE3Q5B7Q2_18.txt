Added Fats and Oils Alone
Contributed 32 Percent of Total Calories
Added fats and oils are found in processed food products (e.g., french fries,
baked goods, and snacks) and are used for cooking. These fats and oils are
consumed in addition to fats that occur naturally in foods, such as in red
meat and dairy products. According to the food availability data, per capita
availability of added fats and oils (unadjusted for waste and spoilage)
reached about 86 pounds per person in 2005, up 33 pounds from 1970.
Of the 2005 total, nearly 86 percent consisted of vegetable oils and related
products, such as margarine, shortening, and cooking and salad oils. Animal
fats, such as butter, lard, and edible tallow, made up the remaining 14
percent (table 6).
