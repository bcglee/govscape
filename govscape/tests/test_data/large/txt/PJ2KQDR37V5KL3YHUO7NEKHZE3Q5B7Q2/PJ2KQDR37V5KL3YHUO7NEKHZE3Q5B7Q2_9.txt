This report updates the analysis of Putnam et al. (2002), which examined
overall food consumption patterns between 1970 and 2000. Using the 2000
edition of Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
Putnam et al. estimated whether Americans were meeting the Guidelines’
recommendations. In this report, we used the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans to estimate the dietary status of Americans. The main goals of
this study were to: (1) analyze the amount of food available for consump-
tion since 1970 for each food group, and (2) estimate whether Americans
are meeting the Guidelines’ recommendations for each food group.
Food consumption patterns change in response to changes in relative food
prices, increases in real (adjusted for inflation) disposable income, and food
assistance for the poor. Moreover, time series data on actual consumption by
Americans are lacking. Most consumer surveys of dietary intake cover 1 or
a few years of consumption and most are not nationally representative of the
U.S. population. We tracked the amount of food available for consumption
over time and the dietary status of Americans using the ERS Food Avail-
ability (Per Capita) Data System, a unique, popular, and often-cited data
system that provides proxies for actual consumption.3The data system 3See www.ers.usda.gov/Data/
contains three separate but related data series—the Food Availability data, FoodConsumption/ for detailed
documentation of the data system.
the Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data, and the Nutrient Availability
data—that each look at food consumption differently.
The first series, the core food availability data, is the only time series data
on the amount of food available for consumption in the United States and is
a continuous series extending back to 1909 for many commodities. The data
are calculated for each food or commodity (e.g., beef, low-fat milk, and
fresh broccoli) as the sum of annual production, beginning stocks, and
imports minus exports, ending stocks, and nonfood uses. Per capita esti-
mates are calculated by dividing the total annual food supply of a
commodity by the U.S. population that year. Food availability data do not
directly measure actual consumption but rather serve as useful indicators of
food consumption trends over time. Used in this manner, the data provide an
upper bound on the amount of food available for consumption.
The second series, the loss-adjusted food availability data, adjusts the food
availability data for spoilage and other losses and converts the per capita
data to MyPyramid equivalents or daily allowance for comparison with
Federal dietary recommendations. The percentage of food lost due to
spoilage and other losses at several different stages along the food produc-
tion, marketing, and consumption chain are identified for each commodity
or food. In addition, the estimates incorporate loss assumptions for non-
edible food parts, such as rinds, seeds, cores, and stems, as estimated in
USDA’s Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (www.nal.
usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search). Next, we converted the loss-adjusted data
from pounds per capita per year into daily per capita food intake in
MyPyramid equivalents or daily allowance (as identified in USDA’s
MyPyramid Food Guidance System, www.Mypyramid.gov). The estimated
MyPyramid equivalents for individual commodities or foods are then aggre-
gated to determine total daily amounts for each food group. We then
compared these estimates with Federal dietary recommendations to provide
