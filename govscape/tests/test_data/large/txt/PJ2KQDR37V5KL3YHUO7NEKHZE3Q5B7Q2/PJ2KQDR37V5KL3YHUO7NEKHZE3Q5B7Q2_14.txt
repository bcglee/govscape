Despite our estimate that Americans are consuming more fruits and vegeta-
bles than they did in 1970, they are still not meeting the Dietary Guidelines’
recommendations. According to the loss-adjusted food availability data,
Americans on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet consumed 0.9 cup of fresh and
processed fruits per person per day in 2005, less than half the Guidelines’
recommendation of 2 cups. We also estimated that each American ate 1.7
cups of fresh and processed vegetables per day in 2005, about 45 percent
below the recommended amount of 2.5 cups in the Dietary Guidelines.
