Americans Are Consuming
More Fruits and Vegetables
In general, Americans have been consuming more fruits and vegetables over
the last three decades, according to food availability data. In 2005, per
capita total fruit and vegetable availability (fresh and processed, fresh
weight equivalent, unadjusted for waste and spoilage) reached 687 pounds,
up 110 pounds, or 19 percent, since 1970. This 19-percent increase was not
distributed equally among the 134 fruits and vegetables covered in the ERS
data. Much of the rise within fruits was contributed by the noncitrus group,
particularly apples, bananas, and grapes (table 3). Among the vegetable
group, tomatoes, onions, and leafy lettuces contributed to the increase (table
4).
