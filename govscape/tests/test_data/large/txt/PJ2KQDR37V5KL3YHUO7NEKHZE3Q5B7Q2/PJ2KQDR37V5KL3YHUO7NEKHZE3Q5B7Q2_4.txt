Summary
The U.S. obesity rate among adults has more than doubled since 1970. The
extent of obesity in this country has focused attention on what Americans
have been eating. Americans are eating more from all of the major food
groups—even fruits and vegetables. However, many are not meeting the
Federal dietary recommendations. For Americans to meet these recommen-
dations, they would need to substantially lower their intake of added fats,
refined grains, and added sugars and sweeteners and increase their
consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lower fat milk and
milk products.
What Is the Issue?
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, about two-thirds of
U.S. adults in 2003-04 were either overweight or obese, compared with 47
percent in 1976-80. During the same period, the obesity rate among adult
Americans has more than doubled, from 15 percent to 32 percent. This
raises questions about what and how much Americans are consuming
each year.
What Did the Study Find?
ERS’s food availability data suggest that the food available for consumption
increased since 1970 for all major food groups. Although availability
continued to rise in the last three decades, many Americans still fall short of
Federal dietary recommendations for certain food groups. According to
ERS’s loss-adjusted food availability data, Americans are consuming too
many foods and beverages high in fats and carbohydrates and too few
nutrient-dense foods and beverages, such as lower fat milk and milk prod-
ucts, fruits, and vegetables.
Grains. Total grain availability (wheat flour, rice, corn products, oat prod-
ucts, and barley products) increased 41 percent, from 137 pounds per person
in 1970 to 192 pounds per person in 2005. For Americans on a 2,000-
calorie-per-day diet, the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend
consumption of 6 ounce-equivalents (oz-eq) of grains per day with whole
grains accounting for at least half of this amount. Using ERS’s loss-adjusted
food availability data, the researchers estimated that Americans on a 2,000-
calorie-per day diet consumed 8.1 oz-eq of grains per person per day in
2005 of which 7.2 oz-eq were refined grains and 0.9 oz-eq were whole
grains. This suggests that Americans, on average, over-consume refined
grains yet fall short on whole-grain intake.
Fruits and Vegetables. In 2005, the amount of fruits and vegetables avail-
able per person for consumption reached 687 pounds (fresh weight equiva-
lent), 19 percent above the 1970 level. The Dietary Guidelines recommend
that Americans eat 2 cups of fruits and 2.5 cups of vegetables per person
per day as part of a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. The loss-adjusted food
availability data suggest that Americans on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet
consumed 0.9 cup of fruits and 1.7 cups of vegetables per person per day
in 2005. Thus, Americans, on average, are eating less than the recommended
amounts.
