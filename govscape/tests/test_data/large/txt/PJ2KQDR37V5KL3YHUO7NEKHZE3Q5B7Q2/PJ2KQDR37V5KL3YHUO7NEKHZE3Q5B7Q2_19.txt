One important caveat about the added fats and oils data is that the number
of firms reporting vegetable oil production to the U.S. Census Bureau
increased noticeably in 2000. As a result, the availability of salad and
cooking oils and shortening rose from 50 pounds per person in 1999 to 65
pounds person in 2000, a 31-percent increase. We believe it unlikely that
this unusually large increase in the number of firms occurred in 1 year; it is
more likely that the number increased incrementally over time. The jump
could suggest that the availability estimates in a few years before 2000 were
somewhat underestimated. However, we do not have additional information
from the U.S. Census Bureau to clarify that supposition. Therefore, the data
must be interpreted with care when discussing particular estimates for salad
and cooking oils and shortening around 2000 or when discussing more
aggregated numbers that use these estimates, such as estimates for total
vegetable fats and oils or total added fats and oils seen in figure 5.
In general, the added fats and oils data show modest increases from 1970 to
1999, the big increase in 2000, moderate increases until 2002, and then a
decline between 2002 and 2005. Despite the data limitations around 2000,
the data make the important point that the availability of added fats and oil
has generally trended upward since 1970.
According to the Guidelines, fats are part of a healthful diet, although
excessive intake, particularly of saturated fats, is associated with high
cholesterol and coronary heart disease. The Guidelines recommend that fats
and oils, both added and naturally occurring, contribute 20 to 35 percent of
daily energy intake depending on calorie level.6 People on a 2,000-calorie- 6The Guidelinesrecommend that fats
