Notes: Totals may not add due to rounding. Oz-eq = ounce equivalent. --- = less than
0.05 oz-eq.
1Aggregate data, unadjusted for cooking losses, plate waste, and other losses, excluding quan-
tities used in alcoholic beverages and fuel, popcorn, and other whole-grain foods.
2Adjusted for cooking losses, plate waste, and other losses. According to MyPyramid Plan,
1 slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal flakes, or 1/2 cup of cooked rice, pasta, or cooked
cereal can be considered as 1 oz-eq from the grains group. At least half of all grains con-
sumed should be whole grains.
3Includes flour equivalent of imported pasta products.
4The estimate of 8.1 oz-eq is the 7.5 oz-eq from the loss-adjusted food availability data plus the
missing whole-grain foods of 0.6 oz-eq from Putnam et al. (2002).
