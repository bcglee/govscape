an estimate of whether Americans are meeting the dietary recommendations
for the different food groups.
In particular, we compared the amount of food consumed by the average
American with the amount recommended in USDA’s Food Guide in
Appendix A-2 of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These recom-
mendations are broken into 12 calorie levels ranging from 1,000 to 3,200
calories per day. Our data are unavailable on the distribution of Americans
among each of the 12 calorie levels in the Dietary Guidelines so instead, we
used the 2,000-calorie-per-day reference level in our analysis to be consis-
tent with the level used throughout the examples in the Dietary Guidelines
and on the nutrition facts labels found on most packaged foods. Like the
food availability data series, the loss-adjusted data do not directly measure
actual consumption. The data are useful in approximating the amount of
food Americans, on average, consume on a daily basis.
The third series, the nutrient availability data, calculated by USDA’s Center
for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (www.cnpp.usda.gov), uses the food
availability data to calculate the amounts per capita per day of food energy
(calories) and 27 nutrients and dietary components (i.e., protein, carbohy-
drates, fats, vitamins, and minerals) in the Nation’s food supply. As with the
food availability data, the resulting nutrient and calorie estimates do not
account for losses due to the household and marketing system. In our
analysis, we used the nutrient availability data to estimate the percentage of
calories contributed by fat and saturated fat in the average American’s diet.
The analyses had several key findings. We found that many Americans do
not meet the Federal daily dietary recommendations.They consume foods
and beverages high in fats and carbohydrates at greater than recommended
rates and nutrient-dense foods and beverages, such as lower fat milk and
milk products, fruits, and vegetables at levels below recommended rates
(fig. 1).
