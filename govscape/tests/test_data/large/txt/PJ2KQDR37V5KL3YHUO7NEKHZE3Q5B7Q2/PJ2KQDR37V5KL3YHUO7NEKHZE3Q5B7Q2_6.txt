How Was the Study Conducted?
The analysis used the three data series that comprise ERS’s Food Avail-
ability (Per Capita) Data System to analyze the amount of food available for
consumption and the dietary status of Americans. The first series, the core
Food Availability data, is the only source of time series data on the food
available for human consumption in the United States. This series measures
supplies moving through production and trade channels for domestic
consumption. It is not a direct measure of actual consumption but is useful
to understand trends over time. The analysis used this series to examine the
amount of food available for consumption per capita.
The second series, the Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data, adjusts the
Food Availability data for spoilage and other losses and converts the data to
daily per capita amounts for comparison with Federal dietary recommenda-
tions. This series is useful in approximating the amount of food Americans,
on average, consume on a daily basis and in estimating whether Americans
are meeting the Federal dietary recommendations for each food group and
for oils.
The third series, the Nutrient Availability data, calculated by USDA’s Center
for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, uses the Food Availability data to calcu-
late the amounts per capita per day of food energy (calories) and 27 nutri-
ents and dietary components (i.e., protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and
minerals) in the Nation’s food supply. The analysis used the nutrient avail-
ability data to estimate the percent of calories contributed by fat and satu-
rated fat in the average American’s diet.
