The Guidelines also recommend choosing a variety of types of fruits and
vegetables because some fruits and vegetables are higher in certain vitamins
and minerals than others. In particular, the Guidelines encourage Americans
to select from all five vegetable subgroups several times a week because
each subgroup provides a somewhat different array of nutrients. For
example, the recommended weekly intake of vegetables for persons on a
2,000-calorie-per-day diet consists of dark-green vegetables (3 cups), orange
vegetables (2 cups), legumes (i.e., dry beans, peas, and lentils) (3 cups),
starchy vegetables (3 cups), and other vegetables (6.5 cups). Of the five
vegetable subgroups, starchy vegetables, particularly potatoes, dominated
vegetable consumption, accounting for approximately a third of the total and
slightly above the recommended level (fig. 3). Legumes had the lowest esti-
mated consumption level. Overall, Americans consumed a limited variety of
vegetables.
Like vegetable consumption, the bulk of fruit consumption came from a
limited variety of fresh and processed fruits. For example, 5 out of the 62
items covered in the loss-adjusted food availability data accounted for
more than half (54 percent) of daily fruit intake in 2005—orange juice
(20 percent), fresh apples (13 percent), bananas (9 percent), apple juice
(8 percent), and fresh grapes (5 percent).
