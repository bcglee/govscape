Abstract
This report examines major trends in the amount of food available for consumption in
the United States between 1970 and 2005 using data from the ERS Food Availability
(Per Capita) Data System. The report also estimates whether Americans are meeting
Federal dietary recommendations for each of the major food groups by comparing the
data with dietary recommendations in the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and
the MyPyramid Food Guidance System. Findings show that Americans do not meet the
Federal dietary recommendations. In order to meet them, Americans would need to
substantially lower their intake of added fats, refined grains, and added sugars and
sweeteners and increase their consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-
fat milk and milk products.
Keywords: Agriculture, added fats and oils, added sugars and sweeteners, dairy,
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, dietary recommendations, eggs, food, food
consumption, fruits, meat, MyPyramid Food Guidance System, nutrients, grains,
nuts, vegetables.
