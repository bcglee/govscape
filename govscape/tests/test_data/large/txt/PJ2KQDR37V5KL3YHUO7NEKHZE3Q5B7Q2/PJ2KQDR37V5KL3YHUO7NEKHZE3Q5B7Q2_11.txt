Consumers Are Eating More Refined
Grains but Not Enough Whole Grains
The total amount of food grains available for consumption in the United
States increased 41 percent over the past three decades according to ERS’s
food availability data. Grain availability grew from 137 pounds per person
(unadjusted for waste and spoilage) in 1970 to 192 pounds in 2005 (table 2).
Of this 56-pound increase, 36 percent was from corn products (snacks, for
example), 34 percent was from white and whole-wheat flour, 24 percent was
from rice, and 8 percent was from durum flour (pasta, for example). Esti-
mated availability of rye flour, barley products, and oat products remained
relatively constant. Although the amount of rice and corn products available
for consumption almost tripled between 1970 and 2005, the relative impor-
tance of the different food grains remained unchanged, with wheat main-
taining its dominant share of total grains available for consumption (fig. 2).
The 2005 Dietary Guidelines provided, for the first time, specific dietary
recommendations for whole grains. The Guidelines recommend that half of
the daily grain allowance be from whole grains. For example, the Guidelines
recommend that Americans on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet consume
6 ounce-equivalents (oz-eq) of grains per day, at least 3 oz-eq of which
should be whole grains. The goal of the recommendation is to encourage
Americans to eat more whole grains for their nutritional benefits. Whole
grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients, such as calcium,
magnesium, and potassium. Daily intake of at least 3 oz-eq or more of
whole grains per day may help an individual with weight control and can
reduce the risk of several chronic diseases.
According to ERS’s loss-adjusted food availability data, Americans, on
average, consumed 7.5 oz-eq of grains per day, mostly refined grains. The
database has some significant data gaps for whole grains, such as popcorn,
wheat products, and other products, and, therefore, the data do not provide a
comprehensive estimate of the per capita consumption of whole grains.
When considering both the whole grains covered in the data and those
omitted, we estimate that Americans consume 0.9 oz-eq of whole grains—a
far cry from the recommended 3 oz-eq of whole-grains for a 2,000-calorie- 4Putnam et al. (2002) estimated that
per-day diet.4Also, if we add the estimated 0.6 oz-eq from the missing Americans consumed 0.6 oz-eq of
whole-grains per person per day in
whole-grain foods to the 7.5 oz-eq included in the database, we estimate
2000 that were not included in the
that the new total for grains would be 8.1 oz-eq in 2005. In short, we found
loss-adjusted food availability data.
that Americans are eating more than double the recommended amount of
Buzby et al. (2006) estimated that
refined grains per day while eating a third of the recommended amount of 0.261 oz-eq of whole-wheat flour and
whole grains. whole-wheat flour products are cov-
ered in the food availability database
by using the estimated per capita con-
sumption of 5.22 oz-eq of wheat flour
per person and the 5-percent industry
estimate of whole-wheat flour as a
share of domestically milled wheat
(Buzby et al., 2006). If the missing
whole-grain foods of 0.6 oz-eq were
added to the 0.261 oz-eq already cov-
ered in the data, we estimate that the
new total for whole grains would be
about 0.9 oz-eq in 2005.
