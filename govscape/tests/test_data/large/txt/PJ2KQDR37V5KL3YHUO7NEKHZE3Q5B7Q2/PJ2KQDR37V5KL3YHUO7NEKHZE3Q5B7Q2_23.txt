Added Sugars and Sweeteners Up 19 Percent
Added sugars and sweeteners (or caloric sweeteners) include refined cane
and beet sugars, corn sweeteners, and edible syrups added to processed
foods and beverages but do not include dietary sugars found naturally in
foods, such as in fruits. According to the food availability data, per capita
availability of added sugars and sweeteners totaled 142 pounds in 2005, 7
percent less than the 1999 record high of 151 pounds per person, but 19
percent more than in 1970 (table 8).
Perhaps the most interesting change in added sugars and sweeteners
between 1970 and 2005 is that annual per capita corn sweetener availability
increased 387 percent while per capita availability of refined cane and beet
sugars (i.e., sucrose) declined 38 percent (fig. 7). This increase in corn
sweeteners was driven mostly by increased use of high-fructose corn syrup
(HFCS). Between 1970 and 2005, HFCS’s share of all corn sweeteners grew
from 3 to 76 percent. Prior to the early 1980s, most food industries used
sucrose instead of corn sweeteners. By the mid-1980s, industries had
switched to corn sweeteners, particularly HFCS, a low-cost substitute for
sugar in beverages. Today, the U.S. soft drink industry is the largest user of
HFCS, followed by the processed food and baking industries.
The Dietary Guidelines do not provide quantitative recommendations for
added sugars but rather advise Americans to choose and prepare foods and
beverages with little added sugars or caloric sweeteners, such as amounts
suggested by the USDA’s Food Guide in Appendix A-3 of the Dietary
Guidelines. For example, Americans on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet who
divide their discretionary calorie allowance equally between solid fats and
added sugars should limit consumption of added sugars to 8 teaspoons per
day to comply with the Guidelines. According to the loss-adjusted food
availability data, Americans consumed 30 teaspoons of added sugars and
sweeteners per person per day in 2005. This amount suggests that Ameri-
cans, on average, are consuming more than triple the amount recommended.
Thirty teaspoons of added sugars and sweeteners are equivalent to 477 calo-
ries per day, or about 24 percent of the total daily caloric intake for a person
on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet.
