site.
Establishment
Tall oatgrass is easily established, adapted to
excessively drained low fertility soils, and compatible
with legumes. A firm, weed-free seedbed is
necessary for good stands. Spring seedings produce
best results as the seedlings are not winter hardy.
Seeding rates should range from 5 to 8 pounds pure
live seed using hulled seed. Seed should be planted
approximately 1/4 inch deep and cultipacked.
Management
Apply lime and fertilizer according to soil test results

Erosion control: Tall oatgrass is a useful
conservation grass for cover and forage on surface
mined lands and marginal pastureland. Pests and Potential Problems
Tall oatgrass is highly resistant to disease and insects.
