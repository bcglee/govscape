HOPEFIELD SELECTION
TRAILING WILDBEAN (Strophostyles helvula)
Description: Hopefield Selection trailing wildbean, is a native warm-season legume with trailing
and twisting stems. Leaves are alternate and trifoliate. Flower racemes are axillary, ascending on a
long peduncle. Flowers are purplish. Legume pod is sessile, linear, and cylinderical shaped. It
contains several seeds and shatters readily upon ripening. Seeds are usually pubescent. Trailing
wildbean produces hard seeds, with approximately one-half germinating the first year.
Uses: Hopefield Selection can be used for stabilizing eroded areas such as those associated with
timber harvesting operations. It can also be used for vegetating deep , sandy sites, and as a food
source for upland game birds.
Soil Adaptation: Adapted to a wide range of upland soils but prefers sandy soils.
Cultural Specifications
Method of Establishment: Seed.
Seedbed Preparation: Prepare a moderately firm, clean seedbed.
Seeding Date: April-May 1.
Seeding Rate: 10 lb./acre in a mixture. For seed production seed at 15 lb./acre in 40 inch rows.
Inoculate seed with Strophostyles Special 1.
Fertility Requirements: Use soil test recommendations or apply 300 lb./acre of 10-20-20 or similar
analysis for establishing critical areas and seed production fields.
pH requirement: 5.5-6.5.
Management in subsequent years: To encourage volunteer stands, lightly disk the field in early
spring and fertilize according to its intended conservation use.
Seeding Harvesting: Hopefield selection is an indeterminate seeder (seed does not mature at the
same time) and therefore a timely harvest will be important to obtain a good yield. Harvest efficiency
is improved by suppressing vegetative growth by spraying seed production block with paraquat at
2.5 pints/acre, one week prior to harvesting.
