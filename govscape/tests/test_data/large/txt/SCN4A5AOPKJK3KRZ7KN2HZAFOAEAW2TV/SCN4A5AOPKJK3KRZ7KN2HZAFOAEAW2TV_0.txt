Further Evidence for the Existence of Three Types of Starch Granules in Wheat. Although
l
starch comprises up to 62% of the weight of the mature wheat kernel, little is known about how
starch forms within the seed. We used transmission electron microscopy to follow starch
formation in structures in the kernel called amyloplasts from the day of flowering through grain
maturation. The synthesis of the large, Type A starch granules was observed during the first week
after flowering. Synthesis of medium, Type B granules was observed to begin from 10 to 12 days
after flowering and the synthesis of a fraction of tiny granules (diameter .25 micrometers or less),
proposed as Type C, began from 17 to 21 days after flowering. The small size of Type C particles
would produce a large area to volume ratio which may impact important properties such as water
absorption, baking performance, etc.

Development of an Objective (NIR) Test for Bread Staling. Bread staling is one of the most
l
common problems in bread storage. It affects bread texture properties such as firmness and taste.
Bread gets firmer as the storage time increases. Bread firmness, as measured by a texture
analyzer, has been commonly used to predict bread staling. However, this technique has many
disadvantages. A trend always exists in a loaf with firmer slices in the center and its accuracy
decreases when measuring samples made from different batches. This study investigated the
potential of visible and NIR reflectance spectroscopy to detect bread staling. Results show that
NIR analysis could predict bread staling more accurately and precisely than the texture analyzer.

Male and Female Red Flour Beetles Respond Differently to Pheromone Traps. The red flour
l
beetle is a major pest of food processing facilities and warehouses, but the pheromone lure used
for the monitoring of this insect is widely perceived as not very effective. We are investigating
how red flour beetle adults behave around pheromone traps by asking: over what range are
insects attracted, what is the probability of capture, and how is insect response to traps influenced
by the use of different combinations of attractant (pheromone, food oil, or pheromone + food oil
combinations)? Results to date indicate that females are more likely to be captured in traps with
the pheromone and food oil combination, but males are more likely to be captured in traps with
