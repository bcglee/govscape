pheromone alone. However, even when looking at only the best attractant for a given sex, only
25% of individuals released 25 cm from the trap were captured. Further experiments will be
performed to determine how mating status, starvation level, and air movement influence
responsiveness to the traps. With this information we will be better able to implement and
interpret monitoring programs.

New Tool Developed for Plant DNA Analysis. A high-throughput DNA extraction procedure
l
was developed for wheat that can be applied without requiring greenhouse space or long growing
periods. Seeds were germinated in 8-well tissue culture plates and 4-day-old seedling tissue was
used to extract the DNA using sodium hydroxide methodology. Approximately 1 microgram of
DNA was isolated per 10 milligrams of tissue at a cost of about $ 0.10. The DNA quality was
found to be consistent with that obtained from either fresh or stored tissue extracts. This
technique allows one person to extract nearly 1,000 stable DNA samples daily at a very low cost.

Update on the Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Project. For the past 4 years,
l
an area-wide IPM project for stored grain was developed and tested in 20 grain elevators in
Kansas and Oklahoma. During this study, we have taken thousands of grain samples in concrete
elevator silos. We found that there is little correlation between the need to fumigate because of
the presence of large numbers of insects and whether or not the grain is actually fumigated.
Fumigations tended to be based on past experience or were calendar-based. True integrated pest
management requires insect sampling, risk benefit analysis and, often, the use of multiple control
tactics. In the study, moving grain samples, probe trap, and vacuum probe samples were
compared. We found that the best sampling method for estimating insect density without moving
the grain was the vacuum sampler. In new grain, insect densities were highest in the top half of
the grain mass and decreased with depth. Sampling the top 12 meters instead of the entire 30
meters greatly reduced sampling time.

New Gene for Wheat Curl Mite Resistance is Mapped. Wheat curl mite (WCM) is a serious
l
pest of wheat in North America. It is the only vector known to transmit wheat streak mosaic virus
which consistently reduces wheat yields. Genetic resistance to WCM has shown direct and
indirect suppression of mites and wheat streak mosaic virus in the field. We mapped a new gene,
designated Cmc4, in common wheat that provides resistance to six known strains of WCM. Our
analysis showed that Cmc4 is located on chromosome 6D and is inherited as a single dominant
gene. (Gina Brown-Guedira, phone: 785-532-7260, email: gbg@ksu.edu)
High Speed Sorter Detects Karnal Bunt and Wheat Color. A high-speed optical sorter was
l
used to remove kernels infected with Karnal bunt from 1800 g wheat samples in less than one
minute per sample. When the sorter removed about 8% or more of the sample, the reject portion
contained 100% of the bunted kernels. Concentrating the bunted kernels in a smaller sample size
reduced sample inspection time and inspection errors. One high-speed sorter can process up to
