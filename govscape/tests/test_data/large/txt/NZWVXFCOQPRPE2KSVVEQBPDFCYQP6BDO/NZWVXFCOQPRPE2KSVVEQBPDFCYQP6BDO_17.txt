remote and the land of low-use potential. It was characterized by
sandy loam soil with a pH of 8.0 and an organic carbon content of 0.95
percent. The herbicide formulation contained equal amounts of the
n-butyl esters of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and was applied by simulating sub-
soil injection at rates as high as 4,000 Ibs ai/A. The replicated plots
were periodically sampled and the concentration of ester and acid forms
of the herbicides was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Levels
of the toxic contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were
also measured in certain selected samples. Degradation of both ester
and acid form of each herbicide was initially rapid (1st year) but
tended to taper off in succeeding years. Strict exponential decay
kinetics were not followed. Application rate had only minimal effect on
the rate or pattern of degradation. The rate of disappearance of 2,4-D
was slightly higher than that for 2,4,5~T. In those samples in which it
was measured, significant degradation of TCDD was also noted. Soil
penetration of the herbicides as either acid or ester forms was negli-
gible.
