correlation between elevated serum cholesterol and coronary disease,
this finding was indeed encouraging. A positive correlation was also
observed between periods of stress (academics, hell week, and Basic
Cadet Training) and average cholesterol and uric acid levels. This
finding may be useful in diagnosing emotional stress when the patient
(subject) is not aware that he is under severe stress conditions. A
third general finding was that there was an overall average weight
increase in the subjects of this study. While this may not be unexpected,
determinations of body fat revealed there was an unexpected decrease in
this parameter. Apparently, this weight increase was due to an increase
in muscle tissue rather than in fatty deposits. Overall, the data from
this study tend to lend support to the current diet and physical condition-
ing programs at USAFA. Other findings will undoubtedly be forthcoming
after all the data have been evaluated.

The major effort on this project this year has been to determine
what effects non-potable sewage effluent have on ecosystems (e.g.,
parade fields and golf course) where it is used for irrigation. Data
collected so far indicate that inclusions in the water are causing a
unfavorable shift in species composition of grasses and are causing
damage to tree species. The non-potable irrigation water includes high
concentrations of phosphate, nitrate, chlorine, salt, and many heavy
