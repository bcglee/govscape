cellular ultrastructure (adrenal cortex, testes, liver and kidney) will
be investigated following completion of the study. Animal weight data
collected over a nine-week period indicated no effect due to TCDD
applications, relative to controls.

1. Backing Strength of Masonry Shear Walls
Principal Investigator: Captain Richard H. Jolley, Department
of Civil Engineering, Engineering Mechanics and Materials
Sponsored by the USAF Academy
Increased interest in using masonry for load-bearing structural
systems has necessitated review of existing code design criteria and
establishing improved design techniques. The objectives of this project
are to (1) formulate a failure criteria for walls subjected to "in
plane" loads and (2) establish a deflection prediction criteria for
walls subjected to "in plane" loads.
The final report is complete and available to any agency or
interested individual. Contact USAF Academy, DFCEM.
