metals, Soil analysis indicated progressive changes in soil chemical
composition that may result in degradation of soil quality. Continua-
tion of the program is being proposed to further delineate cause and
effect relationships and to provide corrective measures.
11. An Evaluation of Current Capabilities in Genetics and
MDlecular Biology
Principal Investigators: Captain Lawrence J. Biever, Captain
Alvin L. Young, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene L. Arnold, and Major
William C. Wilson, Department of Chemistry and Biological
Sciences.
Sponsored by the Defense Intelligence Agency.
This study has been initiated to determine the state-of-the-art
of current biological technology. An evaluation of the results of the
application of current biological research to agriculture, industry,
medicine, and the military has been made. The study included an evaluation
of the international political, economic, social, and military impact of

Data collected from current literature and contacts with
researchers has been evaluated by DPCBS personnel. An interim report has
been submitted. The final report will be submitted in June, 1976. A
follow-on project has been proposed by the sponsor.

Biodegradation
Principal Investigators: Captain Alvin L. Young, and Lieutenant
Colonel Eugene L. Arnold, Department of Chemistry and Biological
Sciences.
Sponsored by Air Force Logistics Command/DS.
In August 1972, a site for soil incorporation of 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T herbicides was selected on the Air Force Logistics Command Test
Range Complex, Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The site was considered
