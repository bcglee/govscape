The Environmental Protection Agency currently limits the
commercial use of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) herbicide
due to the lack of environmental data on the teratogenic (birth-deforming)
contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) found in many
2,4,5-T formulations. The consequence of such a use limitation directly
affects the fate of a large USAF surplus inventory of Herbicide Orange
(a2,4,5-T formulation).
In a study to determine potential plant uptake of TCDD, a 2,000
pounds per acre equivalent application of Herbicide Orange, containing
14 parts per million (ppm) C-14 labelled TCDD, was placed 4" beneath
the soil surface in specially constructed growth boxes, containing 100
plants of Sorghum, Sorghum vulgare, per box. The plants were grown under
controlled environmental conditions for a period of nine weeks, at which
time they were harvested and assayed for TCDD uptake. Analysis of the
plant tissue (exclusive of root systems) prior to hexane extraction, and
