after hexane extraction for four hours in a Soxhlet extraction apparatus,
indicated the presence of an amount of C-14 activity that was equivalent
to 430 parts per trillion (ppt) of TCDD in the plant material. This
represents the maximum amount of TCDD that could be present in the plant
material, but could also represent (1) the preferential plant uptake of
a minor impurity in the TCDD formulation that was applied to the soil;
(2) a metabolic breakdown product that was formed in the plant material
after TCDD incorporation; or (3) the preferential uptake of a soil
decomposition or soil microbial degradation product of the original TCDD
placed in the soil.

In support of research on the biological effects of animals
exposed to TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), ultrastructural
studies were initiated on beach mice, Peromyscus polionotus, collected
from a herbicide-equipment testing range (Test Area C-52_A, Eglin AFB,
Florida). Liver tissue from 30 mice (from the test and a control area)
were examined with an electron microscope for possible ultrastructural
changes in mitochondria and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Similar data were collected from 22 mice brought from the field into the
laboratory and exposed to 30 days of external dusting with alumina gel
(with or without 2.5 ppb TCDD).
Five representative electron micrographs were made from the liver
tissue of each animal and the data were obtained from each micrograph
