using a technique known as "point counting". With this method, a trans-
parent grid of intersecting lines was placed at random over the micro-
graphs and all the line intersections which were over the required cell
structures were counted. The total area of the cytoplasm was then
measured in the same manner. An analysis of variance was conducted to
determine whether there was a statistically significant difference
between populations of cells, i.e., percentage mitochondria and smooth
and rough endoplasmic reticulum, removed from experimental and control
animals. Analysis of data indicated no statistical differences between
field control and field treatment animals, although differences were
noted between field and laboratory animals.

A long-term study of the possible biological hazards of pelage
exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been
initiated on the beachmouse, Peromyscus polionotus. Animals were
divided into three experimental groups: untreated controls, a "treated"
control group dusted with diatomaceous earth, and a "treated" group
dusted with diatomaceous earth containing 2.5 parts per billion TCDD.
The animals were dusted three times per week; the TCDD concentration
simulating an exposure that was twice that expected from normal rangeland
application rates of 0.1 parts per million TCDD contaminated 2,4,5-T
herbicide. The effect of TCDD on animal weight, blood components, and
