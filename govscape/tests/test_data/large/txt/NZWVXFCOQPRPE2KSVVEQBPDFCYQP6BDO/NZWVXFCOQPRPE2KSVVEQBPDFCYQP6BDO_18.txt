During this past year species diversities and food chain studies
were conducted in two aquatic ecosystems draining the unique one-square
mile military test area (Test Area C-52A, Eglin AFB, FL) that received
160,948 Ibs 2,4,5-T and 169,292 Ibs 2,4-D herbicide during the period
1962-1970. Significant levels (10-710 parts per trillion, ppt) 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) were found within the top six inches
of the test area soil. Erosion of soil occurred into a pond on the test
area and into a stream immediately adjacent to the area. TCDD levels of
10-35 ppt were found in silt of the aquatic systems, but only at the
point where eroded soil entered the water. Species diversity studies of
the stream were conducted in 1969, 1970, 1973 and 1974. Insect larvae,
snails, diving beetles, crayfish, tadpoles, and major fish species from
both aquatic systems were analyzed for TCDD. Species diversity studies
indicated no significant change in the composition of ichthyofauna
between these dates or a control stream. Concentrations of TCDD (12 ppt)
were found in only two species of fish from the stream, Notropis
hypselopterus, Gunther (sailfin shiner), and Gambusia affinis, Baird an
Girard (mosquitof ish). Samples of skin, muscle, gonads, and gut were
obtained from Lepomis punctatus, Valenciennes (spotted sunfish), from the
test grid pond. Levels of TCDD in those body parts were 4,4,18 and 85
ppt, respectively. Gross pathological observations of the sunfish revealed
no significant lesions or abnormalities.
