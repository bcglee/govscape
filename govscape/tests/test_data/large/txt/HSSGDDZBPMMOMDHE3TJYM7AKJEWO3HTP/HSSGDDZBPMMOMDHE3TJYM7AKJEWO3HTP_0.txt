It was important that Florida make clear what concern AHBs
really represent to avoid a negative impact on the state’s resi-

but remains calm when AHBs arrive.
On the other hand, some municipalities have reacted by trying
to ban beekeeping in an attempt to keep AHBs from arriving. In
reality, keeping the ecological niche filled with strong, healthy
stocks of European honey bees is more effective in delaying the
advance of AHBs.
