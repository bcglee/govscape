Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 15
Susan Krebs-Smith, PhD, Chief of the Risk Factor Monitoring and Methods Branch in the
Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences at the National Cancer Institute (NCI),
spoke about distributions of usual food intakes in relation to the MyPyramid recommendations.
As the 2005 Dietary Guidelines pointed out, MyPyramid recommendations are similar to the
DASH diet and are consistent with recommendations to control obesity, diabetes, heart disease,
stroke, hypertension, cancer, and osteoporosis. She noted that the recommendations depend on
appropriate energy intake levels and, within a given calorie level, eating too much in one area
necessarily restricts intake in another. Usual intakes over time are the measure of interest.
Twenty-four-hour recalls have advantages, but people do not eat the same thing every day; so
they are a snapshot rather than an average. In other words, they measure usual dietary intake
with some error. This source of error affects usual food intake distribution estimates. The mean
of the 24-hour recalls can be used as an estimate of the mean of usual intake, but using
unadjusted 24-hour recalls overestimates the portion of the population with very low or very high
intakes.
A special issue of The Journal of Nutrition was published in 2001 to provide information on the
diets of Americans and how they related to the Dietary Guidelines. A recurring theme in the data
gaps and limitations sections was that it was impossible to assess distributions of usual dietary
intake. But now NCI has developed the methodology to estimate usual dietary intake of foods
for the population, using two 24-hour recalls.
The data presented today uses this methodology and data from the 2001-2004 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey and the MyPyramid Equivalents Database. The tables for
nearly all the food groups in the MyPyramid Equivalents Database and the percentage of energy
from macronutrients are also available on the NCI website.
Since MyPyramid has no single set of recommendations, but rather recommendations that vary
based on appropriate energy intake levels, the distribution of intakes are compared to the most
conservative cut point. For consideration of insufficiency, intakes were compared to the
minimum recommendation for each age/sex group. For examining the possibility of excessive
intakes, the maximum recommendation was used.
For total fruit, intakes were below the recommendation up through the 75th percentile for most
sex/age groups. Children do somewhat better because they tend to drink more juice than adults
do.
For vegetable subgroups, including dark green, orange, legumes, and other vegetables, most
people are below the recommendation. For dark green and orange vegetables, intakes through
the 95th percentile are below the recommended amount among nearly all sex/age groups.
Young children do slightly better with orange vegetables because their recommendations are
lower, and vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes are typically given to young children. For
adolescents and young adults, intakes of total vegetables through the 95th percentile fall short of
minimum recommendations.
