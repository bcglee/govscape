Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 19
Dr. Achterberg hoped that as these datasets are built they will integrate with other existing data.
Dr. Britten said the tiers project uses NHANES survey codes so it can be integrated.
Dr. Appel asked about putting nuts, seeds, and legumes into their own food group. Dr. Britten
said it might work better to make recommendations within the meat and bean group,
recommending more consumption of some subgroups and less of others. Since most people are
not vegetarians, legumes may remain in the vegetable group, since they have vegetable-like
nutrients. Products that cross groups are always an issue. Dr. Appel asked about reorganizing
the food groups, at least the meat and beans group, by origin, for example, meat versus vegetable
protein. Dr. Britten said that would suggest restructuring all of the food groups. Chair Van Horn
said creating a protein group might be less confusing to consumers.
Chair Van Horn further commented that, since snacks make up so much of the diet, it is no
longer clear what constitutes a meal, and the tiering of health benefits of different foods is
important.
Dr. Nelson suggested renaming the meat and beans group to emphasize plant-based proteins.
She commented that the Pyramid is already confusing without tiers. She asked if there is
evidence that the Pyramid increases awareness of calories and suggested an image to raise
calorie awareness. Dr. Britten said SoFAAS is a major problem with caloric intake, and tiering
is a way to raise awareness of that. Dr. Nelson asked about research on the Pyramid’s impact on
food choices. Dr. Britten said there was little data on that.
Sodium, Potassium, and Water Subcommittee
Discussion Leader: Larry Appel
Dr. Appel said thirst and usual drinking behavior, especially fluid consumption with meals, is
sufficient to maintain normal hydration. According to the IOM Committee on Fluid and
Electrolytes, there is no chronic hydration problem in normal, healthy people. He said people
with access to fluids who are not exposed to heat stress consume adequate levels of water.
However, people exposed to heat or stress or performing sustained vigorous activity should
purposefully drink water. The subcommittee did an initial literature search and a conference call
with Dr. Michael Sawka, an expert on hydration, who agreed with the subcommittee’s
conclusions. The subcommittee is looking for data on increased fluid intake preventing kidney
stones. So far, no convincing literature has been found. The subcommittee is also looking into
water in the elderly, water with meals, the nutritional content of fortified water, and the
recommendation for non-caloric fluid sources. He opened the floor for questions before moving
on to potassium and sodium.
Dr. Slavin said the Carbohydrate and Protein subcommittee is looking at artificial sweeteners,
which may overlap with non-caloric fluids.
Dr. Rimm asked if there was data on water and bladder cancer. He also suggested looking at the
affect of water on the diet, regarding food choices and satiety. Dr. Appel said a literature search
could be done.
