and meats and meat alternates. They tend to have excessive intake of calories from SoFAAS and
from saturated fat.
Discussion
Dr. Perez-Escamilla noted that it is clear that people underreport energy intakes as a function of
their body mass index (BMI) category, but do we know if the macronutrient distribution of their
reported food intake is more reliable? Dr. Krebs-Smith said there is little information on
differential under-reporting of nutrients; however, there is less under-reporting of protein. If
under-reporting were consistent across the board, there would be no difference. Keep in mind
that some participants who are overweight may be on diets and cutting back on calories, or they
may under-report because of social desirability. One thing of interest is that they are under-
consuming the nutrient-bearing food groups, and still over-consuming solid fats and added
sugars, despite the underreporting.
Dr. Fukagawa asked about subgroup analyses in terms of differences among regions, ethnic
groups, socioeconomic class, or vegans vs. omnivores. Dr. Krebs-Smith said getting that
information takes a lot of computing time and would require a very large sample size. Some of
these analyses may be possible with four years of data. Regional differences cannot be
calculated because of the way the sample is drawn.
Dr. Rimm asked if the excessive intake of SoFAAS was more from fats, sugars, or alcohol. Dr.
Krebs-Smith said that data on solid fats, added sugars, and alcohol are shown in separate tables.
Dr. Nelson asked if there was a way to look into where the SoFAAS were coming from--from
snacking, meals, desserts, or foods eaten away from home. Dr. Krebs-Smith said she does not
know of any reports on when or where the calories are consumed. However, from other analyses
they have done, it can be seen that a lot of the solid fat is coming from fattier meats, milk
products containing fat, and grain-based desserts—such as cakes and cookies.
Dr. Appel asked about trans fats and other fatty acids. Dr. Krebs-Smith said individual fatty
acids can be analyzed, but there is not yet a complete database on the amount of trans-fatty acids
in foods.
Dr. Nickols-Richardson asked what the food group and nutrient information tell when looked at
collectively—are certain groups more at risk? The nutrient needs could be met if the diet had
better balance. Dr. Krebs-Smith said with MyPyramid, it has been demonstrated that nutrient
needs can be met with appropriate choices. The public doesn’t seem to get the message of how
small the allotment of discretionary calories is.
Dr. Appel asked if a breakdown of the total calories from every food group was available. Dr.
Krebs-Smith said that information was not available. Chair Van Horn said it would be useful to
have the data to show how people who avoid certain foods don’t meet nutrient needs. We all
know that it is possible to be overweight and undernourished. To use our own data to document
that could be very compelling because people don’t quite understand that concept.
