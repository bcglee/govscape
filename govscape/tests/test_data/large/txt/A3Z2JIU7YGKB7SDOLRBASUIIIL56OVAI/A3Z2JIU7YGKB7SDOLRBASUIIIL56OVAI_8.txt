Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 9
pressure and hypertension rates. She referred to studies in which vegetarianism is linked to
reduced diabetes, overweight, and obesity. She urged the Committee to publicize the risks
related to consumption of excessive red and processed meat. She also asked that plant-based
protein sources not be categorized in the meat food group.
Adriane Griffen, Director of Health Promotion and Partnerships for the Spina Bifida
Association, urged the Committee to update the 2010 Guidelines with a specific
recommendation of at least 400 micrograms of folic acid for women of childbearing age and to
incorporate messages about the importance of folic acid consumption into materials associated
with the Guidelines. Adequate daily folic acid consumption significantly reduces the risk of
spina bifida and related birth defects. Only a third of US women get the recommended amount
of folic acid every day, and the Guidelines can educate women on the nutrient’s importance.
Cathy Kapica, Vice President of Global Health and Wellness at Ketchum, spoke on behalf
of the Canned Food Alliance. Urged that the Guidelines continue to include and promote
canned products that are consistent with the overall dietary recommendations. Studies have
confirmed the benefits of canned foods. The canning process locks in nutrients at the peak of
freshness and extends the shelf life. Canned foods are comparable in nutrient contribution to
fresh, or frozen foods, and some canned foods have more antioxidants than their fresh
counterparts, and the heat treatment process enhances the bioavailability of some nutrients.
Canned fruits and vegetables are affordable and do not contribute significantly to America’s
sodium and sugar intake. Although there have been many food-borne illness outbreaks linked to
produce, none of them have been linked to canned products.
Catherine Ruhl of the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetrics, and Neonatal Nurses,
spoke for the National Council on Folic Acid. Folic Acid is necessary for proper cell growth,
and it helps prevent neural tube birth defects that occur early in pregnancy. She supported the
recommendation that Americans consume 400 micrograms of synthetic folic acid daily, either
from fortified foods or multivitamins. This dosage can reduce neural tube birth defects by 70
percent.
Andrew Shao, Vice President of Scientific and Regulatory Affairs for the Council for
Responsible Nutrition, noted that Americans often fail to meet the recommended intakes for a
variety of nutrients and suggested that the Committee recommend a multivitamin to fill the gaps.
He pointed out that adequate nutrient intake is linked to reduced risk of chronic disease. He
supported the 2005 Guidelines’ recognition of dietary supplements and encouraged the
Committee to clarify the role of dietary supplements.
Saurabh Dalal spoke on behalf of the Vegetarian Union of North America, the
International Vegetarian Union, and the Vegetarian Society of DC. She said a vegetarian
diet has health advantages and that eating animal products is detrimental due to increased
cholesterol, lack of fiber, and diet-related diseases. She asked the Committee to emphasize plant
foods and alternatives to animal products. She added that a vegetarian diet can provide for all
nutritional needs. She urged that the Committee incorporate a vegan diet into the Guidelines.
