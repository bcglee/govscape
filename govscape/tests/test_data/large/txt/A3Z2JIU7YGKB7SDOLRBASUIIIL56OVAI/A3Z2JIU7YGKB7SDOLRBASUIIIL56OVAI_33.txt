Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 34
form of food allergy, and food allergies may be linked to an increased risk of asthma. The
subcommittee is looking at a number of questions related to food allergies: What is known about
food allergies? What do consumers know about food allergies? Are they reading the labels for
the products? Are all the components that may be allergens in the food declared? Food labeling
requirements regarding allergens in food was updated in 2006 by the FDA. The risks associated
with exposure can be very high. The greatest risk for exposure is in children, especially as they
start making their own decisions.
The subcommittee wants to look at best practices in schools, homes, daycare centers, and camps.
The subcommittee is looking at practices that can be implemented, such as separation of foods,
utensils and dishes. The subcommittee will look at various outcomes and different environments
and exposure opportunities. Morbidity and mortality will be examined, and the subcommittee
will come up with recommendations.
Dr. Clemens moved on to food technology. The Food Code of 2005 was used in the 2005
Guidelines. Since 2005, there have been developments in cleaning reagents that can be used that
are environmentally friendly and can reduce the potential pathogen load in the home. The
subcommittee is looking at technologies that can improve food safety in the home while
increasing the shelf life of foods, such as smart packaging and sensors that tell the microbial
load. Color-coded cutting boards encourage separation of food and some have an antimicrobial
agent incorporated.
Good hygiene is the ultimate safety practice, and that means understanding the risks associated
with different storage environments. The subcommittee plans to develop a clear and concise
recommendation to help consumers make good decisions about continuous hygiene, cleaning,
and cost-effective materials for a safer home. The subcommittee also wants to compare various
available technologies and make advisories on the technologies available and accessible to
various homes. Data on this is limited, but there will be an NEL search. The subcommittee
wants to recommend best practices to prevent contamination in the home. As technologies
become available, they can be evaluated for effectiveness with the NEL team.
Dr. Perez-Escamilla said the 2005 Committee recommended the four steps of the FightBAC!Â®
campaign. The steps are sound, and the subcommittee will not recommend they be changed.
The Guidelines also included hand-washing and fruit and vegetable-washing protocols. The
subcommittee wants to look for new data supporting different protocols or reaffirming this one.
The 2005 Committee also dealt with storage of foods, especially those at risk for Listeria.
Consumers could benefit from specific information. Data will be reviewed to provide consumers
with storage times. Listeria is important to address, and the subcommittee will look for other
emerging or newly-antibiotic-resistant pathogens with an NEL update. The subcommittee wants
to know the extent to which consumers follow proper food storage preparation and handling
techniques and procedures, with the population broken down by race, ethnicity, gender, age, and
region when possible. Very little is known about outbreaks in the home. The subcommittee will
look for data, but not much is expected. The subcommittee is asking what food storage,
preparation, and handling techniques are associated with food safety outcomes. He opened the
floor for discussion.
