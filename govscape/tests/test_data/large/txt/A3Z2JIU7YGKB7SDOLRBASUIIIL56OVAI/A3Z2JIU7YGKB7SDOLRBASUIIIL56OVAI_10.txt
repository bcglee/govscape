public some advice on their value. He asked that the Guidelines consider such systems and to
address relevant principles for food-level guidance, which would help the public choose among
systems.
Mindy Kursban appeared as a private citizen. She told of her experience of switching to a
vegan diet to improve her health and lose weight. Her father, who did not change his diet, has
chronic diet-related diseases. She asked that three recommendations be included in the 2010
Guidelines: the inclusion of information on the benefits of a vegan diet and a recommendation of
this diet for everyone, accurate information about the health risks of all meats and their non-
recommendation, and the removal of dairy from the Pyramid and of recommendations that
Americans consume dairy.
Kathleen McMahon, Director of Nutrition and Scientific Affairs for the William Wrigley,
Jr., Company, suggested that chewing gum be considered for inclusion in the Guidelines. The
primary benefits of chewing gum are reduction of dental caries and as a weight management
tool. Studies show that chewing sugar-free gum after eating stimulates saliva, which neutralizes
plaque acids; clears sugars, acids, and food debris; and remineralizes the enamel. The American
Dental Association awarded a seal of acceptance to sugar-free gums. Chewing gum can help
weight management, since it can serve as a substitute for a snack and as an appetite suppressant.
Julie Obbagy, RD, Director of Scientific Affairs for the Soy Foods Association of North
America, said soy products are high in nutrients Americans should consume more of and low in
those Americans should eat less of. Soy foods contain high-quality protein equivalent to eggs
and milk. She recommended that the 2010 Dietary Guidelines feature soy foods more
prominently, to reflect changing dietary preferences.
Eva Rand, RD, said the number of obese and overweight people in the US, as well as the rates
of diet-linked disease, indicate that the Food Guide Pyramid has not been useful. None of her
patients have learned anything from the Pyramid. She said people do not understand the
Pyramid and suggested instead a Food Guide Plate. She encouraged the Committee to devote
more attention to plant-based diets.
David Easley, MD, psychiatrist at the Center for Cognitive Therapy, said food processing
removes potassium from food and replaces it with sodium. This causes intracellular loss of
potassium throughout the body. The cardiovascular effect causes tightening of muscles,
impotence, failure to respond to insulin, and obesity. In the brain, the effects of low intracellular
potassium are irreversible, causing autism, attention deficit disorder, and behavior problems.
Kathy Hoy from Produce for Better Health Foundation said the current Guidelines are solid,
overall. PBH supports continuing to base the guidelines on evidence-based science. She made
three recommendations on properly translating the messages to the consumer. First, the
Guidelines should highlight that dietary supplements do not replace fruits and vegetables.
Second, the 2010 Guidelines should not only emphasize what people should eat more of, but also
what they should eat less of. Third, she encouraged the Committee to recognize that fruits and
vegetables are under-consumed in the US. This is probably due to advertising of other, less-
