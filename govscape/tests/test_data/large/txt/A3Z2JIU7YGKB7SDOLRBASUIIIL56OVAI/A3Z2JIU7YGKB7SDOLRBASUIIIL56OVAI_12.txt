Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 13
librarian will conduct and document the literature searches in detail. When the results are
received, staff will sort them first by title, then by abstract, using the Committeeâ€™s inclusion and
exclusion criteria. The subcommittees will then review and approve the articles to be included
for the evidence-based review process. Evidence abstractors will then develop an evidence
worksheet on each study.
When the search is completed and the papers have been identified and abstracted, the Committee
will review the body of evidence and develop evidence summaries, conclusion statements with
rationale, and an evaluation of the strength of the evidence. The Committee will develop the
recommendation and supporting rationale for the Guidelines, based on all of the evidence. Once
the Committee submits its report, the work will all be publically accessible.
Discussion
Dr. Nelson said it will be necessary to tolerate some ambiguities until the science is seen and the
questions are well-defined. Ms. Lyon agreed that the questions can be refined along the way,
provided that the process remains transparent.
Dr. Appel questioned the issue of grading the evidence and noted that rating the
recommendations might reopen questions that were considered resolved. Chair Van Horn said
that rating is important, since all evidence is not equal.
Dr. Pearson asked if there will be a master document for all of the questions. Ms. Lyon said the
library portal will be online, and the subcommittees can structure them.
Dr. Perez-Escamilla asked about cases in which questions overlap. Ms. Lyon said staff has been
looking to identify issues that come up in more than one subcommittee so that the Committee
can decide how best to handle them.

Distributions of Usual Intakes of Nutrients and Food Groups in the United States
Ms. Alanna Moshfegh, Research Leader for the Food Surveys Research Group, presented
summary data from What We Eat in America, the dietary interview component of the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Annually, two days of dietary intake data
are collected on 5,000 individuals of all ages, using the Automated Multiple Pass Method
(AMPM). The first interview is conducted in person, the second by telephone. AMPM is a
computer-assisted, five-step dietary interview that includes multiple passes through the 24 hours
of the previous day. The AMPM has been validated using a biomarker for energy expenditure,
assessing mean energy intake within 11 percent of energy expenditure. Greater underreporting
was found with higher BMI classifications, but underreporting was less than 3 percent for normal
weight.
The data she presented assessed the adequacy of diets for 24 nutrients, based on the DRI
standards, in nearly 9,000 individuals one year of age or older in 2001-2002. The observations
