Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 7
Michael Greger, MD, Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for the Humane
Society of the United States, highlighted three recent studies. First was a Harvard study by L.
Djousse, et al, linking egg consumption in males to all-cause mortality, linking eating one egg a
day or more to a shorter life. He noted that eggs contain cholesterol and can contain salmonella.
The second study, by Dr. Helund, et al., concluded that incorporation of N-glycolylneuraminic
acid into some human cancers facilitates tumor progression. The only dietary source for the
substance is meat and dairy products. He suggested recommending legumes as a protein source
over meat. The third study, by Dr. Sarter, et al., showed unprecedented weight loss in obese
individuals who were encouraged to follow a vegetarian diet. The patients showed an average
weight loss of over 50 pounds at two years. He said that the vegetarian diet was linked to
longevity and encouraged the Committee to recommend a more plant-based diet.
Rob Bisceglie, Executive Director of Action for Healthy Kids, which focuses on improving
nutrition and physical activity in schools, spoke on the importance of nutrition and physical
activity to learning and the importance of stressing foods of high nutrient density. Studies have
linked diet quality to academic performance. He asked that the Committee recommend that
school-age children eat a healthy breakfast every day. He said there are few simpler, more cost-
effective interventions that can be taken. He also hoped that the Committee would reinforce the
position that physical activity plays a profound role in health. He emphasized the continued need
to encourage consumption of nutrient-dense foods. He stressed the importance of getting the
message to low-income communities in a culturally appropriate manner.
Heather Katcher from the Washington Center for Clinical Research spoke on behalf of
Barbara Wasserman, M.D., Chairperson of the Howard County Nutrition and Physical Activity
Coalition. Howard County, Maryland, has a childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity
rate of 31 percent, and Dr. Wasserman sees a lot of obesity-related medical problems. She urged
HHS and USDA to look at studies that demonstrate the benefits of plant-based diets and the
dangers of over-consumption of animal-related foods. She referred the Committee to Dr. Colin
Campbellâ€™s study linking a plant-based diet to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. She
referenced a study by Dr. Bernard et al. that showed that a low-fat vegan diet can improve
glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in those with type 2 diabetes. She said a plant-
based diet can prevent, arrest, and reverse coronary artery disease and that increased body fat
increased body fat increases the risk of certain cancers. She requested that the Committee
prepare guidelines that advocate minimizing the intake of animal-based and processed foods.
Charles Barker, Executive Vice President and Chief Science Officer at the Sugar
Association, said sugar is a safe, natural, and beneficial food ingredient. Although the
Association is concerned about obesity rates, restricting dietary sugar is an outdated and flawed
approach. Targeting a single nutrient is counterproductive, since nutritional adequacy is
determined by the totality of the diet. He referred the Committee to his written comments for
evidence. He advocated a common-sense approach to diet, stressing moderation, portion control,
physical activity, and healthy lifestyles. He asked that the updated Guidelines de-emphasize the
inordinate focus on sugar.
Alex Hershaft, PhD, President of FARM, said the epidemic of obesity and related diseases are
linked to meat and dairy products, which contain saturated fat, cholesterol, hormones, antibiotics,
