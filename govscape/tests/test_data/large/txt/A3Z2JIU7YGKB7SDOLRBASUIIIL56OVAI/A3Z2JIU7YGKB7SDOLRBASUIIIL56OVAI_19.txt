Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 20
Dr. Appel moved on to discuss potassium. He said diets rich in potassium can lower blood
pressure, reduce the effects of sodium, reduce the risk of kidney stones, and possibly decrease
bone loss. The recommendations are tentative, since the evidence is not strong. The
subcommittee recommended at least 4,700 mg of potassium. Though African Americans are
more likely to benefit from increased potassium, the literature neither enhances nor conflicts with
the recommendation. The subcommittee had a conference call with Dr. Curtis Morris from the
University of California, San Francisco, who agreed with the recommendation. The
subcommittee plans a PICO (P = Population, I = Intervention, C = Comparators, O = Outcome)
search, focusing on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease as outcomes. He opened the floor
for questions on potassium.
Chair Van Horn commented that Americans have a very high intake of sodium and inadequate
intake of potassium. Dr. Appel said a high sodium level and low potassium level usually go
together. Chair Van Horn said it would take massive dietary changes for most Americans to get
enough potassium. Dr. Slavin asked where all the sodium is coming from. Dr. Appel said
sodium comes from many food groups, but much of it comes from bread as salt or sodium
bicarbonate. Processed food is a large source. Sources of sodium is an area in need of research.
Dr. Appel turned to the third research question, the effects of sodium chloride on health. The
subcommittee concluded that sodium chloride intake and blood pressure are directly linked.
Daily intake of less than 2,300 mg is recommended. Many people will benefit from a further
reductions in intake, to 1,500 mg, including hypertensive individuals, blacks, and middle-aged
and older adults. Individuals should concurrently increase potassium consumption. The
subcommittee has had two conference calls on sodium. IOM has a study on sodium reduction
strategies. Within the broad question of sodiumâ€™s effect on health are sub-questions of the
effects of sodium intake on blood pressure in children; the effects of sodium on cardiovascular
disease, stroke, coronary heart disease, left ventricular mass, heart failure, kidney disease, end-
stage renal disease, proteinuria, bone mineral density, osteoporosis, gastric cancer, esophageal
cancer, and stomach cancer; and the health effects of the sodium/potassium ratio. He opened the
floor to questions.
Dr. Pearson suggested that IOM could serve as an implementation partner with regards to
sodium intake reduction and the Guidelines.
Dr. Pi-Sunyer said the second sub-question, on the effect of sodium on the different conditions,
should be worded to make clear that the effect of sodium is on the development of conditions,
not the treatment of them. Dr. Appel said he was not looking at treatment, though many
interventions involve reduced sodium.
Dr. Christine Williams spoke on the effect of sodium on blood pressure in children. There is an
expanding body of literature linking sodium intake to blood pressure in youths. In US and many
other industrialized nations, blood pressure rises by 1.9 mm of mercury per year for boys, 1.5
mm for girls. However, among South African Natives who do not use salt, blood pressure does
not increase throughout life. The NHANES data shows there has been an increase in mean
systolic (of 1.4 mm of mercury) and diastolic blood pressure (3.3 mm of mercury) in boys and
