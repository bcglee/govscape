Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 35
Dr. Achterberg suggested including guidance on food storage and spoilage during a power
outage.
Dr. Appel said there was initially a recommendation for two servings of fish per week that was
removed. If the recommendation is to be put back in, it will be important to know why it was
taken out. Ms. McMurry said the recommendation is in the Guidelines. However, the evidence
was strongest for secondary prevention. Therefore, it was not a key recommendation for the
general public, but rather a statement for individuals who have already experienced a
cardiovascular event. Dr. Rimm said the issue of fish affects chronic disease and will have to be
handled carefully to correctly inform the consumers without frightening them. Dr. Perez-
Escamilla said the American Heart Association also has recommendations on fish and that no
one is recommending that pregnant women not eat fish. It is important to do consumer-based
research or find data to understand the best way to present the information and prevent
misunderstanding. Chair Van Horn said the recommendations should be responsible, noting that
there had been other problems with fish farming and recommended bringing in outside experts.
Dr. Clemens said he knows people in aquaculture who can be brought in. Dr. Slavin noted that
eating more fish will mean eating less of something else and that the balance must be
maintained. Chair Van Horn said all of the discussions had been excellent and that many
important questions were being raised.
Scientific Review Committee
Due to the lack of time, Chair Van Horn addressed the Scientific Review subcommittee’s role
going forward in the meeting wrap-up. The Scientific Review subcommittee’s role will be to
help the seven topic area subcommittees deal with cross-cutting issues and prioritize their
research questions.
Meeting Wrap-Up
Chair Van Horn said the Committee has overarching issues to take up and that the
subcommittees have received feedback to work into their discussions. The questions and issues
should be prioritized, with the understanding that there is a finite amount of time. The most
important issues should be chosen. The NEL searches have begun, so the Committee can start
with discussions leading to the development of preliminary conclusion statements at the next
meeting, on the 29th and 30th of April. The subcommittees should determine what issues require
outside expertise and either speak with the expert via conference call or, for cross-cutting issues,
consider whether the entire Committee would benefit from hearing the expert, remembering that
time and resources are limited. The subcommittees should consider the top three cross-cutting
topics and what expert would address them in ways that are not already published. The
subcommittees will also deliver progress reports at that meeting.
Dr. Rimm said Dr. Nelson’s question on food environment touched every subcommittee and
suggested Mary Story as a presenter. Dr. Pearson said webinars can be a useful tool, especially
for experts who are hard to schedule. The web archive will be available to other members and
