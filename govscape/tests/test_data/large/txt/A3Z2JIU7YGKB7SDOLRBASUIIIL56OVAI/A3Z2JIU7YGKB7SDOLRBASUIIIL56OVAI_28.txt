Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 29
supporting data. There may be some evidence worth pursuing on age group-specific benefits and
risks, which will require new questions. More work will be needed on the risks and benefits in
the younger population. There may be a lower risk of diabetes, and the subcommittee will look
into the risks associated with injury and binge drinking. There is documentation on the
associations with coronary heart disease, cancer, and possibly other diseases in older
populations, as well as the risk of injury.
The second question was, “What is the relationship between consuming four or fewer drinks and
macronutrient/micronutrient profile and overall diet quality?” This is a cross-cutting issue. The
guidance was that that this level of drinking is not associated with diet quality, and the guidance
is not likely to change. Dr. Slavin pointed out that four drinks is a large calorie intake. Dr.
Rimm agreed that the calories are an issue, especially in older populations with reduced caloric
needs. There is a need for further work on this question, especially toward defining high-risk
subgroups: overweight and obese, hypertension, diabetes, and the inability to metabolize ethanol.
There is also data on suppression of folate and other nutrients. This was not covered in the
earlier Guidelines, so the literature search should go back further.
The third question was, “What is the relationship between consuming four or fewer drinks and
obesity?” A conclusive statement was not able to be drawn from the data in 2005. The data
from observational studies may be flawed, since people cut out alcohol to lose weight. The
subcommittee will look at prospective studies looking at alcohol and body weight. At one or two
drinks per day, the prospective studies published prior to the last DGAC report did not suggest
an association. He asked for discussion on this.
Chair Van Horn noted that alcohol impacts discretionary calories. Dr. Pearson said if alcohol
affects coronary disease and HDL metabolism, it might be a nutrient. However, Chair Van Horn
made clear that the Committee is not advocating that people start drinking. Dr. Rimm said
moderate consumption can lower the glycemic index of a meal. At higher levels, people lose
their inhibitions and overeat. Chair Van Horn pointed out that alcohol consumption is probably
underreported. Dr. Rimm agreed but noted that 10 percent of people reported overconsumption,
according to Dr. Krebs-Smith’s earlier presentation. Dr. Perez-Escamilla said there may be a
relationship between alcohol consumption and dietary nutrient intake, modified by context and
the type of drink. Dr. Pearson said it is important to emphasize that above four drinks, it is a
drug issue and that the study of alcohol has confounding factors. Dr. Fukagawa asked about
beverage type. Dr. Rimm said, for chronic disease, the benefits are the same regardless of
beverage type, but the subcommittee will review the literature regarding the beverage type.
Dr. Rimm moved on to the research addressing drinking patterns. The 2005 Guidelines
addressed binge drinking. However, the subcommittee wants to look at age of initiation and the
effects on young adults. There is data on light drinkers who become moderate drinkers and get a
benefit, but it is difficult to see how to make that a guideline. The subcommittee is looking at
successful interventions for those who drink too much, and that might become a new research
question. The 2005 Guidelines addressed health issues related to heart disease, stroke, and
cancers. The subcommittee wishes to include other chronic diseases within the moderate
drinking range, including diabetes and gallstones. There are also people who should not drink at
all. In the 2005 Guidelines, this group includes those who cannot control consumption, pregnant
