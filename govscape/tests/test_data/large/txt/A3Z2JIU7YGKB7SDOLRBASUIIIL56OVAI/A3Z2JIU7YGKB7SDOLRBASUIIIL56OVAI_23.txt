Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 24
Dr. Nelson commented that the subcommittee looks at a lot of nutrients, so there is a lot of work
to do. She suggested triaging the questions and limiting some literature searches to updates.
Some of the questions will not need research, just application of the knowledge we have.
Dr. Pi-Sunyer expressed support for the subcommittee’s looking at the implementation of the
Guidelines. Chair Van Horn suggested focusing on nutrients for which inadequate intakes are
already established, such as calcium, potassium, folate, and fiber. Dr. Achterberg suggested
waiting for all the subcommittee presentations to see if aligning the subcommittees in other
ways would more effectively address the questions. Dr. Nelson agreed that dietary patterns,
flexibility, behavior, and the environment are cross-cutting issues.
Dr. Rimm said the Committee should think of the downstream effects of the Guidelines, such as
their effect on food stamps. Dr. Perez-Escamilla said the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program is looking at incentives for healthier choices, and the Nutrient Adequacy subcommittee
might want to look at that and other government initiatives. Dr. Appel noted that some shortfall
nutrients don’t seem to have a clinical or public health consequence, which may require a new
way of looking at the questions. Dr. Fukagawa said the question might be to look at whether or
not there are clinical nutritional issues that the Committee is aware of, then to look at how to
address it. Dr. Slavin said that there are accepted nutrient standards and the Committee’s
recommendations need to find food patterns that deliver these nutrients.
Energy Balance and Weight Management Subcommittee
Discussion Leader: Xavier Pi-Sunyer
Dr. Pi-Sunyer began by reviewing the questions considered in 2005. There were five energy
balance questions in the 2005 report, two about physical activity, one about proportions of fat
and carbohydrates to maintain BMI or achieve long-term weight loss, one on the relationship
between energy-dense food and BMI, and one on the relationship between portion size and
energy intake. To these, the subcommittee added new research questions: what behaviors related
to food intake most contribute to maintaining a healthy weight; what behaviors related to food
intake most contribute to unhealthy body weight; what environmental factors contribute to an
unhealthy body weight; and what is the role of dietary intake in the maintenance of energy
balance and prevention of obesity in childhood? On the question of the proportion of fat and
carbohydrates to maintain BMI or achieve long term weight loss, the subcommittee added
protein to the question. The literature review from 2005 was extensive, so it will be updated.
Dr. Perez-Escamilla reported on the question on the relationship between the consumption of
energy-dense foods and BMI. The 2005 subcommittee concluded that eating foods of low
energy density may be a helpful strategy to reduce energy intake when trying to maintain or lose
weight, but data to determine the contribution of energy-dense foods to unhealthy weight gain
were insufficient. The subcommittee will focus on a few additional sub-questions: the extent to
which dietary energy density is associated with BMI and whether this area of inquiry can be
extended to type 2 diabetes and other chronic disease. He proposed an NEL search for studies
since 2004 on the link between dietary energy density and the outcomes of interest. The review
will cover adults and children. Energy density will be measured by kilocalories per gram of
