Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 25
food. There will be stratification by age, gender, and BMI. Dr. Nickols-Richardson noted that
the question might overlap with the dietary patterns question from the Nutrient Adequacy
subcommittee.
Dr. Nelson presented on the questions relating to physical activity. There were two physical
activity questions in the 2005 report, one on how physical activity is related to body weight and
other nutrition-related aspects of health and one on how much physical activity a weight-reduced
person needs to avoid weight regain. These questions were addressed by the Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee Report, 2008. The adult recommendation was
150 minutes per week of moderate activity, 75 minutes of vigorous activity, or a combination of
the two; 60 minutes per day for children. For weight maintenance, the recommendation was to
balance energy intake with physical activity. For weight loss, the recommendation was more
activity, ideally combined with energy intake reduction. To maintain weight after weight loss,
60 minutes of moderate or 30 minutes of vigorous activity daily was recommended. Dr. Nelson
noted that limiting intake appears to be key for successful long-term weight control.
Dr. Nelson addressed the questions on behaviors that contribute to maintaining healthy weight or
to unhealthy body weight. There is work on self-monitoring, television viewing, maternal
feeding practices, breakfast consumption, snacking, meal frequency, family meals, food eaten
away from home, late night eating, container sizes, portion sizes, and food purchasing patterns.
After the initial searches on these topics, this issue should be narrowed to the behaviors most
related to intake.
Dr. Achterberg suggested separating behaviors predictive of food intake from behaviors that
influence food intake. Dr. Appel wondered what the outcome variable would be. Dr. Pi-Sunyer
said weight is an easier outcome variable than calorie intake. Chair Van Horn also noted that the
heaviest people underreport calories. She noted the importance of self-monitoring and suggested
it as a possible recommendation. Dr. Perez-Escamilla said television viewing is important, since
unhealthy foods are heavily advertized.
Dr. Nelson discussed the question of what environmental factors contribute to an unhealthy body
weight. While there is a lot of research on environment and food choices, few studies are
controlled trials, and it may be difficult to develop a recommendation. Dr. Perez-Escamilla
noted that much of this work, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), is being done by
non-nutritionists. Dr. Rimm suggested bringing in outside experts, such as Mary Story or Chris
Economos.
Dr. Williams spoke on childhood obesity. The American Dietetic Association Evidence
Analysis Library (ADA EAL) has examined factors associated with childhood overweight. The
subcommittee will review the work done by the ADA EAL and update and expand their
searches. To the questions on behavior, she added a sub-question on what dietary behaviors are
associated with maintenance of healthy weight and prevention of obesity in children. Some
behaviors ADA has investigated include eating away from home, portion size, eating frequency,
and skipping breakfast. These behaviors will be looked at in children and adults, extending the
searches ADA did.
