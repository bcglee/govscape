Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 31
Dr. Pi-Sunyer suggested rewriting the question to indicate that the goal is less than 100
milligrams per deciliter, not 100 and over. Dr. Pearson said he would resubmit the question.
The next research question addressed whether the 2010 Dietary Guidelines should add HDL-
cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels as metabolic endpoints. These lipids are associated with
cardiovascular disease. Triglycerides are directly associated and HDL cholesterol is inversely
associated. The Adult Treatment Panel has no target levels for HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.
There is a literature on the relationship of these to other dietary fats, and the subcommittee will
look at the relationship to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Dr. Appel said HDL levels have a
strange relationship with other fats and that FDA does not allow it to be used as a surrogate
marker. Dr. Pearson said the issue was that raising HDL is beneficial to health. Dr. Appel said
making decisions based on HDL has not been done in the Guidelines before. Dr. Pearson said
the Adult Treatment Panel is doing work on this, and the subcommittee will be watching that
work. Dr. Perez-Escamilla asked if inflammation markers and c-reactive protein should be
metabolic endpoints. Dr. Pearson said they are too distal. He gave the floor to Dr. Rimm.
Dr. Rimm said n-3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease are being covered in the discussions on
fish, but there is evidence of n-3 fatty acids having an effect on other health outcomes, including
age-related macular degeneration, cognitive function, mental health, hypertension, and prostate
cancer. There is also new data on the importance of n-3 fatty acids in brain development. With
the better evidence of n-3 fatty acid being good for the child, there is more to focus on the
benefits of fish than on toxicology. It will be a challenge to work this into PICO subcategories.
Research question 8 addressed n-3 fatty acids, and there have been many meta-analyses on the
topic that help.
Dr. Rimm addressed the question of the impact of the n-6 to n-3 ratio on predicting health
outcomes. Epidemiologic data suggests reduced cardiovascular disease and a better lipid
inflammation profile for people with higher n-3 than n-6 intakes. However, some people fear
that higher intake of n-6 fatty acids relates to DHA absorption in the brain and increases cancer.
A high n-6 in the ratio has shown adverse outcomes in animal models. He wants to invite good
speakers who can present the argument from both sides. Dr. Appel said n-6 and n-3 should be
viewed separately, not in terms of a ratio. A recommendation on the ratio would be hard to
implement, so the question is, what are the benefits of increasing or decreasing n-6? Dr. Slavin
said it would be good for the speaker also to have expertise in childhood nutrition.
Dr. Pearson addressed the research question on individual foods that have a fat basis for some
of their potential health effects: meat, nuts, fish, eggs, and chocolate. Some reduce CVD, while
others increase it. The role of nuts and fish are particularly interesting. At least one speaker will
be invited on the health effects of nut consumption. Dr. Slavin asked about stearic acid in
chocolate and meat. Dr. Pearson said stearic acid is linked to concerns about thrombosis. Dr.
Slavin asked if it is better to have a category looking at the foods themselves rather than the
nutrients or components. Dr. Perez-Escamilla said it is important for the subcommittee to come
up with reasonable criteria as to which foods get listed. Dr. Pearson said the list is potentially
endless. Dr. Rimm said chocolate can be taken off the list and meat, beans, and milk added. Dr.
Pearson said the questions should look at the types of fats with lipid, cardiovascular, and
metabolic endpoints. The questions will look at the average daily intake of nuts, fish, eggs, and
