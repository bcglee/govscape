Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 4
behavioral changes to improve compliance, and the health-effects of different protein sources,
nutritional supplements, specific functional foods or food components. ASN also endorsed the
Physical Activity Guidelines and suggested a set of guidelines encompassing dietary and
physical activity recommendations, since separating nutrition from physical activity may confuse
the public and diffuse the message.
Christina Pirello, the host of Christina Cooks on National Public Television, said the
healthcare crisis is directly related to peopleâ€™s diets, so changing eating habits can solve the
problem. However, advertising creates a market for unhealthy food and misinforms consumers.
She said the Guidelines should encourage consumption of vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole
unprocessed grains and discourage consumption of saturated fats, sugar, and junk food. She said
the Guidelines should provide more information on the benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets,
that consumption of plant foods is linked to longevity, and that plant foods are more
environmentally-friendly.
Stephen Abelman from the March of Dimes said his organization promotes healthy nutrition
for women of child-bearing age in order to improve the health of babies. According to a recent
survey, less than 40 percent of women of childbearing age take a daily multivitamin containing
folic acid, which would reduce the incidence of neural tube birth defects. Other studies show
that most women do not achieve the recommended 400 micrograms of folic acid from naturally
folate-rich foods. This raises the importance of enriched grain products. He encouraged the
Committee to maintain a balance between whole and enriched grains in the 2010 Guidelines in
order to reduce birth defects.
Rosa Gonzalez, a citizen from Virginia, told of her experience. After being diagnosed with
metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and high blood pressure, under the supervision of a dietician,
started a vegetarian diet. She weighed 225 pounds at the time. Since becoming a vegetarian, she
has lost nearly 100 pounds. Her blood pressure and her cholesterol level have gone down. Her
diabetes is in remission. She said the Guidelines should support alternatives, such as a
vegetarian diet.
Pamela Popper, PhD, ND, Director of the Wellness Forum, said her forum helps people
reverse degenerative disease by making diet and lifestyle changes. Her organization reverses
degenerative conditions by putting the patient on a near vegetarian or vegan diet. She said there
is evidence for a plant-based diet as a means of preventing and treating disease. However, the
Guidelines are not consistent with such a diet, since they give too much allowance for animal
foods, dairy products, fats, oils, and refined foods. She said the best diet for humans is a near
vegetarian or vegan, and the Guidelines should support such a diet.
Mary Van Elswyk, from the Martek Biosciences Corporation, urged the Committee to
consider the availability, sustainability, and quality of food sources, especially sources of long-
chain omega-3 fatty acids. The current Guidelines suggest two fish meals per week to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease. Additional data suggest that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation of
over 500 mg per day may significantly reduce blood pressure and heart rate, and there is
evidence of DHA omega-3 improving neurocognitive health and development. She said the
2005 report overlooked the importance of DHA omega-3 among pregnant and nursing women,
