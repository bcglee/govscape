Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 2
Meeting minutes will be posted on www.dietaryguidelines.gov. He gave the floor to Dr. Van
Horn.
Dr. Van Horn, Chair of DGAC, said that, since the first meeting, the Committee has begun
identifying the issues that warrant a literature review and has established subcommittees. The
Fluid and Electrolytes subcommittee has been renamed the Sodium, Potassium, and Water
subcommittee; it is chaired by Dr. Appel. Dr. Nickols-Richardson chairs the Nutrient Adequacy
subcommittee. Dr. Pi-Sunyer chairs the Energy Balance and Weight Management
subcommittee. Dr. Slavin chairs the Carbohydrates and Protein subcommittee, formerly called
the Carbohydrates subcommittee. Dr. Rimm chairs the Ethanol subcommittee. Dr. Pearson
chairs the Fatty Acids subcommittee. Dr. Clemens chairs the Food Safety and Technology
subcommittee. Dr. Van Horn Chairs the Science Review subcommittee. The subcommittees’
goals are to begin formulating scientific review questions, identifying high-priority questions,
and proposing where outside experts will be needed to fill major information needs. The
subcommittees have identified cross-cutting areas that require additional discussion, including
macronutrient distribution, liquid versus solid added sugars, alcohol intake, probiotics and
prebiotics, fish consumption, dietary patterns, and satiety. The Science Review subcommittee
has been working to clarify the scientific approach. She reviewed the agenda and introduced the
public oral testimony portion of the meeting.
Public Oral Testimony
Guy Johnson, PhD, Executive Director of The McCormick Science Institute, presented on
the benefits of herbs and spices, both to health and to the flavor of food. Studies suggest that
several spices and herbs have a powerful antioxidant effect, some have an anti-inflammatory
effect, and some contribute to satiety and increased basal metabolic rate. Herbs and spices can
be used to help reduce sodium intake and to add to the healthfulness of the diet without adding
calories. He noted that herbs and spices can also have a role in food safety by impeding the
formation of heterocyclic amines during grilling. He encouraged the Committee to keep spices
in mind when discussing Dietary Guidelines.
Ann Marie Krautheim, MA, RD, LD, Senior Vice President of Nutrition Affairs at the
National Dairy Council, raised three key points: the importance of the Dietary Guidelines,
dairy’s unique nutrient package, and the validity of the recommended three to four daily servings
of dairy. Americans consume an increasing amount of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods, and the
Dietary Recommendations can reverse the trend. Dairy foods provide essential nutrients, such as
calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, zinc, protein, riboflavin, and vitamins A, B12,
and D. Dairy foods are nutrient-dense and available in forms safe for people with lactose
intolerance. The potassium in milk blunts the effect of sodium on blood pressure. Health
authorities recommend three to four servings of dairy daily for better nutrient uptake, better diet
quality, and improved bone health and reduced risk of chronic disease.
Ceci Snyder, MS, RD, Assistant Vice President for Consumer Marketing at the National
Pork Board, said Americans are eating too many calories and too few nutrients. Less than half
of Americans consume the recommended 5.5 ounces of meat or meat equivalent and that 75
percent of school-age children are not reaching the MyPyramid recommendation for the meat
