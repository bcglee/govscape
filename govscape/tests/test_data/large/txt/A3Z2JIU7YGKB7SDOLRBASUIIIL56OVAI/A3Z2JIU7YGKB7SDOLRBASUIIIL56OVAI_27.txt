Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 28
useful. Dr. Achterberg said potatoes are another issue to address, since it confounds the
glycemic index discussion around fruits and vegetables.
Chair Van Horn observed that adding fiber supplements to a diet does not have the same
benefits, regarding weight loss and glycemic load, as eating foods that are high in fiber.
Consumers are confused on this issue, so the guidance should be updated to emphasize high-
fiber foods. Dr. Appel noted that fiber supplements do not show the blood pressure benefits that
high-fiber foods do. Dr. Slavin pointed out that many healthy foods, such as root vegetables, are
high glycemic, and that may confuse consumers. Dr. Perez asked if the issue of soluble versus
insoluble fiber will be addressed. Dr. Slavin said they will only address dietary fiber.
Dr. Slavin said that another area of interest is satiety, which the Fatty Acid subcommittee is
looking at. She would like to see a speaker on that subject as it relates to carbohydrates. Dr.
Clemens said several experts are looking at complex/simple carbohydrates, fortification, and
satiety, whom he could contact. Dr. Achterberg added that there are three fiber issues: satiety,
laxation, and gut health. Dr. Clemens said there is a good deal of recent literature on laxation.
Dr. Slavin said that looking at glycemic index for controlling glucose does work, but not in
addressing type I diabetes, since it is outside of the scope of practice.
Dr. Perez-Escamilla asked if the subcommittee would look at consumer knowledge and attitudes
toward carbohydrates and the relationship of carbohydrate on health. Dr. Slavin noted that
people think carbohydrates are bad and fiber is good. Chair Van Horn agreed that it is an issue
arising from confusion about sugar, though there may be little literature on the issue. Consumers
can be educated on reading food labels. Dr. Achterberg said there is literature on knowledge and
attitudes on carbohydrates, but the issue might be handled more generally in the Guidelines. Dr.
Nelson said the Committee should look into what sort of communications actually create
behavior change.
Dr. Appel raised three issues. First, there is no question on the health effects of meat. Second, it
is not clear what effect replacing enriched grains with whole grains has on folate intake. Third,
consider whether there should be a separate subcommittee on food groups. Chair Van Horn said
the food group topic can be addressed in the subcommittees with an affinity to the subject, like
Nutrient Adequacy. Meat can be handled in the Fatty Acid discussions. The Scientific Review
subcommittee could tie up the food groups area if need be. Dr. Nelson said it is important to
triage and focus on shortfall nutrients that could have profound health implications. Choline will
be looked at by the Nutrient Adequacy subcommittee
Ethanol Subcommittee
Discussion Leader: Eric Rimm
Dr. Rimm presented from the Ethanol subcommittee, starting with the 2005 Guidelines. In
2005, the first question was, “Among persons who consume four or fewer drinks per day, what is
the dose response between alcohol and health?” The guidance was that one to two drinks a day
lowers total mortality, lowers coronary heart disease, and slightly increases breast cancer risk.
Risks and benefits do not differ between middle-aged and elderly. There is little or no benefit for
younger people. It is unlikely that the guidance will change, except that there may be more
