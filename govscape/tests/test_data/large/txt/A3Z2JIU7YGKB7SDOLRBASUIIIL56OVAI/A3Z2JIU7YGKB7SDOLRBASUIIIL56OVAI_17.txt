Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 18
Updates to MyPyramid Food Intake Patterns
Patricia Britten, PhD, Technical Project Leader for MyPyramid with the Center for
Nutrition Policy and Promotion of USDA, gave background on the Pyramid and how it was
constructed, as well as ongoing research and work going into MyPyramid. In 1992, the original
Pyramid first focused on total diet, rather than just ensuring that people get adequate nutrients.
MyPyramid was built on that model. The guiding principles for the Pyramid are that it target
overall health, use up-to-date research, focus on the total diet, and that it be flexible, practical,
realistic, useful, and evolutionary. Commonly consumed foods are used, with multiple options
for each food group. The food groups should be the same for every member of the family, and
the Pyramid should be updatable over time. The food intake patterns are designed to meet DRI
and Dietary Guidelines recommendations, based on twelve patterns that are designed to meet the
energy needs of different population groups.
Intake patterns are determined by nutrient goals and calorie needs. The estimated energy
requirement (EER) was determined for a reference-sized individual at a particular age, sex, and
activity level. Many population groups overlapped, so they were categorized into twelve levels
of calorie requirements and nutrient needs. MyPyramid adhered closely to the original food
groups, and nutrient profiles were determined for each food group. The nutrient profile is a
measure of what nutrients could be expected from a certain amount of food from a given food
group, based on a weighted average of commonly-consumed items. These profiles were used in
determining the recommended amounts from each food group. Once an intake pattern had been
formed that met nutrient standards, the remaining calories were considered discretionary.
Dr. Britten gave some preliminary results on ongoing efforts. Nutrient profiles are being updated
for all food groups. Intake patterns with these updated nutrient profiles will be available in the
spring. A nutrient profile is being made for the milk group, which previously did not have one.
Skim milk had been used as the representative food for the group. Item clusters are being
identified, and work is being done on calculating a consumption-weighted nutrient profile. Some
revised subgroups are being considered for the vegetable group in order to better meet nutrient
needs. Another project is to identify tiers for foods within food groups based on their nutrient-
density, as measured by the amount of SoFAAS (solid fats, added sugars, and alcohol) in the
food. Then amounts and proportions can be recommended that provide guidance for choices
within a food group. Tier one foods will be those lowest in SoFAAS.
Discussion
Dr. Perez-Escamilla asked about feedback ideas for the tier information. Dr. Britten said she is
looking for consumer feedback on the materials and will do focus group testing. Additionally,
she will look at how well the messages are understood. The tools will be interactive. Dr. Perez-
Escamilla suggested including the tiers in food labels.
