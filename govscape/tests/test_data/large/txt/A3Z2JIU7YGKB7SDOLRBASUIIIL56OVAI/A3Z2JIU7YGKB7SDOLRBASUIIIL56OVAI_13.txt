Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 14
are used to statistically model an estimated usual intake. In response to a request from the Co-
Executive Secretaries, she included choline and cholesterol in her data, as well as the nutrients in
the report. Those data came from the two later surveys.
Very few people had intakes below their Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) for
carbohydrates, selenium, niacin, and riboflavin. Across the population, only five percent had
phosphorus intake below the EAR, but nearly half of adolescent females did. Most individuals
had vitamin E intakes below the EAR, and a third to half of the population was below the EAR
for vitamin C, vitamin A, and magnesium. Below-EAR levels of intake were most common in
teens and the elderly for magnesium, and in teens and adults for vitamins A and C.
Nearly a third of the population had intakes of calcium at the level of Adequate Intake (AI), and
females were less likely to meet the AI. Less than 5 percent of the population had potassium and
fiber intakes above the AI. Nearly all individuals exceeded the AI for sodium. About 10 percent
of individuals met the AI for choline, and females were less likely to meet the AI than males.
For cholesterol, 35 percent of individuals had intakes above 300 mg. She said there is more data
on the Food Surveys Research Group website.
Discussion
Dr. Pearson asked if there had been any changes in methodology among the studies, since he was
interested in looking at change over time. Ms. Moshfegh said the AMPM method was adopted
in 2002 and has been used since. She saw an increase in caloric intake over time.
Dr. Slavin asked about choline sources. Ms. Moshfegh said she hadn’t looked at dietary sources.
Dr. Rimm asked about the quality of the measure for assessing ethanol intake. Ms. Moshfegh
said she hadn’t looked at ethanol. Dr. Rimm suspected that people underreport ethanol, which
might account for some underreported energy.
Dr. Slavin asked about vitamin D. Ms. Moshfegh said vitamin D will be in the 2007-2008 data.
Dr. Appel asked about the precision of the measurements for different nutrients. Ms. Moshfegh
said the analysis has not been done, but accurately remembering everything they ate and drank is
difficult for the typical respondent. It is important to help the respondent remember all of their
foods and to estimate portion size. Nutrients can then be calculated from the USDA National
Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR).
Dr. Nickols-Richardson asked about individuals not meeting the EAR or AI to diet size, since the
nutrients were linked to calories. Ms. Moshfegh said that could occur, and overweight people
tend to underreport calories.
Chair Van Horn noted that there are a number of Americans who are below the recommended
intakes of calcium, potassium, fiber, and choline but well above the recommended levels of
sodium and cholesterol.
