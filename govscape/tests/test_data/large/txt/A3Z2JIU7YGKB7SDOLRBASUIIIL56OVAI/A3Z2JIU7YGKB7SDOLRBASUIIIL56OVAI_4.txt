Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 5
women of childbearing age, children, and the elderly. Current expert group recommendations
include consumption of at least 200 mg DHA/d during pregnancy and nursing from low-risk
sources, such as low-methylmercury fish and dietary supplements from marine algal oil. Since
meeting that level can be difficult, the Committee should consider fortified foods and dietary
supplements in their recommendations.
Nina Gonzalez, a junior at Stafford High School in Fredericksburg, Virginia, has researched
vegetarian options in her school cafeteria. When she became a vegetarian, the cafeteria did not
have meatless options. She worked with the county nutrition director to get vegetarian options
on the menu. She encouraged the Committee to consider vegetarian options in the new
Guidelines.
Cheryl Leahy, General Counsel for Compassion Over Killing, said the Guidelines should
promote a vegan or plant-based diet, which offers the health benefits of reduced rates of heart
disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and obesity. She said public opinion is moving in favor of
plant-based diets. She added that animal agriculture is harmful to the environment, inefficient,
and cruel to animals. Though vegetarianism is increasing, current subsidy programs do not
reflect a priority on plant-based diets. She said the Guidelines should actively promote
vegetarian and vegan diets.
Jamie Zoellner, PhD, RD, spoke on behalf of the residents of the Lower Mississippi Delta
Region, a rural, impoverished region with extensive health and nutritional problems. She
researched health and nutrition literacy in the area two years after the 2005 Dietary Guidelines
and MyPyramid were released. Of those surveyed, 12 percent could identify the newest
mypyramid.gov. Participants did not trust the Internet as an information source, preferring
doctors and television. She encouraged the Committee to make disseminating culturally-
appropriate dietary guidance in hard-to-reach populations a priority. She warned that relying on
the Internet as a central mode of communication will widen the nutritional disparity gaps in the
region. .
Lorelei DiSogra, EdD, RD, Vice President for Nutrition and Health at the United Fresh
Produce Association, said her organization supports the fruit and vegetable recommendations
from the 2005 Guidelines. For the new Guidelines, she recommended clearer and stronger
recommendations to motivate people to eat more fruits and vegetables. She asked that the
recommendation on fruits and vegetables be easy to understand, like the Five-A-Day program or
a recommendation that half the plate be fruits and vegetables. She asked the Committee to
consider the policy implications of the recommendations.
Jennifer McGuire, MS, RD, of the National Fisheries Institute said Americans eat very little
seafood. The most popular information source about seafood is the media, but the media is often
inaccurate or misleading. The Guidelines should have clear, unequivocal recommendations on
fish. The recommendations should be based on science and scientifically-measured outcomes.
She recommended that the Committee adopt FDA’s holistic approach to the net effect of eating
fish, since elements and nutrients do not exist in a vacuum. She said eating fish is a dietary
change that can immediately benefit Americans’ health.
