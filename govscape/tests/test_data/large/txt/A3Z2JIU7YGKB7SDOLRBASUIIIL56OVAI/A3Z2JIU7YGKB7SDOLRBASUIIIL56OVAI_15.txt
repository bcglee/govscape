Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 16
Among all groups, consumption of whole grains through the 95th percentile was below the
minimum recommended amounts. Total grain intakes were compared to both the minimum and
maximum recommendations to identify potential excessive intakes. Among most sex/age
groups, intake of total grains is sufficient. However, when compared to the maximum
recommendations for an active lifestyle, intakes at the 90th and in some cases the 75th percentiles
are above the maximum recommendations.
For some foods, there are concerns about both insufficient and excessive intakes, especially for
vulnerable groups. One example is fish, with recommendations of 8 ounces of fish high in EPA
and DHA per week for those with a previous cardiac event, and not more than 12 ounces per
week of fish for women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young
children. Up through the 75th percentile, adult intakes are below 8 ounces per week, and at the
95th percentile of intake, none of the women or young children showed intakes greater than 12
ounces per week. These are intakes of all fish and seafood, not just fish that may be high in
mercury.
Meat and meat alternates, which are measured in ounce equivalents of lean meat, are also
compared to the minimum and maximum recommendations. For all age groups, intakes up
through the 25th percentiles are below recommendations, and for some groups up through the 50th
percentile or above are low. In contrast, about 25 percent of adult men and 10 percent of adult
women have intakes in excess of the maximum recommendations.
For milk, yogurt, and cheese, intakes are below minimum recommendations through the 25th
percentile for children, 50th for adolescent males, 75th of adult makes, and 90th percent for
females in most age categories.
Most sex/age groups are below the recommendations for intake of oils. Intakes of solid fats and
added sugars are compared to what can be considered upper level standards, and most are well
above these levels. The recommended maximum intake for alcoholic beverages was up to one
drink for women and two for men per day, and there was overconsumption at the high end of the
distribution.
For all sex/age groups, 75 percent of the population had intakes of energy from solid fats,
alcohol, and added sugars (SoFAAS) that exceeded the maximum recommendation for
discretionary calories. SoFAAS represent a large portion of discretionary calorie intake.
Total fat intake recommendations are between 20 and 35 percent of calories. No sex/age group
had total fat intake of less than 20 percent of all calories at the 5th percentile of intake. At the
75th percentile of intake and above, all groups had intakes of over 35 percent of their calories
from total fat. Among all groups, intakes of saturated fatty acids at the 50th percentile exceeded
the maximum recommendation.
Dr. Krebs-Smith concluded that a large swath of Americans have low intakes of fruit; vegetables,
especially non-starchy vegetables; whole grains; milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. They have
modest intakes of fish. They have sufficient, and in some cases excessive, intakes of total grains
