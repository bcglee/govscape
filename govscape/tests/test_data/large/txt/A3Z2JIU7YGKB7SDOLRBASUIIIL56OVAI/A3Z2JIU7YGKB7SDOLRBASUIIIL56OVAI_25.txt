Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 26
Dr. Williams said that the majority of children are of healthy weight and most adults are
overweight. The major challenge is to maintain healthy weight. For this question, the focus will
be on food and nutrient intake including total energy, dietary fat, dairy and calcium, fruits and
vegetables, and sweetened beverages. The subcommittee will look primarily at children between
2 and 19. Although ADA looked at total energy intake in children, they concluded that it may
not have a strong association with overweight in children. The review will be updated to see if
the conclusion holds. Dietary fat and sweetened beverage intake were associated with higher
adiposity. Fruit and vegetable intake were inversely related to adiposity, and low intake of dairy
and calcium intake may be associated with increased adiposity. The searches on the dietary
intake factors will be updated.
Dr. Fukagawa suggested looking into factors of overweight in the older population. Dr. Pi-
Sunyer said the question has not been dealt with by the subcommittee, but it should be discussed.
Chair Van Horn raised the factor of excessive gestational weight gain. Dr. Perez-Escamilla said
the subcommittee will use the IOM report, when it is released, to provide information about
gestational weight gain.
Dr. Slavin said the Carbohydrates and Protein subcommittee will be handling added sugars,
liquids versus solids, non-caloric sweeteners, and beverages.
Dr. Rimm stressed the importance of dietary guidelines for children and the effect on school
lunches. Dr. Pearson asked if there is evidence of the establishment of eating patterns in
childhood. Dr. Nelson said there is new tracking data. Dr. Appel suggested making a formal
question on whether or not patterns in nutrient intake and behaviors in children continue into
later life. Chair Van Horn suggested noting that the way to reduce obesity is to focus on
children. Dr. Nelson said there is data on cardiovascular risk factors in children, including
obesity. Dr. Perez-Escamilla said gestational weight gain, and infant feeding practices affect risk
of childhood obesity. Dr. Pearson said poor nutritional and physical activity habits in children
are attributable risk factors for adult obesity. Chair Van Horn thanked the members for the
discussion.
Carbohydrates and Protein Subcommittee
Discussion Leader: Joanne Slavin
Dr. Slavin reported from the Carbohydrate subcommittee, which has added protein to its charge.
She started with some questions from the 2005 report. The first question was on the relationship
between the intake of carbohydrates and dental caries. The subcommittee decided that
recommendation was unlikely to change, since there is little new data. The second question was
on the relationship between carbohydrate intake and incidence of diabetes mellitus. For this
question, the review for the 2005 report was extensive, and the update will build on it. The third
question looked at the utility of glycemic index/glycemic load for providing dietary guidance for
Americans. The Energy Balance subcommittee has also looked at this question. The
Carbohydrates and Protein subcommittee added two sub-questions: what is the utility of the
glycemic index for providing dietary guidance for Americans and what is the utility of the
glycemic load for providing dietary guidance for Americans? The fourth question asked the
