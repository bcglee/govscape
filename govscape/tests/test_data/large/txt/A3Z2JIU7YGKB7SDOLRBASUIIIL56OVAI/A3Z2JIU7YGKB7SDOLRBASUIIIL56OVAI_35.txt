Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 36
the public. Chair Van Horn agreed, saying that the time that the full Committee meets should be
used for Committee-wide cross-cutting issues.
Dr. Achterberg said there are still questions as to which subcommittee is handling which issue
and that some subcommittees have a very large scope. It would be helpful to have a list of
prioritized research questions from each subcommittee for the next Scientific Review
subcommittee meeting, on February 11, 2009. Dr. Appel noted that there have been
comprehensive reviews done by other bodies on many topics, so those reviews can be used.
Chair Van Horn said the Committee should embrace work that has already been done. Ms. Lyon
said existing systematic reviews from government entities can be used as a basis and merely
updated. Those from independent organizations would have to be reviewed and considered on a
case-by-case basis. She encouraged the subcommittees to pass on the studies to NEL staff. She
mentioned the Cochrane reviews as being relevant to the Committee, though some will require
review. ADA work can be built upon, updated, or modified to accommodate a slightly different
question.
Chair Van Horn asked about data specific to obesity related to the presentations. Dr. Post said he
would try to get the data through USDA and its partners.
Dr. Achterberg suggested having a speaker on consumer understanding of the Pyramid and the
use and utility of the Guidelines. Dr. Pearson said he knows of lectures on the subject that he
could make available.
Chair Van Horn thanked the Committee, staff, and public. She adjourned the meeting.
