Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 33
Dr. Clemens said the subcommittee is looking at emerging technologies and changes in
recommendations regarding food safety for the general consumer. He gave the floor to Dr.
Perez-Escamilla.
Dr. Perez-Escamilla spoke on methylmercury in fish. The Food Safety section of the 2005
report had three questions beyond the key FightBAC!® messages. One of those questions
related to fish exposed to methylmercury. The mercury is bioaccumulated as it moves up the
food chain, and it is found in the muscle tissue of seafood, especially long-lived predatory fish.
There are concerns about methylmercury exposure during pregnancy causing neurological
damage in the fetus’ brain. There are also concerns regarding cardiovascular injury. The 2005
Committee endorsed the federal and state advisory recommendations. The FDA and EPA
advisories recommended that women of childbearing age and young children to not eat shark,
swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish, because they contain high levels of mercury. The
advisory recommended up to 12 ounces per week of fish or shellfish with low mercury levels;
albacore or white tuna should be limited to up to 6 ounces per week due to a higher concentration
of methylmercury. Consumers were advised to follow local and state advisories. The Guidelines
did not include a key recommendation directly addressing fish consumption related to the risk of
methylmercury exposure.
FDA has recently released a draft risk/benefit analysis, and an IOM report, Seafood Choices, was
published in 2007. The IOM report is a comprehensive literature review on the risks and
benefits of fish consumption. It also has a section on how to implement the recommendations.
FDA’s report, Quantitative Risk and Benefit Assessment of Commercial Fish Consumption,
looked at neurological development, heart disease, and stroke. FDA also did a literature review,
so an NEL review may not be necessary. The recommended level of consumption may be higher
than the previous FDA and EPA recommendations.
The subcommittee is interested in data on methylmercury and fish consumption in pregnant
women, nursing or lactating women, two- to five-year old children, and, in general, those over
two years of age. Methylmercury has been found to affect cognitive function in adults. The
subcommittee is interested in extending the work to include persistent organic pollutants (POP),
and PCBs. However, there is little data on POPs. .
The question is, what are the risks for different levels and frequencies of fish consumption? The
subcommittee is also looking at whether the risks differ by type and source of fish. The FDA
risk analysis did not report by the type of fish. The source of the fish will also be a major issue.
The outcomes of interest are neurological toxicity in the fetus, newborn, or child; cardiovascular
disease; and other potential health outcomes. Cancer and neurological damage among adults
would also be included in the review.
Dr. Clemens said this issue overlaps with the Nutrient Adequacy and Fatty Acids
subcommittees’ work. The nutrients might be cardio-protective, and that interplays with the
potential toxicity. The subcommittee is not addressing PBAs, which is for EPA to address.
Dr. Clemens next discussed food allergies. Dr. Steven Taylor, an expert on food allergies, has
met with the subcommittee by conference call. Nearly four percent of the population has some
