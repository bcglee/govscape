Welcome and Opening Remarks
Dr. Robert Post, Acting Executive Director of the Center for Nutrition Policy and
Promotion (CNPP), USDA, welcomed participants to the second meeting of the 2010 Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC). He said that, though CNPP has the lead responsibility
for managing the process for establishing the Dietary Guidelines and the Committee’s activities,
the process is a joint effort, including the Agricultural Research Service and HHS’s Office of
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. The Committee’s work will result in an advisory
report to the Secretaries of USDA and HHS. The work of the 2010 DGAC remains consistent
with and committed to the Departments’ mutual interest in providing dietary guidance for
Americans to support health and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses. The Departments will
facilitate the Committee’s application of its work for federal nutrition policy.
The Committee is governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). Meetings are
announced in the Federal Register and are open to the public. The Committee receives written
comments online at www.dietaryguidelines.gov and will receive oral comments at this meeting.
