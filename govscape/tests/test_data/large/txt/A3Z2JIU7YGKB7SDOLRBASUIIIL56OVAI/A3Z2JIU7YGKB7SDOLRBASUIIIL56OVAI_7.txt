pathogens, and sodium. He said the national diet is shaped largely by politics, advertising, and
the processed food industries. This impact is seen in the School Lunch Program, which sets
lifelong eating habits. He said the 2010 Guidelines should reflect a spirit of change and should
be science-based, not influenced by tradition or politics. He said a vegan diet is the healthiest
diet and that the Guidelines should say so.
Bernice Deshay, a concerned citizen, shared her experience of a vegan diet improving health in
her family. Her mother was one of thirteen children. All of her mothers’ siblings died before 40
years of age due to cardiovascular problems, while her mother lived to be 93, having adopted a
vegan diet. Ms. Deshay expressed concern that the US is encouraging bad diets worldwide. She
urged the Committee to follow the science and recommend a vegetarian diet.
Richard Hanneman spoke for the Salt Institute. He said evidence-based medicine should not
start with a foregone conclusion; it should look at health outcomes. He said there were two
recent studies that suggest that normal sodium diets in comparison to low-sodium diets may
actually be detrimental in congestive heart failure patients. He said the 2110 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee should take a step back on sodium.
Michelle Matto, RD, of the International Dairy Foods Association said the Association
supported the 2005 recommendation of three servings of dairy per day and recommended that it
be carried over to the 2010 Guidelines. She pointed out that dairy products are nutritionally
dense and have benefits for the skeletal system as well as benefits for hypertension, weight
maintenance, insulin-resistance syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Dairy is a unique nutrient
package, and there are options for people who are lactose intolerant, including reduced-lactose
formulations and yogurt and cheese, which are naturally low in lactose. She recommended that
the Committee recommend at least three servings of dairy per day; encourage consumption of
nutrient-dense foods, including dairy products; encourage lactose-reduced dairy products as an
alternative for those avoiding lactose; and specifically allow for discretionary calories to increase
consumption of nutrient-dense foods like flavored milks and yogurt.
Betsy Faga, President of the North American Millers’ Association, noted that the 2005
Guidelines addressed the importance of both enriched and whole grain products and agreed with
the assessment. The milling industry has responded with new and improved whole grain
products. She encouraged the Committee to put out a message consistent with FDA and CDC’s
positions on folic acid in enriched flour.
Michael I. McBurney, PhD, from DSM Nutritional Products, Inc., asked the Committee to
include fortified foods and nutritional supplements in the Guidelines. With more than two-thirds
of Americans overweight and obese, the 2005 Guidelines recommended that people eat fewer
calories, be more active, and make wiser food choices. Supplements and fortified foods can aid
in that effort for people to eat less and reduce their energy intake while obtaining essential
nutrients.
Suzanne Havala Hobbs, RD, nutrition advisor for the Vegetarian Resource Group,
encouraged the Committee to emphasize a plant-based diet in the Guidelines. Studies show that
a vegetarian diet confers cardiovascular health benefits. Vegans have the lowest high blood
