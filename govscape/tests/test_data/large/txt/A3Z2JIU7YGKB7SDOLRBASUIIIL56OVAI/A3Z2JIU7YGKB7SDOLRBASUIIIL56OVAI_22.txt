Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 23
and food group intakes. This is another overarching theme, and behaviors have been
operationally defined as the issues that determine what and how much people actually eat, such
as portion size, meal frequency, and breakfast intake. Questions will focus on individual
behaviors, such as self-monitoring, eating competency, television viewing, skipping breakfast,
and snacking. These issues cross into the Energy Balance subcommittee area. Dr. Nelson said
that we need to make sure we coordinate between the subcommittees. Chair Van Horn said the
NEL team can address duplication of effort, since all the work is going to them.
Dr. Nickols-Richardson said that another 2005 question asked if special nutrient
recommendations are needed for certain groups. The subcommittee felt that some
recommendations may change, and there will be updated literature reviews. The questions will
focus on nutrient shortfalls. The subcommittee will look into whether or not the previous sub-
questions need to be addressed again. One sub-question addresses iron intake in women and
adolescent females, and it is likely that this recommendation won’t change. Another question is
folic acid, the health implications at different stages of the lifespan, and the effects of
fortification. Dr. Nelson said that for the folate question a search and sort framework is being
refined, to look at the health benefits and any potential negative health outcomes. Dr. Nickols-
Richardson said the subcommittee wants to look at vitamin D, acknowledging that the IOM is
also reviewing vitamin D and calcium. The subcommittee will slow down their work on D to
allow the IOM work to progress. They plan to use any public records related to the IOM work.
Chair Van Horn said people will want to know how to get Vitamin D, regardless of IOM’s
findings. Dr. Appel said if IOM does recommend a higher intake, it might not be possible to get
the new vitamin D level from diet alone. Dr. Nelson agreed that there is a precedent for the need
for micronutrient supplements.
A new research question for the subcommittee is what pattern of dietary protein intake is
associated with achieving recommended nutrient intakes? The subcommittee plans to review the
literature and conduct modeling with different protein sources—plant or animal based, as well as
percentage of total energy. Chair Van Horn noted that this cut across groups, especially
regarding plant protein sources.
Dr. Pi-Sunyer said the vitamin D issue cannot be ignored, if IOM’s report will come after the
DGAC’s. Dr. Nelson said the Committee will benefit from IOM’s work and will address the
issue later in the year. Dr. Appel said IOM may come up with an increased recommendation for
vitamin D, and the Committee’s role is to show how to achieve that level. Dr. Nelson agreed
that a lot of the work can be done without a specific number in mind.
Dr. Nickols-Richardson said the last two questions were on nutrient composition of foods and
bioavailability. The first question asked if the nutrient composition of foods has significantly
changed since 2005 in a manner that impacts that nutrient adequacy. The second question asked
if there is any evidence that nutrient bioavailability has significantly changed due to alterations in
the nutrient matrix of foods. This question includes issues of food fortification and functional
foods. The subcommittee will use ARS information to help examine these questions.
