Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 21
girls between 1989 and 2000. This increase is higher in minorities. Another study shows an
increase in the proportion of children and adolescents with hypertension or pre-hypertension
between 1988 and 1999. The increase in obesity in youth may exacerbate the problem, since
obesity and sodium are both linked to high blood pressure. Many observational studies have
evaluated the link between sodium and high blood pressure in youth. A meta-analysis of the
literature showed that for a 42 percent reduction in sodium intake, the reduction was 1.17 mm of
mercury systolic, 1.29 mm mercury diastolic. Sodium intake in US children is very high, most
exceeding the upper limit; and potassium intake is very low, most not meeting the AI. The
Dietary Guidelines should emphasize increasing potassium intake in children and adolescents
through increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The next step is a formal
literature search on the question of health effects of sodium on blood pressure in children. The
timeline will probably be from the 1980s to the present.
Dr. Nelson noted that food supply was different in the 1980s, as were obesity rates. Dr.
Williams said the intervention trials from that period will still apply, though observational
studies may not.
Dr. Appel said there might be some updates and revisions for water and potassium, but the
general approach should be crafted by the next meeting. Sodium will take more work, since
literature searches are needed on many topics.
Dr. Pearson asked about left ventricular mass and aortic stiffness in adolescents. Dr. Williams
said there are studies looking at cardiovascular risk factors and precursors of heart disease, and
they are related to high blood pressure. She said she would look into those studies. Dr. Pi-
Sunyer suggested looking into the interaction between sodium intake and weight gain. Dr.
Williams said she would be looking at studies on that interaction. Dr. Pi-Sunyer asked about the
elderly as a subgroup. Dr. Appel said the elderly benefit immediately from sodium reduction.
Dr. Pearson asked if the IOM study looked at sodium reduction strategies in children. Dr. Appel
said the IOM is studying sodium reduction at all stages.
Dr. Fukagawa asked about a recent study on sodium intake and congestive heart failure. Dr.
Appel said there was a European trial for severe congestive heart failure. In those patients,
sodium reduction was harmful, due to heavy medication and treatments very different from the
US standard of care. However, long-term hypertension prevention trial showed that heart
disease increased as the sodium/potassium ratio increased.
Chair Van Horn suggested increasing potassium levels in the School Lunch Program.
Dr. Nelson asked about very active adolescents and electrolytes. Dr. Appel said the body has
compensatory measures to keep people from losing sodium. People who are routinely active on
a low-sodium diet will acclimate.
Dr. Van Horn thanked the Committee for their participation and adjourned for the day.
