Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 32
chocolate in relation to reduced risk of heart or cardiovascular disease. Then a more specific
question is, does the type of nut or fatty acid composition affect the inverse association?
Dr. Pearson said question 14, which looked at a number of special diets that were thought to
have had a lipid and fatty acid basis for their effects, could be moved to the Nutrient Adequacy
or Energy Balance subcommittees.
Dr. Clemens spoke on satiety. The question is, what are the circulating factors that signal
satiety? What are the time components associated with the signaling, and what do humans do to
modulate or to respond to these various signals that have been delineated? There are GI satiety
signals, and there are components in the diet that suppress or stimulate the vagus nerves,
suppressing appetite. Another model looked at the role of fat in satiety. The fat model looks at
oleic acid 18:1. It is hypothetical at this point, but there may be data for future guidelines. The
subcommittee would like to look at the role of fatty acids in satiety and their influence on how
quickly people eat. There may be a combination of foods that influences satiety. The
subcommittee would also like to know what the physiological signals of satiety are and whether
listening to them will modulate lifestyle and choice of foods. It is possible that there is a
combination or ratio of fatty acids that contributes to satiety.
Because health benefits have been linked to a number of fatty acids, the subcommittee is looking
at the entire bioburden and conversion efficiencies to identify the appropriate effect. Do these
fatty acids actually contribute benefits, or are there associated risks with consumption or
overconsumption? If so, the subcommittee must look for dietary behaviors that influence the
consumption of these fatty acids.
Dr. Pearson said there are too many questions before the subcommittee and they will have to be
narrowed down. He opened the floor for discussion. Dr. Slavin raised the issue of satiety with
carbohydrates and proteins. There is a lot of new data, and a complete macronutrient picture
would be important.
Dr. Pearson said there is epidemiologic data for the protective effects of fish consumption, but
data from randomized trials with omega 3 fatty acids have not been convincing. It is possible
that the fish effects come from other nutrients in the fish or are confounded with other dietary
habits related to fish-eating. Dr. Slavin said the issue overlaps with the Carbohydrates and
Protein subcommittee’s and the Nutrient Adequacy subcommittee’s work. She said different
meats have different nutrients and will behave differently. Dr. Rimm said there are also issues of
food preparation. Dr. Clemens said food processing also changes fats.
Dr. Nickols-Richardson asked if there could be a question on the relationship between fats and
food enjoyment, since diet satisfaction affects compliance. Dr. Pearson said there is literature on
fats and hedonics and that it might be worth it to have a speaker on that.
