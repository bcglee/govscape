Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 6
Maureen Ternus, MS, RD, Executive Director of the International Tree Nut Council
Nutrition, Research and Education Foundation, said very few people actually consume the
FDA-qualified health claim for nuts and heart disease recommended amount of nuts per day.
Since the 2005 Guidelines were published, there have been more studies showing the positive
role of nuts in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes and a positive effect on
weight and satiety. Approximately 60 percent of nuts are consumed as snacks, and many people
obtain 25 percent of their calories from snacks. Replacing some snacks that are high in refined
carbohydrates with 1/4 to 1/3 cup of nuts would increase the nutrient density of the diet and
reduce the risk of chronic illness.
Anne Banville of the USA Rice Federation, made three points. First, USA Rice supports the
goal of increasing whole grain consumption, but it should not be at the expense of enriched
grains, which provide folic acid. Second, most consumers do not understand the role and benefit
of carbohydrates. She urged the Committee to include education on the need for carbohydrates
and on the different kinds of carbohydrates in the 2010 Guidelines. Third, she recommended
that the 2010 guidelines educate consumers on the number of calories they need daily, a Know
Your Number campaign.
Constance Geiger, PhD, RD, CD, of the American Dietetic Association raised three points.
First, she recommended that the Dietary Guidelines be updated every 10 years, not every 5 years,
to provide more time both to strengthen the research base and for implementation. Second, she
recommended that the Guidelines focus on food-based recommendations and meal patterns.
Nutrient density and physical activity should be reviewed and reflected in the Guidelines, and
types and amounts of food people should eat, as well as those they should limit, should be
included. Finally, since fewer than 5 percent of Americans follow the Guidelines, consumer
research should be included in the studies.
Alex Lewin, PhD, from the Center for Science in the Public Interest recommended several
ways to strengthen the current recommendations. The salt guideline should be strengthened to
make people aware of the risk of consuming excessive sodium, the daily limits for sodium, and
the amount of sodium in restaurant and processed foods. The Dietary Guidelines should
encourage Americans to switch from refined grains to whole grains and should steer consumers
away from products that only appear to be whole grain. The Committee should advise on three
crucial contributors to excessive calorie intake: soft drinks, portion sizes of calorie-dense foods,
and restaurant food. Soft drinks are linked to obesity and are the number one source of calories
in Americansâ€™ diets. The Guidelines should provide practical advice on limiting intake. The
Guidelines should include advice on portion sizes. Eating out is linked to high calorie intake and
obesity. The Guidelines should address limiting the intake of calories, saturated and trans fats,
sugars, and sodium in restaurants. The sugars guideline should provide a quantitative
recommendation for added sugars, using the MyPyramid limits. The Guidelines should establish
a quantitative recommendation for trans fat. The Guidelines should be improved to provide
better guidance on alcoholic beverages, including the risks and calorie content of drinks,
including the calorie content of the mixers. The admonition on limiting cholesterol should be
retained. Finally, he recommended that the Committee look at the evidence linking food dyes to
behavior problems in children.
