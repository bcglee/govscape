Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 3
and beans group. She pointed out that lean red meat is especially nutritionally dense. A 3-ounce
serving of lean beef or pork provides the same amount of protein as a cup and a half of legumes,
with half the calories. She noted the role of protein in satiety, preserving lean body mass, and
preventing sarcopenia. She said the published science supports lean meat’s role in a healthy diet
and asked that DGAC consider this in their deliberations.
Sue Levin, a dietitian for the Physicians’ Committee for Responsible Medicine, said obesity
has increased, despite the Dietary Guidelines. The guidelines were written for healthy people,
who make up a minority of Americans. She noted high rates of cardiovascular disease and
diabetes. She said animal products in the diet are high in fat and cholesterol and devoid of fiber.
She recommended that the Guidelines support low-fat diets and include more information on the
benefits of a vegetarian diet, which should be recommended as the ideal diet. She said science
supports a low-fat, plant-based diet for optimal health and that vegan and vegetarian diets offer
nutritional benefits, including protection from diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and cancer. She
urged the Committee to rely on the research when writing the Guidelines.
Mary K. Young, MS, RD, Vice President for Nutrition with the National Cattlemen’s Beef
Association, said the industry has responded to government recommendations that Americans
reduce their fat and cholesterol intake. Today’s pork is 30 percent leaner than 30 years ago.
Today’s beef is 20 percent leaner than 14 years ago. Producers have used feeding and breeding
techniques to produce leaner animals, and meat in the supermarkets is practically devoid of
external fat. Pork tenderloin and sirloin steak have less than less than 2 grams of saturated fat in
a 3 ounce serving. Lean beef or pork cuts, which make up the majority of beef and pork sales,
have only one gram more of saturated fat per serving than a serving of skinless chicken breast.
Not all animal fat is saturated fat. In beef, 50 percent of the fat is monounsaturated, and one
third of the fat in pork is stearic. She urged the Committee to consider the nutrient density and
reduced fat in lean red meat.
Neal Barnard, MD, President of the Physicians’ Committee for Responsible Medicine, said
prospective studies show that people who eat meat have shorter lifespans and a greater risk of
cardiovascular disease and other illnesses. Merely limiting meat intake only reduces LDL
cholesterol levels by 5 percent. A vegetarian or vegan diet reduces LDL cholesterol by 13 to 37
percent. He said vegetarian diets reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer.
He said dairy products have problems similar to meat and that the nutrients in milk are available
from plant sources. He concluded that the Guidelines should emphasize the health benefits of
avoiding meat and the importance of making vegetarian and vegan foods a part of children’s
routines, including in school lunches.
James O. Hill, PhD, President of the American Society for Nutrition, offered ASN’s service
as a resource for evaluating the science. ASN endorses the recommendations made by Dr. Janet
King, Chair of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, in her letter to HHS and
USDA. The recommendations were that there be transparency in the translation of DGAC’s
report into the Dietary Guidelines; that food accessibility, marketing, economics, and culture be
considered when reviewing the Guidelines to increase compliance; that non-evidence-based
approaches supplement the systematic review, including food modeling, to fit the needs of
subpopulations; and that the 2010 process address nutrient density (especially that of beverages),
