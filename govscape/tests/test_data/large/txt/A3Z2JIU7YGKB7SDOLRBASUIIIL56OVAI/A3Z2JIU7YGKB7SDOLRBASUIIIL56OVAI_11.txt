Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 12
nutritious foods. Fruits and vegetables should be promoted aggressively through coordinated
efforts of government agencies, PBH, industry educators, and individuals.
Becky Domokos-Bays, Director of Food and Nutrition Services for Alexandria City Public
Schools in Virginia, spoke on behalf of the School Nutrition Association. Schools
participating in the School Lunch or School Breakfast programs are required to serve meals
consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and they are committed to serving the
most nutritious meals possible within the reimbursement rates. Since 2007, SNA members have
begun proactively implementing the recommendations of the 2005 DGAs. SNA supports dietary
guidelines that provide consistent standards for schools throughout the country. The guidelines
should allow for a consistent and understandable meal pattern for school meals that is practical,
achievable, and applicable to competitive foods sold outside of the program. SNA believes that
the DGAs should apply to all foods and beverages sold in schools. Implementing this would
require collaboration with all stakeholders. The Guidelines should be practical, achievable, and
written in plain language. SNA looks forward to working with DGAC.
Maureen Storey, Senior Vice President for Science Policy for the American Beverage
Association, said good health is not just about diet but also about a lifestyle that includes healthy
choices, such as physical activity. ABA encourages the consumption of a balanced, moderate,
varied diet and adequate physical activity to maintain energy balance. No one food or beverage
should be branded as good or bad. She said the 2010 DGA should focus on the total diet,
physical activity, and the role energy plays in maintaining a healthy weight. Additionally, she
suggested a guideline for hydration. The IOM has stated that water is the most important
nutrient for the body, and all beverages contribute to daily hydration needs.
Diana Zuckerman, PhD, President of the National Research Center for Women and
Families, first addressed methylmercury in fish. FDA has recently released a draft report that
has been strongly criticized and that has methodological flaws. She encouraged the Committee
to not be influenced by that report. The 2005 report recommended a limit of 12 ounces of fish
per week for pregnant and nursing women. However, only certain fish are high in mercury. She
suggested that the Guidelines distinguish between fish that are and those that are not high in
mercury. The second issue was Bisphenol A, an estrogen in the linings of canned food and
beverages. NIH and CDC have found that the chemical gets into the food and beverages and into
the body. People with high Bisphenol A levels are more likely to have diabetes and heart
disease, and it may affect cognitive development and mood. She hoped the Committee would
look at these issues.
Chair Van Horn thanked the presenters.

Committee and staff will use the Library. Following the meeting, the Committee will finalize
and prioritize the research questions. Staff will upload the topic area outline and template tasks
associated with conducting the evidence review for each question. Staff will assist the
Committee in defining the literature search and sort plans for each question, and a research
