Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 27
significance of added sugar intake to human health. The subcommittee will look at the work on
added sugar intake and human health published since 2004. The fifth question looked at the
major health benefits of fiber-containing foods. Exploratory searches have revealed new data
supporting the existing recommendations, so the recommendation will probably not be changed,
just strengthened.
The subcommittee also took up an issue from Section 6 of the 2005 report, Selected Food
Groups, Fruits and Vegetables, Whole Grains, and Milk Products. There will be overlap with
other subcommittees, but the subcommittee wants to pick up on any new data since 2004 on
legumes, seeds, nuts, and other plant products.
The subcommittee plans a literature search on the optimal proportion of dietary carbohydrates
and protein to maintain BMI and to achieve long-term weight loss. The subcommittee will also
look at caloric compensation for liquids versus solid foods, though the strategy for this is not yet
decided upon. The subcommittee is looking at low-calorie diets and how reducing calories
affects the carbohydrate/protein balance. With this issue comes the consideration of different
types of carbohydrates: sugars, complex carbohydrates, and fibers and how they affect body
weight and maintenance. In many studies, the carbohydrates are not broken down by these
categories. Generally, carbohydrates and fiber are protective of weight maintenance. Recent
studies suggest that information on glycemic index and glycemic load will not help people make
better carbohydrate choices, so it is probably best to recommend high-fiber, complex
carbohydrates. The subcommittee is looking for evidence regarding the role of artificial non-
nutritive sweeteners as an aid in weight loss or maintenance and has planned literature searches.
They are also looking for literature on non-digestible carbohydrates, prebiotics, probiotics and
whole foods. For whole foods, they are looking at epidemiological data to find what benefits
they have.
The subcommittee is developing a PICO chart and planning a literature search to update the
literature on the relationship between carbohydrates and dental caries and root caries. Dr. Nelson
suggested handling the sugar-free gum issue here. Dr. Slavin said it can fit there, if there is data.
Dr. Fukagawa said oral health is a broad outcome that includes more than caries and is
influenced by, among other things, fluoridated water. Terms such as periodontal disease, oral
health, root issues, and gum disease should be considered. Dr. Appel suggested starting with the
disease and working back; focusing on dental caries as an outcome and then clinical trials to
provide some idea of what potential exposures have been tested.
Dr. Slavin said the 2005 question asking about what the utility of the glycemic index and
glycemic load for providing dietary guidance for Americans will be separated into two sub-
questions, one on the utility of glycemic index for providing dietary guidance for Americans and
one on the utility of glycemic load for providing dietary guidance for Americans. Dr. Pi-Sunyer
said there has been much work on these questions since 2004 to assist in updating the literature.
Dr. Appel pointed out that the glycemic load issues are heavily confounded by surrogates. Dr.
Pi-Sunyer said the issue was handled last time by recommending food groups that would lead to
a lower glycemic index and load. Dr. Rimm pointed out that highly processed whole grains can
have a glycemic index very similar to white bread. The words “minimally processed” might be
