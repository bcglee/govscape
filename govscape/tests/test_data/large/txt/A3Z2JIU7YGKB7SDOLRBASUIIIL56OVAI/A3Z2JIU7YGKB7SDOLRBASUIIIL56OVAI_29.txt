Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 30
women, and people operating machinery. The subcommittee is interested in identifying those at
risk for overconsumption. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has been
contacted for such data. There are also potential research questions related to alcohol
metabolism, effect on diet, lipogenesis, glycemic effect of a meal, and bowel function. These
have not been addressed in past Guidelines and will require a longer search. The subcommittee
is developing PICO formats to build on the old questions and refine the new questions. He
opened the floor for discussion.
Chair Van Horn said drinking is expensive and wondered how it can impact food-buying
decisions. Dr. Pearson noted that much of the cost of alcohol is taxes. Chair Van Horn
wondered how the economic crisis would affect alcohol consumption. Dr. Rimm said he would
like to update the caloric content and alcohol content of drinks, since they have risen. Dr. Slavin
noted the high carbohydrate and alcohol contents in flavored malt beverages. Dr. Rimm agreed,
noting that the caloric effect of mixers and flavorings was a factor. Chair Van Horn said the data
does exist. Dr. Nelson expressed interest in eating patterns and the average dinner. Dr. Perez-
Escamilla said the data exists. Dr. Williams asked if the recommendations should be broken
down by populations with preexisting conditions. Dr. Rimm agreed, noting that moderate
drinking can actually reduce heart disease risk in diabetics. Of course, excessive drinking is
good for no one. He said there is talk of putting nutritional labeling on alcoholic beverages, but
it probably will not happen before 2010. Ms. McMurry said the Department of Treasury is
undergoing such a rulemaking process.

Fatty Acids Subcommittee
Discussion Leader: Tom Pearson
Dr. Pearson reported on the subcommittee activities. The first activity was to look at the 2005
Guidelines. There were seven questions in 2005 looking at the relationships of the major dietary
fats components to health, each with sizable literature. The evidence will be updated, but the
Guidance is unlikely to change, though there may be sub-questions on specific levels and
contexts. The subcommittee will look at trends in fatty acid consumption. The subcommittee
will use Healthy People 2020 data and invite speakers to fill gaps.
The next question was, “What should the average daily intakes of total fat, saturated fat, and
dietary cholesterol be in order to achieve or maintain the goal of desirable plasma LDL
cholesterol, 100 milligrams per deciliter or less?” That cholesterol level is the point at which the
progression of arterial graphically-defined coronary disease progression ceases. LDL cholesterol
levels are related to fats, and the concern is whether total and LDL cholesterol in the US
population is above the threshold that would control an epidemic of cardiovascular disease.
Since the real goal is controlling atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the subcommittee
considered whether to reconsider the goal for fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol. The
question was, “Should some of the goals for, total fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol be
reconsidered under the new goal of really controlling atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?”
