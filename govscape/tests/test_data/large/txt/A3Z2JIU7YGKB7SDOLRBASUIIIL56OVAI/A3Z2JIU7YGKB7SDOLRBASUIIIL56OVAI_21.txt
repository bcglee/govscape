Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 22
Friday, January 30, 2009 (8:11 a.m.)
Dr. Van Horn opened the second day’s session and invited Dr. Nickols-Richardson to begin the
day’s discussions.
Nutrient Adequacy Subcommittee
Discussion Leader: Shelly Nickols-Richardson
Dr. Nickols-Richardson began by acknowledging the other members of the Nutrient Adequacy
subcommittee. The subcommittee has had three conference calls and has identified several broad
research areas in which the questions fall. The subcommittee looked at the 2005 Dietary
Guidelines and identified the broad-scope questions. New research questions have emerged
around dietary patterns, behaviors, food environment, and specific nutrients. One question from
2005 asked what nutrients are most likely to be consumed by the general public in amounts low
enough to be of concern. That led to the sub-question asking what the health effects of the
nutrient shortfall are. The shortfall nutrients appear to be the same as those from 2005, so the
focus will be more on health outcomes.
Another question from the 2005 Guidelines asked how the flexibility of food patterns can be
increased. The subcommittee has considered eliminating the question but are continuing to look
at flexibility in the context of other content areas or questions.
A major research question in 2005 asked what dietary pattern is associated with achieving
recommended nutrient intakes. The subcommittee is looking at recommended nutrient intakes,
micronutrients, phytochemical properties of diets, and patterns such as breakfast intake. The
subcommittee is looking at how SoFAAS intake affects overall nutrient adequacy of the diet.
The subcommittee is considering what dietary patterns are associated with positive health
outcomes and looking for dietary patterns with robust evidence to give guidance. They are
looking at MyPyramid, DASH, vegetarianism and other diets.
Dr. Pearson said the fatty acid group was addressing a similar question. He said part of the
robustness of evidence is the length of the study, and much of the evidence doesn’t go past six
months. Dr. Nelson said the issue of dietary patterns is an overarching question that is not
specific to nutrition adequacy, so duplication of effort should be avoided.
Dr. Nickols-Richardson proceeded to modification of a question from 2005, what factors
related to diet or physical activity may help or hinder achieving recommended nutrient intakes.
The subcommittee modified the question to ask what environmental factors related to diet are
associated with achieving recommended nutrient and food group intakes. This is another place
where cross-cutting issues may occur. Dr. Appel said that will be a difficult question to address,
since “environmental factors” is a broad field. Dr. Nickols-Richardson said the subcommittee is
looking at economy, social and cultural issues, accessibility, availability, and away-from-home
eating. Another new question is looking at behaviors related to achieving recommended nutrient
