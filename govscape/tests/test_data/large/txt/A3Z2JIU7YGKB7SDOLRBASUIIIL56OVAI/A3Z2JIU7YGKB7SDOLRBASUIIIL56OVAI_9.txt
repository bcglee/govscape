Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting, January 29-30, 2009 10
Penny Kris-Etherton, PhD, RD, a 2005 DGAC member, spoke for the American Heart
Association. AHA has established a series of dietary, physical activity, and weight control
guidelines. She made several recommendations to the committee. First, the Guidelines should
set a limit on sugar intake, restricting it to less than half of discretionary calories. Second, the
Committee should emphasize fish and plant foods as protein sources. Other protein sources
should be lean. Third, The Committee should encourage consumption of healthier fats and
recommend consumption of 250 to 200 mg of EPA and DHA per day and request that the
Institute of Medicine (IOM) update the dietary reference intake (DRI) recommendations on
essential fatty acids. The recommendations for saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids should
be reduced. Fourth, the sodium recommendation should be reduced to 1500 mg per day.
Dawn Moncrief Director of Well-Fed World, said reduced meat consumption, vegetarianism,
and veganism reduces many chronic diseases. The benefits of a plant-based diet should be
included made clear, and a plant-based diet should be encouraged. Refined, processed, high-fat
or high-sugar foods should be discouraged. Since studies have linked animal foods to health
problems, animal-based products should be discouraged, not recommended. Recommendations
should be easy to understand and should provide details in each category for health-conscious
consumers. She suggested renaming the food groups to correspond to their purpose, such as
renaming the meat and dairy groups the protein and calcium groups.
Ilene Smith, RD, Senior Vice President and Associate Director of the Food and Nutrition
Practice of Ketchum, said that, in 2008, Ketchum commissioned Food 2020, a global study on
consumers’ food concerns. The results showed that consumers want more information, choices,
accountability, and control. Taste, quality, and price are top considerations in choosing food,
followed by health benefits. The importance of taste makes it difficult to change consumers’
eating habits. Consumers also want to know what’s in their food and where it comes from, not
only in terms of ingredients, but also in terms of conscience-based concerns. Consumers said
that, in the future, their concerns will be nutritional value and health benefits.
Amie Hamlin, Director of the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food, spoke on the
quality of school lunches. The majority of school meals are not health-supporting. She
recommended that, since school meals should be consistent with the guidelines, the food groups
be renamed. The meat and beans group change to the protein group, and that plant proteins be
the primary source, since they are healthier. She said the dairy group should become the calcium
group, since many people cannot digest dairy. She also noted that raising livestock causes global
warming. She said grain consumption should be primarily whole grain. She asked that the
statement that most calories should come from plant sources, which was removed from the 2005
Guidelines, be restored and emphasized.
Chris Phillips spoke for David Katz, MD, MPH, FACPM, FACP, representing NuVal,
LLC, which has developed the Overall Nutritional Quality Index. The system computes a score
for food and beverage products. He said food choices are usually not made with a plan in mind.
Effective dietary guidance should encompass both the whole diet and specific food choices. The
ONQI takes a number of factors, including nutritional content and health outcomes, into
consideration to score foods with a single number. Mr. Phillips encouraged the Committee to
look at all the available systems as ways of simplifying the message to consumers and offer the
