Hardwood percentages and volumes presented in the
tables represent just trees measured in this study of 81
active harvest operations. However, it is possible to apply
the percentages to inventory data from Texas’ seventh
survey to provide an estimate of total hardwood logging
residue for the State. Annual hardwood removals from all
live trees totaled 211.4 million cubic feet. Hardwood
growing-stock removals totaled 167.0 million cubic feet,
or 79 percent of that total. Applying factors from this
study to total hardwood removals from all live trees tallied
Utilized in the State survey provided an estimate of 53.54 million
90% cubic feet total annual hardwood residue. Of that total,
16.13 million cubic feet, or 30 percent, was considered
growing-stock residue. The remaining 70 percent, or 37.41
million cubic feet, was nongrowing-stock residue from
stumps, tops and limbs, and rough or rotten trees that were
