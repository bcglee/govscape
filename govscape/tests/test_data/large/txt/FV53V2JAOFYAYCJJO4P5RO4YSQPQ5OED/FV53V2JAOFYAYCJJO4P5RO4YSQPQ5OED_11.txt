utilized or 2,366 cubic feet, was left onsite as logging residue (fig.
(residue) 6). Thirty-three percent of residue volume came from the

growing-stock portion of trees, and 67 percent came from
the nongrowing-stock portion (stumps, tops, and limbs)
(fig. 7) (table 1).
The total hardwood growing-stock volume measured was
8,123 cubic feet. Of that total, 90.3 percent was used, and
9.7 percent was logging residue (fig. 8). By FIA merchant-
ability standards, the logging residue portion is under-
utilized volume. Of the total utilized volume, 253 cubic
feet, or 3.33 percent, was from the nongrowing-stock
portion of trees. By the same merchantability standards, that
volume is considered overutilization (tables 8 and 9).

level, softwood volumes and percentages were tabulated for volumes and percentages are also shown for the two
the Southeast and Northeast regions of Texas (fig. 2), as

Softwood percentages and volumes presented in these 24 %
tables represent just trees measured in this study of 81
active harvest operations. However, it is possible to apply
the percentages to inventory data from Texas’ seventh
survey to get an estimate of total softwood logging residues
for the State. Annual softwood removal from all live trees
was 506.3 million cubic feet. Softwood growing-stock
removals were 493.6 million cubic feet, or 97 percent of the
total. Applying the factors from this study to total softwood
removals for all live trees tallied in the State survey
provides an estimate of 75.9 million cubic feet total annual
softwood residue. Of the total residue for all live trees,

million cubic feet, was nongrowing-stock residue from
stumps, tops and limbs, and cull trees not used.
