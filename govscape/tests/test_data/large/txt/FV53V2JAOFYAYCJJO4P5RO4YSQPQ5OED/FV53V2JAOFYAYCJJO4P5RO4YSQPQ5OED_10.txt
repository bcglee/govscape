The total softwood growing-stock volume measured was
37,698 cubic feet. Of that total, 95.8 percent was utilized,
and 4.2 percent was logging residue (fig. 5). By FIA
merchantability standards, the logging residue portion of
growing-stock trees is underutilized volume. Of the total
utilized volume, 945 cubic feet, or 2.55 percent, was from
the nongrowing-stock portion of trees. By the same
merchantability standards, that volume is considered
overutilization (tables 2 and 3).
Softwood volumes and percentages are broken down
further by poletimber and sawtimber, and by the various
Utilized products measured (tables 4 through 7). By product, trees
87 % harvested for pulpwood and composite panels had the
highest rates of utilization for the merchantable portion of
the tree (97 percent) and the highest rates of overutilization
Total 42.8 thousand cubic feet (10 percent). This means that more of the nongrowing-
