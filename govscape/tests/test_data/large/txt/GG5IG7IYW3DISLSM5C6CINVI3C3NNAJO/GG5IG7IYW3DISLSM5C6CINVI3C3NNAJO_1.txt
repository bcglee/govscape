Preserved tissues from each elk were trimmed and

contained a cross section of obex containing the dorsal
motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The second cassette
containedasinglesectionfromeachoftheretropharyngeal
lymph nodes and one section of palatine tonsil. The third
cassette contained multiple cross sections of the strip of
rectal mucosa. Blocks were sectioned at 5 mm, and tissue
