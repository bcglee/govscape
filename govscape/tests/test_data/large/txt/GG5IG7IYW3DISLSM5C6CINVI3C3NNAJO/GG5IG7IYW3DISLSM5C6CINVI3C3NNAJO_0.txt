Abstract. Preclinical diagnostic tests for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have been described
for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), using biopsy tissues of palatine tonsil, and for sheep, using lymphoid
tissues from palatine tonsil, third eyelid, and rectal mucosa. The utility of examining the rectal mucosal
lymphoid tissues to detect chronic wasting disease (CWD) was investigated in Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus
elaphus nelsoni), a species for which there is not a live-animal diagnostic test. Postmortem rectal mucosal
sectionswereexaminedfrom308elkfromtwoprivatelyownedherdsthatweredepopulated.Theresultsofthe
postmortem rectal mucosal sections were compared to immunohistochemical staining of the brainstem,
retropharyngeal lymphnodes, andpalatine tonsil. Seven elkwere found positive usingthebrainstem (dorsal
motornucleusofthevagusnerve),retropharyngeallymphnodes,andpalatinetonsil.Sixoftheseelkwerealso
found positive using postmortem rectal mucosal sections. The remaining 301 elk in which CWD-associated
abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrPCWD) was not detected in the brainstem and cranial lymphoid
tissueswerealsofoundtobefreeofPrPCWDwhenpostmortemrectalmucosalsectionswereexamined.Theuse
of rectal mucosal lymphoid tissues may be suitable for a live-animal diagnostic test as part of an integrated
management strategy to limit CWD in elk.
