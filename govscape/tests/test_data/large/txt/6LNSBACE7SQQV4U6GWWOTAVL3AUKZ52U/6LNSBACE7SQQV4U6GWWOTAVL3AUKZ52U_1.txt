Materials Center, plants were selected for hardiness. Seed from hardy plants were collected
and used to establish the San Juan germplasm field of narrow leaf penstemon.
Environmental Impact Assessment: San Juan germplasm narrow leaf penstemon is a
selection of naturally occurring germplasm. San Juan germplasm did not meet the
assessment of a plant, which could become invasive based on guidelines adopted by the
NRCS Plant Materials Program.
Anticipated Conservation Use: The potential uses of the San Juan germplasm include
erosion control, wildlife food/cover, restoration of disturbed sites, increasing plant diversity
of rangelands and for low water use beautification of urban and rural landscapes.
Anticipated Area of Adaptation: Narrow leaf penstemon is found from western Kansas
to southern Utah, southward into New Mexico and northern Arizona. It commonly inhabits
sandy places on plains, hills and dunes at 1520 to 2128 meters.
Availability of Plant Materials: Breeder and/or foundation seed will be maintained at the
NRCS New Mexico Plant Materials Center. Seed will be distributed to interested growers
through the New Mexico Crop Improvement Association.
