NOTICE OF RELEASE OF A SELECTION OF NARROW LEAF PENSTEMON
SELECTED CLASS OF GERMPLASM
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), United States Department of
Agriculture and the New Mexico State University (NMSU) Agricultural Science Center at
Los Lunas announce the release of a selected class of narrow leaf penstemon (Penstemon
angustifolius Nutt. ex. Pursh) for the southwestern United States.
As a selected release, this germplasm will be referred to as the San Juan Germplasm of
narrow leaf penstemon. It has been assigned the NRCS accession number 9066069. San
Juan germplasm is released as a selected class of certified seed (natural track).
The alternative release procedure is justified because existing commercial sources of narrow
leaf penstemon are inadequate. The commercial sources that do exist have not been selected
for performance under agronomic conditions. Propagation material of this species is needed
for ecosystem restoration and enhancement and for beautification in urban and rural
landscaping situations. The potential for immediate use is high. No commercial cultivars of
narrow leaf penstemon have been previously released.
Collection Site Information: San Juan germplasm was originally collected as seed in 1990
from native plants on BHP-Minerals Navajo Mine, south of the town of Fruitland, New
Mexico. Soils are sandy loams.
Location: North: 360 42.9
