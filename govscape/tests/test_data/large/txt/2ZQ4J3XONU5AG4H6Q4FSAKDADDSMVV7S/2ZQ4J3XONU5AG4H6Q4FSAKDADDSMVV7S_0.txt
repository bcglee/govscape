BASSWOOD drink or boiled it into syrup. They also ate young
basswood leaves and used the cambium for soups and
Tilia americana L. breads. Various medicinal uses were made of leaf
and bark extracts, and Iroquois used freshly cut bark

Contributed by: USDA NRCS National Plant Data Wildlife: Basswood is good browse and buds are
Center & the Biota of North America Program important for birds and deer in winter. Fruits are
eaten by birds and small mammals. The wood
decays easily and produces many cavities (especially
in trees past 120 years of age), which are used by
cavity-nesting animals (wood ducks, pileated
woodpeckers, other birds, and small mammals).
Basswood is a prolific nectar producer and
pollination by honeybees results in a choice grade of
honey.
Restoration: Basswood is planted as a shade tree or
ornamental. For sites of smaller size or with
compacted soils, other Tilia species may be more
suitable. Basswood is said to be a soil-enriching
species, bringing calcium and magnesium up from
deep in the soil profile and depositing it in leaf litter
on the surface.
