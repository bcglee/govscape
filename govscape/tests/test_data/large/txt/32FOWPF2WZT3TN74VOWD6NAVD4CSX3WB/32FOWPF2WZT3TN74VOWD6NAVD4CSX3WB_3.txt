EQUIPMENT USED FOR SEEDING
Ideally seed will be drilled into a prepared seedbed. Switchgrass may be planted with a
conventional drill because it has a hard, smooth seed coat. Conventional drills equipped to seed
alfalfa work well. Eastern gamagrass seed is about the size of corn seed and is best planted with
a corn planter. Big and little bluestem and indiangrass seed have appendages with fine hair and
will not pass through conventional equipment unless they can be ordered as "debearded" or
brushed seed. Debearded seed may pass through a conventional drill, though it may still be best
to use a special drill designed for fluffy seed. Seed drills advertised as "native grass drills", such
as a Tye or Truax drill, have special boxes equipped with picker wheels and augers which help
prevent seed from sticking together and move the seed to the drilling mechanism. Many native
seed drills have multiple boxes, which allow for the sowing of both switchgrass and fluffy
seeded species at the same time. Switchgrass, indiangrass, and big and little bluestem should be
seeded at 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep. In sandy soils be especially careful not to bury seed too deep!
Eastern gamagrass is usually seeded at 1/2 to 3/4 inches deep. Planting native grasses with
conservation tillage equipment is not recommended at this time.
If a seed drill is not available, seed may be broadcast over a site. Broadcast fluffy seed (bluestem
and indiangrass) with a drop spreader or cyclone spreader and then drag to lightly cover seed. If
you are using a cyclone spreader, try mixing seed with inert matter such as kitty litter or sawdust
for better spreading. Successful broadcast seeding can be achieved by increasing seeding rate and
by rolling or cultipacking before and after seeding. When planting a small area (1/4-acre) in
droughty conditions, an optional step to enhance the stand would involve lightly mulching the
seeded area.
SEEDING RATES
Warm season grasses species vary in their growth characteristics. This makes it more difficult to
manage mixtures for pasture or hay use, so only one species should be seeded per field. In areas
planted for wildlife and erosion control the management of mixtures is not as critical.
Information is being developed on the use and adaptability on establishing native grasses in
mixtures.
Seeding rates for pasture and hay, wildlife, critical area treatment and conservation buffers are
found in the tables 1 and 2.
