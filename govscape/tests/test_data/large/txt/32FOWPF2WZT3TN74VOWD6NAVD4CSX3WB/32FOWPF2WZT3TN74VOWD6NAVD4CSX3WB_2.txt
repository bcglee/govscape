PURCHASING SEED
It is best to purchase certified seed of varieties adapted to the region of planting. Certified seed is
guaranteed to be true to a variety, and use of certified seed may lead to a more reliable planting. It is
best to order different species and varieties separately instead of pre-mixed because seeding and
management specification will differ between species.
Warm season grass species should be purchased on a pure live seed (PLS) basis. Do not
confuse 12 lb PLS/acre with 12 bulk lb/acre. Failure to recognize PLS when purchasing seed
and figuring seeding rates may yield unexpected results.
TIME OF SEEDING
Warm season grasses are best established during March through May. Early planting is critical even
though warm season grasses do not germinate until soil temperatures are above 50 to 55 degrees F.
Avoid planting after June 1 because moisture and weed competition may delay stand establishment.
Early establishment allows seedlings to develop good root systems before summer drought and
greatly increases the ability of the grasses to compete with weeds. Irrigation (if available) should
be applied when soil conditions are very dry to enhance seed germination and stand
establishment.
Seeding into warm soil in late spring can be helpful in controlling weeds. The first flush of weeds is
allowed to germinate and then is killed by final tillage or contact herbicide just prior to planting.
Ideally, this practice would result in the shortest period of bare ground and would get grass seedlings
up as quickly as possible to compete with other weeds.
SEEDBED FERTILITY
Warm season native grasses can be productive on low fertility soils, but fertilization will increase
plant vigor. Soil test the field prior to planting or cultivating. The pH should be adjusted to
around 6.0 if needed. Incorporate lime in the fall to allow it time to adjust pH before planting in
the spring. Fertility should be up to medium levels for phosphorous (P), and potassium (K).
Incorporate P and K into the soil at planting time. Do not apply nitrogen (N) at or before
planting time. Nitrogen and phosphorous have been shown to increase productivity. However,
nitrogen promotes weed growth, as well. Unless weed competition is low, N should be excluded
the first year until a stand becomes established. The only exception for N application is planting
critical sites, such as log decks, log roads, skid trails and other impoverished soils.
In addition to the above guidelines, follow the fertilizer and lime recommendation in your state.
Consult your Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) for more specific information based on site
and soils.
SEEDBED PREPARATION
Native warm season grasses are best established by creating a tilled, firm seedbed. It is best to
remove all vegetative cover through the use of approved herbicides or extensive tillage.
Seedbeds should be adequately plowed, disked and packed prior to planting. A cultipacker
works well for firming the seedbed. If a prepared hard seedbed is rained on before planting,
harrow and cultipack again before planting.
