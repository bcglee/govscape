NATIVE GRASS DRILLS
Planting with a no-till drill designed for native warm season grass seed is highly recommended. Do not drill seed any
deeper than ¼ inch! In fact, as much as 30 percent of the seed should be obvious on top of the planting furrow.
Drilling – For even grass distribution and a continuous, solid stand, native warm season grasses
planted for wildlife should be planted with a drill. When planting bluestems or indiangrass, a
drill with a specialized seed box containing “picker wheels” is necessary or the fluffy seed of
these grasses will lodge in the seed chute. These drills often are available for use through state
wildlife agencies, soil conservation districts, the Natural Resources Conservation Service and
some local chapters of Quail Unlimited. Switchgrass can be planted with a conventional drill.
Any drill, however, must be calibrated before planting. Refer to manual for proper settings to
calibrate drill in accordance to manufacturer recommendations. Eastern gamagrass is usually
planted with a corn planter in rows 18-24 inches apart, but some producers like to plant rows
only 12 inches apart to reduce stool size and make stems more upright so haying is easier.
Native grass drills can be used to plant eastern gamagrass.
