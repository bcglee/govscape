ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIVE WARM SEASON GRASSES
Native warm season grasses need special attention given during purchasing, planting and
management of established stands. The following features make native warm-season grass
planting different from other traditional plantings:
• Planting rates for warm season grasses are based on pure live seed (PLS) lb/acre and NOT
bulk lb/acre.
• All warm-season grasses require a firm seedbed for best establishment.
• Traditional seeding equipment works well for switchgrass and eastern gamagrass, but fluffy-
seeded species such as big bluestem, little bluestem and indiangrass require special
equipment and/or techniques for successful seedings.
