SEED QUALITY
Warm season grasses can be quite variable in germination rate and the purity of seed. Pure Live
Seed (PLS) should always be used when purchasing seed and to determine the bulk amount of
seed necessary for a planting. It may be necessary to increase your seeding rate to provide the
recommended rates of pure live seed.
Recommended Varieties of Switchgrass for Use in Georgia
Switchgrass
'Alamo' 'Alamo' switchgrass is highly recommended throughout the southeast.
It has been fully tested for conservation uses and is recommended for
forage, buffers, wildlife plantings, critical area treatment, shoreline
and streambank stabilization and nutrient reclamation.
'Cave-In-Rock' 'Cave-In-Rock' is recommended in the northern portion of the
Southeastern Region. Not as good on critical sites as 'Alamo'.
Adapted to lowland and upland sites with good palatability and animal
gains. More dormant seed than 'Blackwell' and tends to be slow to
establish. It is a good variety for wildlife plantings.
'Blackwell' Not well adapted in the lower southeastern portion of the Southeastern
Region. Can be used in mixed stands for wildlife plantings. Less
forage production than 'Cave-In-Rock. Fine stemmed and rust
resistant
'Shelter' Adapted mostly for wildlife plantings. Not recommended for forage
and/or erosion control.
Miami These relatively new pre-varietal releases (source-identified) which
Stuart are adapted for use in Florida. The conservation uses include forage,
Wabasso wildlife and critical area treatment. These releases are established
vegetatively.
