many types of seed on areas that are too small, too steep, or inaccessible for other types of
seeding equipment. The manually operated model is fitted with a hand crank and
shoulder strap for carry across the field or small plots.
The Seed Slinger is a broadcast seeder developed for surface broadcast application of
native prairie grass and forb species as well as some introduced grass and legume species.
The Seed Slinger seed hopper features two seed compartments. The large compartment is
for large fluffy, chaffy seeds such as, big bluestem, little bluestem, and indiangrass, The
second smaller compartment is for smaller, hard seed such as switchgrass, alfalfa, clover
species, etc.
