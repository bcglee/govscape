Investigations were conducted to determine optimum 15
procedures for creating a seedbed to enhance rooting with 20 20
conservation tillage components. Soil strength was found to
be reduced by in-row tillage performed either in fall or
spring, at either shallow (7") or deep (13") depths. Reduced
values of cone index and bulk density were found from the
20
more recent spring tillage as compared to fall tillage
performed almost 12 months prior. Cover crops were found 25 20
to be effective in reducing soil strength in spring due to
increased soil moisture. By fall, however, no differences
could be seen in cone index profiles or bulk density
