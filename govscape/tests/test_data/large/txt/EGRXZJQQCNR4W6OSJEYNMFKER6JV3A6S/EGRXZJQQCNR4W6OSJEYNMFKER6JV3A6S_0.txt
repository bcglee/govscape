RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF DIOXINS AND| FURANS IN ADIPOSE TISSUE
)
In a limited study conducted in 1979-1980, the Veterans Administration (VA)
found that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) could be detected
and quantified in adipose tissue removed from Vietnam-era veterans. Although
there was no clear relationship between levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and either
Vietnam service, exposure to Agent Orange, or current health status, the study
indicated the need for further investigation. The VA, in cooperation with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established an interagency agreement
to study levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in adipose tissue from a selected group of U.S.
males.
Since 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency has been annually collecting
adipose tissue for its National Human Adipose Tissue Survey. Adipose Tissue is
collected from a statistically representative segment of the general population
and analyzed for residues of selected organochlorine pesticide-related chemicals
and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Approximately 12,000 specimens have been
collected and analyzed, and of these approximately 4,000 have excess tissue left
over from the original analysis which can be used for further chemical analyses.
These excess tissues are stored in a tissue bank at EPA's Toxicant Analysis
Center, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Represented within this bank is adipose
tissue from 555 males born between 1937 and 1952. Many of these individuals
will have served in the military during the Vietnam-era and some will have
served in Vietnam during the period of Agent Orange use. A retrospective study
of selected chlorinated dioxins and furans (chemicals similar in structure to
the dioxins) may establish data on background levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in the U.S.
male population as well as whether service in the military and especially in
Vietnam has had an effect on the levels of TCDD in adipose tissue.
The study will be conducted in three phases. Phase I will be to obtain the name
and social security number for the approximately 555 males noted above. This
information will be used to determine military service status. Phase II will be
the development of analytic methods for the determination of selected dioxins
(especially the 2,3,7,8-TCDD) and furans in human adipose tissue. The method
will be subjected to rigorous interlaboratory validation by an independent
Analytic referee, e.g., the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Phase
III will be the analysis of the adipose tissue and the preparation of a final
report. Phase I and II should be completed within calendar year 1983, and the
report from Phase III should be available in early 1985.
