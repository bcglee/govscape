The pattern of spray distribution across any particular appli-
cation was quite similar along the two collection lines (Appendix
C-10 to C-15). An expected lateral displacement of the spray pattern
was found with a crosswind, particularly at velocities greater than
3 mph. Some irregularities were found in distribution, but these
were not consistent for either aircraft. The amount of dye which was
recovered varied from 37 to 80 percent for the fall application and
from 13 to 50 percent for the spring application (Tables 2-3).
