The boom on the Allied equipment was suspended behind the power
unit at the tail of the skids, with the center nozzle 23 in above the
bottom of the skids. Thirty-eight nozzles were spaced according to
the contractor's experience to apply a 40-foot swath at the prescribed
gallonage. All applications were flown at a ground speed of 55 mph
using K-5 Floodjets (Spraying Systems, Inc.) to apply 10 gal/A and K-15
Floodjets to apply 20 gal/A.
The Boyl equipment was fitted with a 28-nozzle boom mounted on
the toe of the skids. Twenty-four Teejet 8015 nozzles (Spraying
Systems, Inc.) supplemented by 4 Teejet 8-45 nozzles just to left of
center were spaced 9 in apart, except the drops directly in front of
the skids were left plugged. The application was flown using swaths
40 ft wide at a ground speed of 30 mph with a nozzle pressure of 12
psi and a release height of 30 ft. Rotary-wing aircraft were loaded
adjacent to the experimental location.
The aircraft was guided during application by cloth flags at
either end of the swath. Flag locations were marked with colored tape
prior to treatment. The amount of material dispensed was measured at
the loading point. Distribution of granules was determined by col-
lecting and weighing material retained on cloth panels suspended with-
in a wire frame two feet square (Figure 6) and spaced 5 ft center to
center. Distribution of the spray material across the plot was deter-
mined from dye intercepted by mylar sample plates, four inches square,
distributed transversely to the line of flight and spaced 5 ft center
to center. Ten grams of carmine pontacyl dye (duPont) were added to
each gallon of spray mixture. The dye retained on each plate was
dissolved in 20 ml of 1:1 water: propanol (v/v). The dye solution was
analyzed using a Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter, and the
colorimetric readings were converted to gallons per acre by comparing
them with readings from standard solutions (Deonier et al, 1963).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Monitoring the application with sample devices was conceived
initially to aid in interpreting plant response, but it was installed
later as a distinct phase of this study. These data are subject only
to generalization; engineering controls were not used to measure such
variables as deviation of the vehicle from the flight line, height of
release of the applied material, or the precise wind vectors. Despite
these limitations, the distribution patterns measured indicate the
capabilities of the equipment used.
Two parameters are needed to physically evaluate an application.
These are (1) the actual delivery relative to the amount scheduled,
and (2) a profile of the distribution transverse to the line of
flight.
In this study the volumes of spray applied were much more con-
sistent and closer to the scheduled volume than were granular
