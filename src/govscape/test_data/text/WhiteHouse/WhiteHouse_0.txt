The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United
States. Located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., it has served
as the residence of
every U.S. president
since John Adams in
1800 when the
national capital was
moved from
[2]
Philadelphia. "The
White House" is also
used as a metonym to
refer to the Executive
Office of the
President of the
[3]
United States.
The residence was
[4]
designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the Neoclassical style. Hoban
modeled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the
Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Constructed between 1792 and 1800, its exterior walls
are Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the
house in 1801, he and architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe added low colonnades on
[5]
each wing to conceal what then were stables and storage. In 1814, during the War of
1812, the mansion was set ablaze by British forces in the burning of Washington,
destroying the interior and
charring much of the exterior.
Reconstruction began almost
immediately, and President
James Monroe moved into the
partially reconstructed Executive
Residence in October 1817.
Exterior construction continued
with the addition of the
semicircular South Portico in
1824 and the North Portico in
1829.
